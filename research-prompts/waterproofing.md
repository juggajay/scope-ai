# Research Prompt: Waterproofing Trade — Australian Residential Renovations

## Context for the Researcher

I'm building an AI-powered Scope of Works Generator for Australian homeowners planning renovations. Waterproofing is one of the most compliance-heavy trades in a residential renovation. Getting it wrong leads to the single most expensive defect in Australian homes — water damage. The Australian Standard (AS 3740) is very specific, and most states require certification.

Waterproofing applies primarily to **bathrooms, laundries, and any wet area**. It does NOT typically apply to kitchens (unless there's a floor waste, which is uncommon in kitchens).

This is a focused trade — narrow scope but extremely high importance.

## SECTION 1: Australian Standards & Compliance

This is the most important section. Research thoroughly:

- **AS 3740 — Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas** — The key standard. Document:
  - Which areas MUST be waterproofed? (shower, bathroom floor, laundry floor, over baths)
  - Minimum height requirements:
    - Shower walls — how high? (1800mm above finished floor level? or to ceiling? — this has changed)
    - Above baths — how high?
    - General bathroom walls — any requirement?
    - Bathroom floor — full floor or just shower area?
    - Laundry floor — requirements?
    - Behind/around basins?
  - Step-down / hob requirements at doorways (is a hob/lip still required? or can a setdown in the screed suffice?)
  - Floor waste requirements (fall to waste, minimum 1 per wet area?)
  - Junction details (floor-to-wall, wall-to-wall corners, pipe penetrations)
  - Bond breaker requirements
  - Membrane types approved under the standard

- **State-by-state licensing and certification:**
  - Who can do waterproofing in each state? (licensed waterproofer? plumber? builder?)
  - Is a separate waterproofing licence required? (NSW, QLD, VIC, etc.)
  - What certificate/documentation is required?
    - NSW: requires a Certificate of Waterproofing Compliance? Who issues it?
    - VIC: requirements?
    - QLD: BSA requirements?
    - Other states?
  - When is an independent inspection required vs self-certification?
  - Photographic evidence requirements (before tiling covers the membrane)

- **NCC/BCA requirements** — Any additional requirements beyond AS 3740?

- **Warranty requirements** — What warranty should waterproofing carry? Manufacturer warranty vs installer warranty? Typical duration?

- **Insurance implications** — If waterproofing fails and causes damage, what insurance covers it? Does non-certified waterproofing void home insurance?

## SECTION 2: Waterproofing Scope Items

### A. Bathroom Waterproofing

**Substrate Preparation:**
- Screed to falls (who does this — waterproofer, tiler, or builder? what's the typical scope?)
- Priming (what substrate needs what primer?)
- Bond breaker installation (internal corners — what is this and why?)
- Reinforcement tape/fabric (internal corners and junctions)
- Pipe penetration preparation (puddle flanges)

**Membrane Application:**
- Membrane type options:
  - Liquid-applied membrane (most common in Australia — brands: Ardex, Mapei, Laticrete, Sika, Gripset)
  - Sheet membrane (when used instead of liquid?)
  - Combination systems
- Number of coats (minimum 2 coats for liquid? check standard)
- Minimum dry film thickness (DFT) — what does AS 3740 require?
- Drying time between coats
- Wet film thickness testing (is this required?)
- Colour difference between coats (to ensure coverage — some systems use different colours)

**Area-Specific Requirements:**
- Shower floor (full waterproofing including hob/step-down)
- Shower walls (to what height? full height recommended even if not required?)
- Over bath (if bath against wall — to what height?)
- General bathroom floor (entire floor vs just wet zone?)
- Door threshold (step-down or hob detail — critical for preventing water migration)
- Toilet area (if separate from shower)
- Vanity area

**Fixtures and Penetrations:**
- Floor waste puddle flange (what is this? who installs it — plumber or waterproofer?)
- Pipe penetrations (sealing around hot/cold water pipes, waste pipes)
- Shower mixer penetration
- Toilet waste penetration

### B. Laundry Waterproofing

- What areas require waterproofing in a laundry?
- Is full floor waterproofing required? (check current AS 3740)
- Behind washing machine?
- Laundry tub area?

### C. Other Areas

- Balcony waterproofing (external wet area — different requirements?)
- Kitchen (typically NOT waterproofed unless floor waste present — confirm)
- Over habitable spaces (upper-level bathroom over a bedroom — enhanced requirements?)

## SECTION 3: Sequencing & Coordination — CRITICAL

Waterproofing is one of the most sequencing-sensitive trades. The entire bathroom timeline depends on getting this right.

Research the exact sequence:

```
1. Demolition/strip-out complete
2. Plumbing rough-in complete (waste, water supply, shower mixer positioned)
3. Electrical rough-in complete (in-floor heating mat if applicable, exhaust fan ducting)
4. Hob/shower base built (by builder/carpenter)
5. Screed laid (falls to waste — who does this?)
6. WATERPROOFING APPLIED (this scope)
7. HOLD POINT — Waterproofing inspection/certification
8. Drying/curing time (how long before tiling can start?)
9. Tiling can commence
```

- **What must be 100% complete before waterproofing?**
  - All plumbing rough-in
  - All electrical rough-in in the floor/walls
  - Shower hob/base
  - Screed (if required)
  - Substrate smooth and clean
- **What happens if a plumber or electrician needs to modify something AFTER waterproofing?**
  - The membrane is compromised — must be re-done
  - This is extremely expensive and causes major delays
  - This is why sequencing is critical
- **Inspection/certification BEFORE tiling:**
  - Who inspects?
  - What do they check?
  - How long does certification take?
  - Can the tiler start the same day as certification?
- **In-floor heating:**
  - Does the heating mat go UNDER or OVER the waterproof membrane? (this is a common question)
  - What coordination is needed?

## SECTION 4: Common Exclusions

- Screed/fall preparation (sometimes waterproofer does this, sometimes separate)
- Plumbing rough-in (must be done BEFORE waterproofing — plumber's scope)
- Puddle flanges (plumber supplies and installs?)
- Tiling (separate trade — starts AFTER waterproofing)
- Hob/shower base construction (builder/carpenter)
- Substrate repair (if existing substrate is damaged)
- Asbestos removal (if fibro substrate needs removal first)
- Council/certification fees

## SECTION 5: Pricing Guidance (For PC Sums)

Ballpark ranges for Australian capital cities:
- Bathroom waterproofing (standard bathroom — floor + shower walls to ceiling)
- Per square metre rate (supply and install)
- Shower only (floor + walls)
- Laundry waterproofing
- Balcony waterproofing
- Additional for puddle flanges/penetrations
- Inspection/certification fees (if separate)

---

## SECTION 6: Homeowner Mistakes & Critical Warnings

- **#1 Mistake: Tiling over waterproofing before it's been inspected/certified** — If the waterproofing fails later, ALL tiles must come off
- Not understanding that waterproofing is a separate trade from tiling
- Assuming the tiler will waterproof (some do, many don't — and quality varies)
- Not photographing the waterproofing before it's covered by tiles (documentation)
- Allowing plumber to come back after waterproofing to "just move one pipe"
- Cheap waterproofing products — what to look for in quality
- Not waterproofing high enough in shower (especially for rainfall/overhead showers that splash widely)
- Forgetting the door threshold detail (water migrates under door frame into adjacent rooms)
- Not understanding that waterproofing failure is the #1 defect in Australian residential construction
- Insurance implications of uncertified waterproofing

## Save Instructions

Save all research output as markdown files into the following directory:

```
C:\Users\jayso\scope-ai\research-output\waterproofing\
```

Split your output into multiple files by section grouping, using this naming convention:

```
RESEARCH-waterproofing-standards-compliance.md   → Section 1
RESEARCH-waterproofing-scope-items.md            → Section 2
RESEARCH-waterproofing-sequencing-coordination.md → Section 3
RESEARCH-waterproofing-exclusions.md             → Section 4
RESEARCH-waterproofing-pricing-guidance.md       → Section 5
RESEARCH-waterproofing-mistakes-warnings.md      → Section 6
```

Each file should include a sources list at the bottom. Create the directory if it doesn't exist. These files will be used to build AI system prompts for a scope-of-works generator.
