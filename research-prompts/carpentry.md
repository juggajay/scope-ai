# Deep Research Prompt: Carpentry & Joinery Trade — Australian Residential Renovations

## Context for the Researcher

I'm building an AI-powered Scope of Works Generator for Australian homeowners planning renovations. The tool generates professional carpentry and joinery scope documents that homeowners send to cabinet makers and carpenters for quoting. The scope needs to be detailed enough that:

1. A cabinet maker/carpenter reads it and can price accurately
2. Three different tradies can quote on identical items
3. Nothing critical is missed that would cause a variation later

Carpentry in a renovation context covers two distinct areas:
- **Joinery/Cabinetry** — kitchens, bathrooms, laundries (the cabinet maker)
- **Structural/Fix Carpentry** — framing, doors, architraves, skirting, timber floors, decks (the carpenter)

Some tradies do both. Many don't. The scope needs to be clear about which skills are needed.

## SECTION 1: Australian Standards & Compliance

Research and document:

- **NCC (National Construction Code) / BCA** — Requirements relevant to residential carpentry (fire ratings, structural timber grades, fixing requirements)
- **AS 1684 — Residential Timber-Framed Construction** — Key points affecting renovation scopes (span tables, load paths, bracing)
- **AS 4386 — Domestic Kitchen Installations** — What does this standard require?
- **Timber grades and species** — Common structural timber grades used in Australian residential (MGP10, MGP12, F7, etc.) and when each is appropriate
- **Licensing requirements by state** — Is a carpentry licence required? Builder's licence thresholds? At what point does the work require a licensed builder vs a tradesperson?
- **Building certification** — When does carpentry/framing work require an inspection? Who inspects?
- **Termite treatment requirements** — When does new timber framing require treatment? What types? (H2, H3, H4 treatment levels)
- **Fire rating requirements** — When do internal walls/ceilings need fire ratings in residential? (party walls, garage walls, etc.)
- **Warranty requirements** — What warranties apply to cabinetry? Statutory vs manufacturer?

## SECTION 2: Kitchen Cabinetry — Detailed Scope Items

Kitchen cabinetry is the single biggest joinery item in most renovations. I need exhaustive detail here.

### Cabinet Types and Specifications:

**Base Cabinets:**
- Standard dimensions (height, depth, widths)
- Carcass materials (particleboard, plywood, MR MDF — what's standard vs premium?)
- Door/drawer front materials and finishes:
  - Laminate/melamine (brands: Laminex, Polytec — what's the standard?)
  - 2-pac polyurethane (spray-painted, what sheen levels?)
  - Vinyl wrap / thermolaminate
  - Timber veneer
  - Solid timber
  - Acrylic/glass front
- Drawer systems (Blum, Hettich, Grass — what's standard vs premium? What models?)
- Soft-close hardware (standard now? or still a spec item?)
- Internal fittings (pull-out shelves, lazy susans, corner carousels, cutlery inserts, bin pull-outs)
- Sink cabinet (different construction for wet area)
- Dishwasher housing (filler panels, ventilation requirements)

**Overhead/Wall Cabinets:**
- Standard dimensions (height, depth)
- Door types (hinged, lift-up/bi-fold — Blum Aventos)
- Glass display cabinets
- Open shelving vs closed
- Rangehood cabinet/bulkhead
- Height above benchtop (standard is 600mm — confirm)
- Push-to-open (handleless) options

**Tall/Pantry Cabinets:**
- Full-height pantry (internal fitout — fixed shelves vs pull-out, Hafele, Vauth-Sagel systems)
- Appliance tower (wall oven, microwave niche — dimensions and ventilation requirements)
- Integrated fridge surround (dimensions, ventilation requirements)
- Broom cupboard

**Island Bench:**
- Construction methods (cabinet vs frame)
- Waterfall benchtop provision (what does the cabinet maker need to do?)
- Breakfast bar overhang (support bracket requirements, typical overhang depth)
- Services access (plumbing/electrical through island — coordination)
- Back panel finishing

**Other Kitchen Items:**
- Kickboards (matching, shadow line, recessed)
- Scribe/filler pieces (to walls)
- Handle/hardware selection (typically owner-selected — PC sum)
- End panels and return panels
- Bulkhead/soffit above overheads (to ceiling or gap?)
- Wine rack provisions
- Appliance garage (roller door cupboard on bench)

### Cabinet Quality Levels:

Research the typical quality tiers in Australian kitchen cabinetry:
- **Budget** — What does a budget kitchen look like? Materials, hardware, lead time?
- **Mid-range** — Standard for most renovations?
- **Premium** — What upgrades? (plywood carcass, premium hardware, custom sizes)
- **Luxury** — Bespoke, solid timber, European brands?

---

## SECTION 3: Bathroom & Laundry Cabinetry

- Vanity types (wall-hung vs floor-standing, single vs double)
- Vanity construction (must be moisture-resistant — MR MDF, marine ply)
- Mirror cabinets (surface mount vs recessed — structural implications)
- Laundry cabinets and benchtops
- Linen cupboards
- Shaving cabinets
- Toilet roll holder recesses / niches (is this carpentry or tiling?)
- Shower niche framing (if timber framed wall)

---

## SECTION 4: Structural & Fix Carpentry

Research scope items for general carpentry (not cabinetry):

**Framing/Structural:**
- New wall framing (stud walls — what goes into the scope? Timber size, spacing, top/bottom plates, noggings)
- Wall removal support (temporary propping, steel beam installation — coordination with structural engineer)
- Floor framing modifications (new openings, reinforcement)
- Ceiling framing (new bulkheads, raked ceilings, lowered sections)
- Door opening modifications (widening, creating new, closing off)
- Window modifications

**Fix Carpentry (Second Fix):**
- Door hanging (internal doors — hollow core, solid core, barn doors, cavity sliders)
- Door hardware (hinges, handles, locks — typically PC sum)
- Architrave installation (profiles — colonial, modern square-set, bullnose)
- Skirting board installation (profiles, heights)
- Window sills and reveals
- Built-in wardrobes (vs joinery — where's the line?)
- Shelving
- Stair modifications

**Timber Flooring:**
- Supply and install solid timber
- Supply and install engineered timber
- Sanding and polishing existing timber floors
- Staining and finishing options
- Transition strips between rooms/materials

**Decking:**
- Timber decking (species — Merbau, Spotted Gum, treated pine)
- Composite decking (brands — Trex, ModWood, NewTechWood)
- Subframe construction (bearers, joists, stumps/posts)
- Balustrade requirements (1000mm height, baluster spacing per BCA)
- Stairs and landings
- Pergola/shade structure
- Screening and privacy panels

## SECTION 5: Benchtop Coordination

The cabinet maker typically doesn't supply/install stone benchtops (that's the stone mason), but needs to coordinate:

- What does the cabinet maker need to do to prepare for stone benchtop?
- How is the template coordinated? (cabinets must be installed and level first)
- Laminate benchtops — are these supplied and installed by the cabinet maker? (usually yes)
- Timber benchtops — supply and install by carpenter?
- What are the substrate requirements for different benchtop materials?

---

## SECTION 6: Sequencing & Coordination

- **When does the cabinet maker need final measurements?** (after demolition, after any structural work)
- **Lead time for custom cabinetry** — Typical manufacturing lead times in Australia (4-8 weeks?)
- **Installation sequence:**
  - What must be done before cabinet installation? (plastering, painting primer coat?, floor levelling)
  - What happens after cabinet installation? (stone template, splashback tiling, second-fix plumbing/electrical)
- **Coordination with:**
  - Plumber: sink position, dishwasher position, island plumbing
  - Electrician: GPO positions relative to cabinets, under-cabinet lighting, rangehood wiring
  - Stone mason: template timing, sink/cooktop cut-out coordination
  - Tiler: splashback tiling timing relative to cabinet installation
  - Painter: paint before or after cabinets? (usually prime coat before, final coat after)

---

## SECTION 7: Common Exclusions

- Benchtop supply and install (stone — separate trade)
- Appliance supply
- Handles/hardware (usually PC sum — owner selects)
- Splashback (tiling or other)
- Painting (separate trade — but some cabinet makers paint doors?)
- Demolition of existing cabinetry (sometimes included, sometimes demolition scope)
- Plumbing and electrical (must be by licensed trades)
- Floor levelling/preparation

---

## SECTION 8: Pricing Guidance (For PC Sums)

Ballpark ranges for Australian capital cities:
- Complete kitchen cabinetry supply and install — by quality tier (budget/mid/premium/luxury)
- Per linear metre of cabinetry (base + overhead) — rough guide
- Bathroom vanity supply and install (by type)
- Door supply and hang (internal, including hardware)
- Architrave and skirting (per linear metre, supply and install)
- Timber flooring supply and install (per m², by species)
- Timber decking supply and install (per m², by species)
- Built-in wardrobe (per linear metre)
- Island bench cabinetry (additional cost over standard run)

---

## SECTION 9: Homeowner Mistakes & Red Flags

- Choosing cabinetry based on showroom without understanding material differences
- Not confirming exact appliance dimensions before cabinet order
- Underestimating lead times — cabinets are the longest lead time item
- Not understanding what "supply and install" includes for cabinetry
- Assuming handles are included in cabinet quote
- Not planning for services (GPOs behind cabinets, plumbing through island)
- Choosing a "cabinet maker" who's actually just an installer using flat-pack
- Not getting cabinetry design finalised before ordering (changes after order = expensive)

## Output Format

Organise under each section heading. Note sources and confidence. Present state-specific differences in table format. I need this thorough enough to write a system prompt for professional carpentry/joinery scopes.

## Save Instructions

Save all research output as markdown files into the following directory:

```
C:\Users\jayso\scope-ai\research-output\carpentry\
```

Split your output into multiple files by section grouping, using this naming convention:

```
RESEARCH-carpentry-standards-compliance.md          → Section 1
RESEARCH-carpentry-kitchen-cabinetry.md             → Section 2
RESEARCH-carpentry-bathroom-laundry-cabinetry.md    → Section 3
RESEARCH-carpentry-structural-fix-carpentry.md      → Section 4
RESEARCH-carpentry-benchtop-coordination.md         → Section 5
RESEARCH-carpentry-sequencing-coordination.md       → Section 6
RESEARCH-carpentry-exclusions.md                    → Section 7
RESEARCH-carpentry-pricing-guidance.md              → Section 8
RESEARCH-carpentry-mistakes-red-flags.md            → Section 9
```

Each file should include a sources list at the bottom. Create the directory if it doesn't exist. These files will be used to build AI system prompts for a scope-of-works generator.
