# Research Prompt: Painting Trade — Australian Residential Renovations

## Context for the Researcher

I'm building an AI-powered Scope of Works Generator for Australian homeowners planning renovations. The tool generates painting scope documents. Painting is typically the LAST trade on site (before final clean), and the scope needs to clearly define preparation, coats, finishes, and what surfaces are included.

Painting seems simple but is actually one of the most common sources of disputes — "I assumed the painting included the hallway" or "they only did one coat and it looks patchy." A clear scope prevents this.

## SECTION 1: Australian Standards & Compliance

- **AS/NZS 2311 — Guide to the Painting of Buildings** — Key requirements for residential work (surface preparation, coating systems, number of coats)
- **VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) regulations** — Current Australian limits on paint VOC content. Are low-VOC paints required or just recommended?
- **Lead paint considerations** — When was lead paint banned in Australia? What are the requirements when painting over surfaces that may contain lead paint (pre-1970 homes)?
- **Licensing** — Is a painting licence/trade certificate required in each state? Or can anyone paint?
- **Warranty** — What's a reasonable warranty period for professional painting work? What do major paint manufacturers warrant?

## SECTION 2: Paint Types & Specifications

Research the specifications that should appear in a painting scope:

**Paint Finishes/Sheens:**
- Flat/matt — where used (ceilings, low-traffic areas)
- Low sheen — where used (general walls — most common in Australian residential)
- Semi-gloss — where used (wet areas, trim, doors, high-traffic)
- Gloss — where used (trim, feature)
- How do different brands name their sheens? (Dulux, Taubmans, Haymes — naming varies)

**Paint Types:**
- Acrylic (water-based) — standard for walls and ceilings
- Enamel (oil-based vs water-based enamel) — for trim, doors, high-traffic
- Ceiling paint (specific formulation? or just flat acrylic?)
- Bathroom/wet area paint (anti-mould, moisture-resistant)
- Primer types (all-purpose, stain-blocking, new plaster, timber)
- Undercoat vs primer (difference?)

**Major Australian Paint Brands:**
- Dulux (Wash & Wear, Weathershield, etc.)
- Taubmans
- Haymes
- British Paints
- Wattyl
- What tier is each? (builder grade vs premium)
- Are there significant quality differences between brands?

**Colour Considerations:**
- Typically owner-selected (PC sum or owner supply)
- Number of colours in scope (common: 1-2 wall colours, 1 ceiling colour, 1 trim colour)
- Dark colours requiring additional coats (cost implications)
- Colour matching for touch-ups to existing areas

## SECTION 3: Painting Scope Items by Area

For each area, list scope items with specifications:

**A. Kitchen**
- Walls (how many coats on new plasterboard vs existing painted surfaces?)
- Ceiling
- Trim and architraves
- Window frames and sills
- Any feature colours (accent wall)
- Paint grade for kitchen (washable/scrubbable recommended)

**B. Bathroom**
- Walls (above tile line — semi-gloss or low sheen? anti-mould paint?)
- Ceiling (bathroom-specific paint, mould-resistant)
- Vanity (if painted — separate from cabinetry?)
- Trim
- How many coats in wet areas?

**C. Living Areas / Bedrooms**
- Walls
- Ceilings
- Trim, architraves, skirting
- Doors (both sides? edges?)
- Window frames
- Built-in wardrobes (if painted)
- Feature walls

**D. Exterior (if applicable)**
- Weatherboard painting (preparation is the main scope item)
- Render painting
- Eaves and fascia
- Window frames
- Front door
- Fence and gate
- Deck (stain/oil — different product)

**E. New Surfaces (Renovation-Specific)**
- New plasterboard — coating system (1 primer/sealer + 2 top coats minimum?)
- Patched/repaired surfaces — preparation and coating
- New timber (architraves, skirting, doors) — coating system
- Previously wallpapered surfaces — preparation requirements
- Painting over dark colours — additional coats needed?

## SECTION 4: Surface Preparation

This is where painting scope gets detailed. Prep is 70% of a good paint job.

Research:
- **New plasterboard:** Sealer/primer coat, sanding between coats, how many top coats?
- **Existing painted surfaces (good condition):** Wash, sand/scuff, how many coats?
- **Existing painted surfaces (poor condition):** Scraping, filling, sanding, priming, how many coats?
- **Previously wallpapered surfaces:** Removal, residue removal, skim coat?, priming
- **Timber surfaces (new):** Sanding, priming/undercoat, filling grain, top coats
- **Timber surfaces (existing):** Sanding, cleaning, priming if needed, top coats
- **Patching and filling:** What level of fill work is "normal" in a painting scope vs carpentry/plastering?
- **Caulking:** Internal corners, gaps between trim and walls — included in painting scope?
- **Masking and protection:** Floors, fixtures, fittings — who protects what?

---

## SECTION 5: Sequencing & Coordination

- **When does painting happen?** LAST trade — after all other work is complete
- **What must be done before painting starts?**
  - All plastering/patching complete and sanded
  - All trim, architraves, skirting installed
  - All second-fix electrical and plumbing complete (cover plates on)
  - Tiling complete
  - Cabinetry installed
  - Stone benchtop installed
  - All dust-generating work complete
- **Multi-stage painting approach:**
  - Is it common to do a primer/first coat BEFORE cabinetry, then final coats after?
  - When is this approach used and why?
- **Touch-up after other trades:** Is a touch-up visit standard? Who pays for it?
- **Drying times between coats** — How long? How does this affect scheduling?

---

## SECTION 6: Common Exclusions

- Paint supply (sometimes included, sometimes owner-supplied — clarify in scope)
- Wallpaper removal (sometimes painting scope, sometimes demolition)
- Plastering and patching beyond minor fill work
- Feature walls requiring special techniques (limewash, venetian plaster, textured finishes)
- Exterior painting (if scope is interior only)
- Painting areas not being renovated
- Furniture moving
- Colour consulting
- Specialty coatings (anti-graffiti, fire-retardant, acoustic)
- Staining/oiling timber (different product and process)

---

## SECTION 7: Pricing Guidance (For PC Sums)

Ballpark ranges for Australian capital cities:
- Per room (standard bedroom — walls + ceiling) — prep and 2 coats
- Per room (bathroom — above tile, ceiling)
- Per square metre (walls)
- Per square metre (ceiling)
- Per door (both sides, including frame)
- Per linear metre (trim/skirting/architrave)
- Full interior repaint (3-bed home, typical range)
- Renovation-specific painting (new plasterboard, full system)
- Touch-up visit (is this typically included or extra?)

---

## SECTION 8: Homeowner Mistakes & DIY Considerations

- Painting is the most common DIY trade — what's the quality difference between DIY and professional?
- Most common DIY mistakes (insufficient prep, wrong paint type, not enough coats, cutting in poorly)
- When should homeowners NOT DIY paint? (high ceilings, new plasterboard, spray application, wet areas)
- How to spec a painting scope that avoids "I thought that was included" disputes
- Assuming one coat is enough
- Not specifying the number of colours (more colours = more cost)
- Forgetting ceilings in the scope
- Not planning for touch-ups after appliance installation

## Output Format

Organise under each section heading. Note sources and confidence. Painting is a simpler trade but the scope must be precise to avoid disputes.

RESEARCH-painting-surface-preparation.md         → Section 4
RESEARCH-painting-sequencing-coordination.md     → Section 5
RESEARCH-painting-exclusions.md                  → Section 6
