# Research Prompt: Demolition & Strip-Out Trade — Australian Residential Renovations

## Context for the Researcher

I'm building an AI-powered Scope of Works Generator for Australian homeowners planning renovations. The tool generates demolition/strip-out scope documents that homeowners send to demolition contractors (or their builder) for quoting. The scope needs to be detailed enough that the contractor can price accurately, and three contractors would interpret it the same way.

Demolition is typically the FIRST trade on site, so getting this scope right sets the tone for the entire project. The biggest risk here is **asbestos** — getting this wrong has serious health and legal consequences.

## SECTION 1: Australian Demolition Standards & Compliance

Research and document:

- **Asbestos regulations by state** — This is critical. For each state/territory:
  - When is an asbestos inspection mandatory? (property age thresholds — generally pre-1990, but confirm)
  - Who can do the inspection? (licensed asbestos assessor requirements)
  - What licence is needed to remove asbestos? (Class A vs Class B — bonded vs friable)
  - What are the penalties for illegal asbestos removal?
  - Notification requirements (SafeWork, WorkSafe, etc.)
  - Disposal requirements (licensed facilities, transport requirements)
  - Maximum quantity a homeowner can legally remove themselves (if any — varies by state)
- **Work Health & Safety Act** — Key requirements for demolition in residential settings
- **SafeWork/WorkSafe guidelines** — Demolition code of practice for residential work
- **Council requirements** — When does internal demolition require a council permit? (generally internal reno doesn't, but confirm for each state)
- **Noise regulations** — Permitted demolition hours by state/council (typically 7am-5pm weekdays?)
- **Waste disposal regulations** — Skip bin rules, hazardous waste separation, tip fees for asbestos
- **Heritage considerations** — What additional constraints apply to heritage-listed properties during demolition?
- **Structural safety during demolition** — When is a temporary propping/shoring plan needed? Who prepares it?

## SECTION 2: Demolition Scope Items by Room Type

For EACH room type, provide a comprehensive list of demolition items. For each item include:
- What it involves
- Typical method
- Whether it's standard or conditional
- Safety/compliance requirements
- What's commonly forgotten

### Room Types:

**A. Kitchen Strip-Out**
- Cabinet removal (base, overhead, pantry, island)
- Benchtop removal (laminate vs stone — different methods/costs)
- Splashback removal (tiles, glass, stone — substrate damage implications)
- Flooring removal (vinyl, tiles — by layer, down to slab or subfloor)
- Appliance disconnection and removal (who disconnects gas? who disconnects electrical? plumber or sparky must do this)
- Sink and tapware removal
- Wall removal (non-load-bearing vs load-bearing — load-bearing needs engineer + propping)
- Ceiling removal/modification (bulkheads, soffits)
- Service disconnection (electrical, plumbing, gas — MUST be done by licensed trades)
- Asbestos-containing items commonly found in kitchens (vinyl flooring, fibro backing, textured ceilings, pipe lagging)

**B. Bathroom Strip-Out**
- Tile removal (walls and floor — down to substrate or full substrate removal?)
- Waterproofing removal (old membrane must come off for new waterproofing?)
- Fixture removal (toilet, vanity, bath, shower screen)
- Shower hob/base removal
- Ceiling removal (if applicable)
- Service disconnection
- Common asbestos locations in bathrooms (fibro walls, vinyl flooring, tile adhesive in pre-1990 homes)

**C. Laundry Strip-Out**
- Cabinet and benchtop removal
- Tub removal
- Flooring removal
- Service disconnection

**D. Living Areas**
- Wall removal (load-bearing assessment critical)
- Flooring removal (carpet, timber, tiles)
- Ceiling removal
- Built-in furniture/shelving removal

**E. Outdoor / Deck**
- Deck demolition (timber deck removal, concrete patio removal)
- Pergola/shade structure removal
- Retaining wall removal
- Garden bed/landscaping removal
- Concrete path removal

**F. General / Whole Home**
- Skip bin sizing guide (what size for what project: 3m³, 4m³, 6m³, 8m³)
- Site protection (dust barriers, floor protection, door protection, stair protection)
- Temporary services (temporary power, temporary water if mains disconnected)
- Rubbish removal and tip fees
- Disconnection of services (who does what — electrician for power, plumber for water/gas)

## SECTION 3: Asbestos — The Critical Knowledge

This deserves its own section because it's the #1 risk in Australian renovation demolition.

Research:
- **Where is asbestos commonly found in Australian homes by era?**
  - Pre-1960 homes
  - 1960-1980 homes (peak asbestos use)
  - 1980-1990 homes
  - Post-1990 (generally safe, but not guaranteed)
- **Common asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) by room:**
  - Fibro sheeting (eaves, walls, wet area linings)
  - Vinyl floor tiles and adhesive
  - Textured/stipple ceilings (not all are asbestos — how to tell?)
  - Pipe lagging and insulation
  - Behind tiles (asbestos cement sheet as tile substrate)
  - Electrical backing boards (meter boards, switchboard backing)
  - Roof materials (not typically part of interior reno, but note)
- **Asbestos testing process** — What does it involve? Cost? Timeline? Who does it?
- **Asbestos removal process** — What does a licensed removal involve? Setup, containment, air monitoring, clearance certificate
- **Cost ranges for asbestos removal** — Ballpark for common scenarios (fibro bathroom walls, vinyl flooring, small quantity bonded removal)
- **What happens if asbestos is found DURING demolition?** — Stop work procedure, notification requirements, remediation process

## SECTION 4: Structural Demolition

Research:
- **Load-bearing wall identification** — How can homeowners get an indication? (engineer assessment always needed for certainty)
- **Structural engineer requirements** — When is an engineer needed? What do they provide? (beam design, propping plan) Typical cost?
- **Temporary propping** — What is it? When needed? Who provides it?
- **Steel beam installation** — Common when removing load-bearing walls. Scope items involved (beam supply, installation, posts, connections, building certification)
- **Council approval for structural work** — When is a DA or CDC required for internal wall removal?
- **Building certification** — Who inspects structural work? When?

---

## SECTION 5: Sequencing & Coordination

- **What must happen BEFORE demolition starts?** (asbestos clearance, service disconnection, council approvals, structural engineer sign-off, skip bin delivery)
- **What trades are needed DURING demolition?** (electrician to disconnect, plumber to disconnect and cap, gas fitter)
- **What happens AFTER demolition?** (structural work, rough-in can begin)
- **Site protection requirements** — What needs protecting? How?
- **Dust and noise management** — Practical measures

---

## SECTION 6: Common Exclusions

- Asbestos testing and removal (usually separate quote)
- Structural engineering fees
- Council/certification fees
- Service disconnection (by licensed electrician/plumber — separate quotes)
- Temporary propping and structural steel
- Making good to adjacent areas
- Pest treatment (if termite damage discovered)
- Remediation of water damage or mould (if discovered)

---

## SECTION 7: Pricing Guidance (For PC Sums)

Ballpark ranges for Australian capital cities:
- Kitchen strip-out (complete, no asbestos)
- Bathroom strip-out (complete, no asbestos)
- Skip bin hire (by size — 3m³ to 8m³)
- Asbestos inspection cost
- Bonded asbestos removal (small quantity — e.g., bathroom fibro)
- Non-load-bearing wall removal
- Load-bearing wall removal (including beam, excluding engineer)
- Structural engineer assessment

---

## SECTION 8: Homeowner Mistakes & Red Flags

- Homeowners who attempt demolition without asbestos check
- Assuming all walls are non-load-bearing
- Underestimating skip bin size
- Forgetting site protection (damaging floors/stairs during demo)
- Not disconnecting services before demo starts
- DIY demolition — what's safe to DIY and what's not?
- Disposing of asbestos illegally (tip won't accept it without proper wrapping/labelling)

## Output Format

Organise under each section heading. Note sources and confidence level. Present state-specific differences in table format where applicable.

I need this research to be thorough enough that I can write a system prompt for an AI that generates professional demolition scopes for Australian residential renovations.
