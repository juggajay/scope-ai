# Research Prompt: Tiling Trade — Australian Residential Renovations

## Context for the Researcher

I'm building an AI-powered Scope of Works Generator for Australian homeowners planning renovations. The tool generates professional tiling scope documents. Tiling scopes need clear specifications because tile selection massively affects cost, and the labour component varies significantly based on tile size, pattern, and substrate.

---

## SECTION 1: Australian Tiling Standards & Compliance

Research and document:

- **AS 3958.1 — Guide to the Installation of Ceramic Tiles** — Key requirements affecting scope (substrate preparation, adhesive selection, movement joints, wet area requirements)
- **AS 3740 — Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas** — How does this interact with tiling? (waterproofing must be done BEFORE tiling in wet areas — what are the requirements?)
- **Licensing requirements by state** — Is a tiling licence required? Or just waterproofing? Can a tiler do waterproofing or must it be separate?
- **Waterproofing certification** — Who issues it? When? What does the tiler need to verify before tiling over waterproofing?
- **Slip resistance requirements** — AS 4586 ratings (R10, R11, etc., P ratings for wet areas). What ratings are required where? (bathroom floors, outdoor, pool surrounds)
- **Movement joints** — When and where are movement joints (expansion joints) required? How does this affect the scope?

## SECTION 2: Tiling Scope Items by Room Type

For each room, provide comprehensive tiling items with specifications:

**A. Kitchen**
- Splashback tiling (area calculation — benchtop to overhead, behind cooktop — usually 600mm height)
- Floor tiling (if applicable)
- Common tile types/sizes for kitchen splashback (subway 75×150, 100×300, large format, mosaics)
- Layout patterns (stack bond, brick bond, herringbone — labour cost differences)
- Grout type (cement vs epoxy — when to use each)
- Edge finishing (where tiles meet benchtop, where tiles meet overhead cabinets)
- Feature tile panels (behind cooktop)
- Window sill tiling

**B. Bathroom**
- Floor tiling (slip resistance requirements, floor waste fall to waste, typical sizes)
- Wall tiling (full height vs half height, shower area vs general walls)
- Shower floor (small format for fall, mosaic sheets, linear drain implications)
- Shower niche tiling (internal surfaces, bullnose or mitred edges)
- Shower hob/curb tiling
- Bath surround tiling
- Feature wall tiling (accent tiles, different size/pattern/material)
- Tile-insert floor waste grates
- Common tile sizes for bathroom floors (300×300, 600×600, hexagonal, penny round)
- Common tile sizes for bathroom walls (300×600, 600×600, large format, subway)

**C. Laundry**
- Floor tiling
- Splashback tiling
- Wall tiling (if applicable)

**D. Living Areas**
- Floor tiling (large format 600×600, 600×1200, 800×800)
- Porcelain vs ceramic — what's the difference for scope?
- Rectified vs non-rectified tiles (grout joint size implications)
- Heating mat compatibility (if underfloor heating)

**E. Outdoor**
- Patio/alfresco tiling (external-rated tiles, frost resistance if relevant)
- Pool surround tiling (slip resistance, salt resistance)
- Step/stair tiling (bullnose, anti-slip nosing)
- Balcony tiling (waterproofing and drainage requirements)
- Porcelain pavers (20mm thick, pedestal system vs adhesive)

## SECTION 3: Substrate Preparation

This is where most tiling problems start. Research:

- **Cement sheet (fibre cement)** — When required? What thickness? How is it fixed?
- **Existing tiles** — Can you tile over tiles? When? When not? (height build-up, adhesion issues)
- **Plasterboard** — Can you tile on plasterboard? When? (light tiles only, moisture-resistant in wet areas)
- **Concrete slab** — Preparation requirements (grinding, levelling, priming)
- **Timber floors** — Can you tile on timber? What substrate is needed? (cement sheet overlay, decoupling membrane like Ditra)
- **Levelling compound** — When needed? What types? Self-levelling vs feather finish? Cost implications?
- **Waterproofing membrane** — The tiler tiles OVER the membrane. What must the tiler check/verify before starting?
- **Screed** — When is a screed required? (shower floors for fall, floor levelling)

---

## SECTION 4: Adhesive, Grout & Materials

Research specifications for scope:

- **Tile adhesive types** — When to use what:
  - Standard cement-based adhesive
  - Flexible/modified adhesive (for large format, underfloor heating)
  - Rapid-set adhesive
  - Epoxy adhesive (when needed?)
- **Grout types:**
  - Cement-based grout (standard, sanded vs unsanded)
  - Epoxy grout (when recommended — wet areas, splashbacks, stain resistance)
  - Grout colours (selection process — owner to confirm)
- **Silicone/sealant** — Where required? (all internal corners, wall-to-floor junctions, around fixtures). Colour-matched? Mould-resistant?
- **Tile sealing** — Which tiles need sealing? (natural stone — marble, travertine, limestone. Unglazed porcelain. Cement tiles). Penetrating sealer vs topical sealer?
- **Waterproofing membrane** (if tiler is doing it) — Types, brands (Ardex, Mapei, Laticrete), application methods (liquid vs sheet)

---

## SECTION 5: Sequencing & Coordination

- **When does tiling happen in the renovation sequence?**
  - After waterproofing (wet areas) — who inspects waterproofing before tiling?
  - Floor tiling: before or after cabinetry? (both approaches — pros/cons)
  - Splashback tiling: AFTER cabinets, BEFORE benchtop
  - Wall tiling: after plumbing/electrical rough-in, after waterproofing
- **Coordination with:**
  - Waterproofer: tiling can't start until waterproofing is certified
  - Plumber: floor waste position, shower mixer position, niche position
  - Electrician: floor heating mat installation (before tiling), niche lighting
  - Cabinet maker: splashback height dependent on cabinet height
  - Stone mason: splashback meets benchtop — which goes first?
  - Painter: tiling happens before final paint

## SECTION 6: Common Exclusions

- Tile supply (usually owner-selected — PC sum in scope)
- Waterproofing (often separate trade/quote)
- Substrate preparation beyond normal (e.g., slab grinding, structural repairs)
- Heated flooring supply and install (electrical trade, but tiler tiles over it)
- Tile sealing (sometimes included, sometimes not — clarify in scope)
- Removing existing tiles (sometimes demolition scope)
- Floor levelling compound (sometimes included, sometimes additional)
- Feature tile inserts/borders (additional labour)
- Cut-outs for floor wastes, fixtures

---

## SECTION 7: Pricing Guidance (For PC Sums)

Ballpark ranges for Australian capital cities:
- Tiling labour rate per m² (standard size — 300×600, 600×600)
- Tiling labour rate per m² (large format — 600×1200+)
- Tiling labour rate per m² (small format / mosaic)
- Tiling labour rate per m² (herringbone/complex pattern)
- Splashback tiling per m² (supply and labour separately)
- Bathroom floor tiling (typical bathroom size — 4-6m²)
- Bathroom wall tiling (full height, typical bathroom)
- Waterproofing per m² (if tiler provides)
- Floor levelling per m² (if needed)
- Tile supply ranges per m² (budget / mid-range / premium / luxury)
- Epoxy grout premium (additional cost over standard)

---

## SECTION 8: Homeowner Mistakes & Red Flags

- Choosing tiles without checking slip ratings for wet areas/outdoors
- Not understanding tile wastage allowance (10-15% for standard, 15-20% for diagonal/herringbone)
- Assuming grout colour doesn't matter (it massively affects the look)
- Not selecting tiles early enough (some tiles have long lead times, especially imported)
- Choosing very large format tiles for small spaces (more cuts = more waste = more cost)
- Not understanding the cost difference between standard layout and complex patterns
- Forgetting about edge finishing (bullnose tiles, metal trim, mitred edges)
- Assuming the tiler will waterproof (may be separate trade)
