# Deep Research Prompt: Plumbing Trade — Australian Residential Renovations

## Context for the Researcher

I'm building an AI-powered Scope of Works Generator for Australian homeowners planning renovations. The tool generates professional plumbing scope documents that homeowners send to plumbers for quoting. The scope needs to be detailed enough that:

1. A plumber reads it and thinks "this person knows what they want — I can price this accurately"
2. Three different plumbers can quote on identical items, making quotes directly comparable
3. Nothing critical is missed that would cause a variation (cost blowout) later

I need you to research and compile ALL of the following information specifically for **residential plumbing work in Australian renovations**. Focus on practical, real-world knowledge — not textbook theory. I need to know what actually goes into a plumbing scope for each room type.

---

## SECTION 1: Australian Plumbing Standards & Compliance

Research and document:

- **AS/NZS 3500 (Plumbing and Drainage)** — The key requirements that affect residential renovation scopes. Specifically:
  - AS/NZS 3500.0 — Glossary of terms
  - AS/NZS 3500.1 — Water services (pipe sizing, materials, backflow prevention, tempering valves)
  - AS/NZS 3500.2 — Sanitary plumbing and drainage (trap requirements, venting, grades, access points)
  - AS/NZS 3500.4 — Heated water services (tempering valve requirements, TMV vs thermostatic mixing, storage vs instantaneous, heat pump requirements)
- **AS/NZS 3500.5** — Housing installations — what's specific to residential?
- **AS 3740** — Waterproofing of domestic wet areas (overlap with waterproofing trade — note which plumbing items interact with waterproofing)
- **Backflow prevention requirements** — When are backflow devices required? What types? (testable vs non-testable)
- **State-by-state licensing requirements** — What plumbing licence is required in each state/territory? (NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, TAS, NT, ACT)
- **Certificate of Compliance** — What is it called in each state for plumbing? When must it be issued? Is council notification required?
- **Council/water authority notification** — When does plumbing work require notification to council or the water authority (Sydney Water, Melbourne Water, etc.)? What triggers an inspection vs self-certification?
- **Drainage regulations** — When does work require a sewer/stormwater diagram? When does council approval apply?
- **Gas fitting** — Is gas work covered under plumbing licence in each state, or separate? What additional licensing is required? What compliance certificates are needed for gas work?
- **Hot water system regulations** — Current requirements for tempering valves (max 50°C at bathroom/kitchen outlets), TMV servicing requirements, energy efficiency requirements affecting hot water choices
- **Water efficiency (WELS)** — Do scopes need to reference minimum WELS star ratings for fixtures? Any state-specific water efficiency requirements?

## SECTION 2: Plumbing Scope Items by Room Type

For EACH of the following room types, I need a comprehensive list of every plumbing item/task that could be included in a renovation scope. For each item, include:
- What it is and what it involves
- Typical specifications (pipe sizes, materials, connection types)
- Whether it's standard (included in most renovations) or optional
- Any compliance requirements specific to that item
- Common mistakes or things homeowners forget

### Room Types to Cover:

**A. Kitchen Renovation**
- Sink rough-in (new position vs existing position — difference in scope)
- Sink waste connection (40mm vs 50mm, trap types, AAV vs conventional venting)
- Hot and cold water supply to sink (pipe sizing, isolation valves, materials — copper, PEX, multilayer)
- Dishwasher connection (water supply, waste, isolation valve, air gap/backflow)
- Gas supply for cooktop (if gas — pipe sizing, isolation valve, bayonet fitting, compliance cert)
- Gas to induction/electric changeover (capping gas, what's involved)
- Fridge water connection (for ice maker/water dispenser)
- Waste disposal unit connection
- Island bench plumbing (running services through floor slab — core drilling, implications)
- Under-sink water filter provisions
- Instant boiling water unit (Zip/Billi) — requirements
- Relocating sink waste through floor vs wall

**B. Bathroom Renovation**
- Shower rough-in (mixer position, shower rose height, niche position considerations)
- Shower waste (floor waste grate, position, linear drain vs centre drain, tile insert options)
- Bath rough-in (freestanding vs built-in, spout type — wall vs floor mounted, waste position)
- Vanity/basin rough-in (wall-hung vs floor-standing, single vs double, trap types)
- Toilet rough-in (set-out distance from wall, S-trap vs P-trap, concealed cistern vs close-coupled)
- Heated towel rail connection (hydronic vs electric — plumbing scope if hydronic only)
- In-floor heating (hydronic — plumbing scope if hydronic)
- Tempering valve (TMV) installation/relocation
- Floor waste positioning (code requirements — minimum 1 per wet area?)
- Bidet or bidet seat provisions
- Water supply isolation valves (per fixture)
- Ventilation stack requirements (if adding new fixtures)
- Waterproofing coordination (what plumbing must be done BEFORE waterproofing?)

**C. Laundry Renovation**
- Washing machine taps (hot and cold, isolation, height, hose connection type)
- Washing machine waste (standpipe vs floor waste, trap, AAV)
- Laundry tub/sink rough-in
- Dryer provisions (condensate drain if needed)
- Additional taps (garden tap relocation, mop sink)
- Floor waste

**D. Outdoor / Alfresco**
- Outdoor kitchen sink rough-in
- Gas BBQ bayonet connection
- Garden tap relocation or addition
- Outdoor shower
- Pool/spa plumbing (or is this specialist?)
- Rainwater tank connection to fixtures (toilet, laundry, garden)
- Stormwater drainage modifications

**E. Whole Home / General**
- Hot water system replacement/relocation
  - Electric storage → heat pump (what's involved?)
  - Gas storage → gas instantaneous (what changes?)
  - Gas → heat pump (what's involved?)
  - Solar hot water provisions
- Tempering valve installation/replacement
- Main water meter and isolation valve
- Pressure limiting valve (when required?)
- Backflow prevention devices
- Sewer connection modifications (when does this get complicated?)
- Stormwater modifications (deck drainage, new downpipes)
- Gas meter relocation considerations
- Replacing old galvanised/copper pipes with PEX or multilayer

## SECTION 3: Pipe Materials & Specifications

Research the common pipe materials used in Australian residential plumbing and when each is appropriate:

- **Copper** — When still used, sizes, advantages/disadvantages in renovation context
- **PEX (cross-linked polyethylene)** — Types (PEX-A, PEX-B), sizes, when used, connection methods (crimp, expansion)
- **Multilayer (PEX-AL-PEX)** — When preferred over PEX, advantages for renovation
- **PVC/uPVC** — Drainage only? Sizes, grades
- **HDPE** — When used in residential
- **Gas piping** — Copper, PE (polyethylene), what's approved for internal vs external

For each: typical sizes used in residential (e.g., 15mm for hot/cold supply, 50mm for kitchen waste, 100mm for sewer, etc.)

## SECTION 4: Hot Water Systems — Decision Matrix

This is a common renovation decision point. Research:

- **Types available in Australia:**
  - Electric storage (what sizes, where they can go, circuit requirements)
  - Gas storage (continuous flow vs storage, flue requirements, clearance requirements)
  - Gas instantaneous (Rinnai, Bosch — installation requirements, minimum flow rates)
  - Heat pump (noise requirements, positioning, clearances, efficiency ratings, rebate eligibility)
  - Solar (boosted electric vs boosted gas, roof requirements)
- **When does a renovation trigger a hot water upgrade?** (age, insufficient capacity, fuel switching)
- **Rebates and incentives** — Current state/federal rebates for heat pump or solar HW
- **Tempering valve requirements** — What outlets need tempering? What temperature? TMV vs thermostat?
- **Scope implications** — What changes when you swap hot water type? (new circuit, new gas line, new water lines, relocated unit, concrete pad, etc.)

---

## SECTION 5: Sequencing & Coordination

Research how plumbing work fits into the renovation timeline:

- **Rough-in (first fix):** What happens? When must it be done? What other trades need to finish first? What inspections are required before walls close?
- **Waterproofing coordination:** What plumbing rough-in must be complete BEFORE waterproofing? What happens if the sequence is wrong?
- **Stack work / drainage modifications:** When does this happen? How does it affect other trades?
- **Second fix (fit-off):** When? What needs to happen first? (benchtop installed for sink, tiles done for shower, etc.)
- **Final fix:** What's included? Gas connection, appliance commissioning?
- **Coordination with other trades:**
  - Electrician: shared service routes, hot water system wiring, hydronic heating
  - Tiler: timing relative to waterproofing and tile installation
  - Cabinet maker: sink cut-out positioning, dishwasher connections
  - Stone mason: undermount sink positioning, tap hole locations
  - Builder/carpenter: floor penetrations, service chases, access panels

## SECTION 6: Common Exclusions & Assumptions

What items are typically EXCLUDED from a plumbing scope?

- Fixtures/fittings supply (taps, sinks, toilets, shower mixers — usually owner-selected)
- Appliance supply (dishwasher, hot water system if owner-supplied)
- Waterproofing (separate trade in most cases)
- Tiling (obviously, but homeowners sometimes assume "bathroom plumbing" includes tile repair)
- Core drilling through concrete slab (sometimes included, sometimes separate)
- Council/water authority fees
- Asbestos-related costs (old pipe lagging, fibro walls)
- Structural modifications (removing concrete to access drains)
- Sewer line repair/replacement (if found to be damaged during work)
- Making good (patching walls/floors after plumbing chases)
- What does "supply and install" vs "install only (owner supplied)" vs "rough-in only" mean?

## SECTION 7: Pricing Guidance (For PC Sums Only)

Realistic ballpark ranges for Australian capital cities:

- Rough-in per point (water supply point, waste point)
- Toilet supply and rough-in (S-trap vs P-trap, concealed cistern)
- Shower mixer and waste rough-in
- Kitchen sink rough-in (same position vs relocated)
- Island bench plumbing (floor penetration)
- Dishwasher connection
- Gas cooktop connection (new bayonet)
- Hot water system replacement (like for like vs changeover type)
- Heat pump hot water supply and install
- Tempering valve supply and install
- Sewer/drainage modification (minor vs major)
- Full bathroom plumbing rough-in (typical range)
- Full kitchen plumbing rough-in (typical range)

## SECTION 8: Homeowner Mistakes & Red Flags

- Most common items homeowners forget in plumbing scope
- Things homeowners assume are cheap but are expensive (e.g., moving a toilet)
- Common plumbing items that cause variations
- Red flags in a plumber's quote (what's missing?)
- How to tell if a quote is too cheap
- Future-proofing items to consider now (e.g., stub out for future dishwasher, provision for outdoor kitchen)
- The "it's just moving a pipe" misconception — explain what's actually involved

---

## SECTION 9: Real-World Scope Language

Research the format and language plumbers expect to see in a scope:
- How are plumbing items typically described in professional scopes?
- What level of specification is appropriate?
- How are rough-in vs fit-off items distinguished?
- Examples of well-written plumbing scope line items
- How are allowances/PC sums handled for owner-selected fixtures?

## Output Format

Please organise your research under each section heading above. For each piece of information, note:
- The source (so I can verify)
- How confident you are in the accuracy
- Any state-specific variations I need to account for

Where there are state-by-state differences, present them in table format.

I need this research to be thorough enough that I can write a system prompt for an AI that generates professional, tradie-ready plumbing scopes for Australian residential renovations.
