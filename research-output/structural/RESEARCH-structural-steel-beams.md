## SECTION 4: Steel Beam Basics

Homeowners hear "you need a steel beam" from their engineer and often have no idea what that means practically -- how big, how heavy, how it gets into the house, what it costs, and whether there are alternatives. This section provides the reference data ScopeAI needs to explain structural beam work in plain language.

### 4.1 Common Beam Types in Australian Residential Construction

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian steel suppliers (Edcon Steel, Steel Builders, Steel Mart, Southern Steel), Australian Steel Institute publications, and NCC 2022 Volume Two.

---

#### 4.1.1 Universal Beam (UB)

**What it is:** An I-shaped (or H-shaped) steel beam -- the classic "steel beam" most people picture. The cross-section looks like a capital "I" with a vertical web connecting two horizontal flanges. Called "Universal Beam" because the section is standardised across Australian and international manufacturers.

**Australian Standard:** Manufactured to AS/NZS 3679.1 (Hot-rolled structural steel bars and sections), Grade 300 or Grade 300PLUS.

**Common residential sizes:**

| Designation | Depth (mm) | Flange Width (mm) | Web Thickness (mm) | Weight (kg/m) | Common Residential Use |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 150UB14 | 150 | 75 | 5.0 | 14.0 | Small lintels, light loads, short spans. Lightest structural UB |
| 150UB18 | 155 | 75 | 6.0 | 18.0 | Lintels over windows/doors in load-bearing walls |
| 200UB18 | 198 | 99 | 4.5 | 18.2 | Moderate residential spans (3-4m). Very common in home renovations |
| 200UB25 | 203 | 133 | 5.8 | 25.4 | Popular for kitchen-to-living wall removals. Good strength-to-depth ratio |
| 200UB30 | 207 | 134 | 6.3 | 29.8 | Heavier variant for longer spans or greater loads |
| 250UB26 | 248 | 124 | 5.0 | 25.7 | Wider spans (4-5m). Common for open-plan living conversions |
| 250UB31 | 252 | 146 | 6.1 | 31.4 | Standard choice for significant wall removals |
| 250UB37 | 256 | 146 | 6.4 | 37.3 | Heavier loads, longer spans, or two-storey homes |
| 310UB32 | 298 | 149 | 5.5 | 32.0 | Large open-plan renovations, upper floor loads |
| 310UB40 | 304 | 165 | 6.1 | 40.4 | Heavy residential / two-storey with significant roof + floor loads |
| 310UB46 | 307 | 166 | 6.7 | 46.2 | Near the upper end of typical residential use |

**Key points for homeowners:**
- The designation "200UB25" means: 200mm deep, Universal Beam, 25.4 kg per metre
- 200UB and 250UB sizes cover the vast majority of residential wall removal scenarios
- 310UB is used for longer spans (5m+) or heavier loads (two-storey homes, supporting concrete upper floor)
- Beams deeper than 310mm are uncommon in residential renovations
- Standard stock lengths are 9m, 12m, 15m, and 18m -- cut to the required length by the supplier

#### 4.1.2 Parallel Flange Channel (PFC)

**What it is:** A C-shaped steel section (like a UB cut in half lengthwise). Has one flat back face and two flanges projecting from the same side. Often called a "channel" or "C-channel."

**Australian Standard:** AS/NZS 3679.1, Grade 300PLUS.

**Common residential sizes:**

| Designation | Depth (mm) | Flange Width (mm) | Web Thickness (mm) | Weight (kg/m) | Common Residential Use |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 75PFC | 75 | 40 | 3.8 | 5.92 | Light lintels, non-load-bearing applications |
| 100PFC | 100 | 50 | 4.0 | 8.33 | Small window lintels |
| 125PFC | 125 | 65 | 4.0 | 11.9 | Window and door lintels in light-load walls |
| 150PFC | 150 | 75 | 5.0 | 17.7 | Standard lintels over doorways and windows |
| 200PFC | 200 | 75 | 6.0 | 22.9 | Bearer or lintel supporting floor or roof loads over a single span |
| 250PFC | 250 | 90 | 7.0 | 35.5 | Heavier lintels, short-to-medium span beams |
| 300PFC | 300 | 90 | 8.0 | 40.1 | Heavy lintels, combined with other sections |

**When PFC is used instead of UB:**
- Lintels over windows and doors (single PFC or back-to-back PFCs)
- Where beam depth must be minimised (PFC is shallower than equivalent-strength UB)
- As bearers in subfloor framing (supporting floor joists)
- Where the flat back face needs to sit flush against a wall or another element
- Back-to-back PFCs (bolted together as a pair) can replace a UB in some applications

**Key points for homeowners:**
- PFCs are very common for lintels (the beam above a window or door)
- They are generally less expensive per metre than equivalent UBs
- A single PFC is weaker than a UB of the same depth -- for heavier loads, UBs are preferred
- Back-to-back PFCs (e.g., 2x 200PFC) are sometimes used where a UB would be difficult to fit

#### 4.1.3 Square / Rectangular Hollow Section (SHS / RHS)

**What it is:** A hollow tube with a square or rectangular cross-section. Strong in compression, used primarily as posts/columns in residential renovation, though occasionally as beams for short spans.

**Australian Standard:** AS/NZS 1163 (Cold-formed structural steel hollow sections), Grades C250L0 and C350L0.

**Common residential sizes:**

| Designation | Dimensions (mm) | Wall Thickness (mm) | Weight (kg/m) | Common Residential Use |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 65x65x3 SHS | 65 x 65 | 3.0 | 5.62 | Light posts, balustrade supports |
| 75x75x3 SHS | 75 x 75 | 3.0 | 6.55 | Posts for light beam loads |
| 89x89x3.5 SHS | 89 x 89 | 3.5 | 9.09 | Standard residential posts |
| 100x100x4 SHS | 100 x 100 | 4.0 | 11.8 | Most common post for wall removal beams |
| 100x100x5 SHS | 100 x 100 | 5.0 | 14.4 | Heavier loads |
| 125x125x5 SHS | 125 x 125 | 5.0 | 18.2 | Heavy posts, two-storey |
| 150x150x5 SHS | 150 x 150 | 5.0 | 22.0 | Very heavy loads, commercial-residential crossover |
| 150x100x5 RHS | 150 x 100 | 5.0 | 18.2 | Where post needs to be slimmer in one direction (within a wall) |

**Key points for homeowners:**
- SHS/RHS are primarily used as POSTS (vertical supports), not beams
- A 100x100 SHS post is the most common residential size -- it can be concealed within a standard wall
- SHS posts can be concealed inside a plasterboard-clad column (adds ~50mm each side for framing + lining)
- A 100x100 SHS post with plasterboard cladding results in a column approximately 200x200mm -- noticeable but not dominating

#### 4.1.4 Lintels (Steel Angles and Flat Bars)

**What it is:** A lintel is any beam that spans across the top of an opening (door, window, servery). In steel construction, lintels are typically equal angles (EA), unequal angles (UA), or flat bars. For heavier loads, PFCs or UBs are used as lintels.

**Common lintel sections:**

| Section | Typical Sizes | Application |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Equal Angle (EA) | 65x65x6, 75x75x6, 90x90x6, 100x100x8, 125x125x10 | Brick veneer lintels (supporting outer leaf of brickwork) |
| Unequal Angle (UA) | 100x75x8, 125x75x10, 150x90x10 | Where different leg lengths suit the wall construction |
| Flat bar | 200x10, 200x12, 250x10 | Simple lintels, often galvanised, for brick veneer |
| PFC | 150PFC, 200PFC | Load-bearing wall lintels |

**NCC Housing Provisions (Volume Two) requirements:**
- Lintels are required for all timber frame openings over 600mm wide
- Lintels are required for all steel frame openings over 900mm wide
- Minimum bearing length: 100mm for spans under 1,000mm; 150mm for spans over 1,000mm
- The vertical leg of an angle lintel must always be uppermost (flange up)

### 4.2 How Are Beams Sized?

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on AS 4100, SkyCiv design guides, and Australian structural engineering practice.

**The homeowner does not choose the beam size.** A licensed structural engineer performs calculations based on:

#### 4.2.1 Key Design Inputs

| Factor | What It Means | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Span | The distance between support points (posts/columns) | 4.2m clear span for a kitchen-to-living opening |
| Tributary width | The width of floor/roof that the beam must support | If the beam supports joists that span 3m each side = 6m tributary width |
| Dead loads | Weight of the structure itself (roof, ceiling, floor, walls above) | Roof tiles + battens + trusses + ceiling = approximately 0.8-1.2 kPa |
| Live loads | Variable loads (people, furniture, storage) | 1.5 kPa for residential floors, 0.25 kPa for accessible roof |
| Wind loads | Lateral loads from wind (affects connections, not usually beam size) | Per AS/NZS 1170.2 for the specific site |
| Load combinations | Factored combinations of dead + live + wind | Per AS/NZS 1170.0 (Structural design actions) |

#### 4.2.2 Design Checks

The engineer checks the beam against three criteria:

| Check | What It Means | Limit |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Bending strength** | Can the beam resist the maximum bending moment without yielding? | Must not exceed the member's design capacity per AS 4100 |
| **Shear strength** | Can the beam resist the vertical forces at the supports? | Usually not the governing criterion for residential beams |
| **Deflection** | How much does the beam sag under load? | Maximum deflection: Span/250 for total load, Span/300 for live load only (per AS 4100). For a 4m span: max 16mm total sag |

#### 4.2.3 Rules of Thumb (Approximate Only)

These are rough guides only -- the engineer performs the actual calculations:

| Span | Typical Beam Size (Single-Storey, Supporting Roof Only) | Typical Beam Size (Two-Storey, Supporting Floor + Roof) |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 2.0 - 3.0m | 150UB14 to 200UB18 | 200UB25 to 250UB26 |
| 3.0 - 4.5m | 200UB18 to 200UB25 | 250UB26 to 250UB37 |
| 4.5 - 6.0m | 250UB26 to 250UB37 | 310UB32 to 310UB46 |
| 6.0 - 8.0m | 310UB32 to 310UB46 | 360UB+ (uncommon in residential) |

*These are indicative only. Actual beam size depends on specific loads, connection details, and the engineer's design approach. NEVER use these to specify a beam without engineering.*

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- The engineer determines the beam size -- not the builder, not the homeowner
- A bigger beam is not always better (it costs more, weighs more, and may not fit in the ceiling space)
- Deflection (sagging) is often the controlling factor, not strength -- beams are sized to prevent visible sagging
- The engineer provides drawings showing: beam size, connection details, post sizes, footing requirements

### 4.3 Beam Delivery and Site Access

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian steel suppliers (Edcon Steel, Hangan Steel, Cedar Steel) and practical renovation experience.

Getting a steel beam into a house is often the hardest part of the job. Homeowners rarely think about this until the beam arrives.

#### 4.3.1 Will the Beam Fit Through the House?

| Beam Size | Beam Depth | Beam Width | Fits Through Standard Door (820 x 2040mm)? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| 150UB | 150mm | 75mm | Yes, easily | Can be carried through hallways |
| 200UB | ~200mm | ~133mm | Yes | Fits through most internal passages |
| 250UB | ~250mm | ~146mm | Yes | May need to angle around tight corners |
| 310UB | ~300mm | ~165mm | Yes | Width and depth fit, but length is the constraint |

**The main constraint is LENGTH, not cross-section size.** A 5m beam will not navigate a 90-degree turn in a hallway with standard 3.6m clear walls. Options when the beam cannot enter through the building:
- Bring the beam in before internal walls are closed up (sequence the work accordingly)
- Remove a window or door temporarily to pass the beam through an external opening
- Lift the beam over the roof (requires crane)
- Bring the beam in through the roof space (if roof is being opened anyway)

#### 4.3.2 Crane Requirements

| Scenario | Lifting Equipment | Typical Hire Cost |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Beam under 100 kg total weight | Manual handling by 3-4 workers | No crane needed |
| Beam 100-200 kg, ground-floor access | Mini crane (e.g., Maeda 405) or Hiab truck | $500 - $1,500 (half day) |
| Beam 200+ kg, or upper floor / restricted access | Standard mobile crane | $1,000 - $3,000+ (half day) |
| Very tight access (inner-city terrace, steep site) | Specialist mini crane (spider crane) | $1,500 - $4,000 |

**Key logistics considerations:**
- Delivery truck access: steel suppliers deliver on flatbed trucks or Hiab trucks (truck-mounted crane). Ensure the street allows truck access
- Beam storage: beams should not sit on bare ground (moisture). Place on timber dunnage (blocking)
- Coordination: beam delivery should be timed for the day of installation if possible (avoid on-site storage)
- Pre-fabrication: have all holes, plates, and cleats done at the fabrication shop BEFORE delivery to save on-site labour

### 4.4 Surface Treatment and Protection

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian Standards (AS/NZS 2312, AS/NZS 4680), Galvanizers Association of Australia, and Dulux technical data.

#### 4.4.1 Treatment Options

| Treatment | Description | Typical Use | Corrosion Protection | Approximate Cost Premium |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Shop primer (red oxide or zinc-rich) | Thin primer coat applied at steel fabrication shop | INTERNAL beams and posts (most residential work) | Minimal -- intended as temporary protection until painting or concealment | Included in fabrication cost |
| Hot-dip galvanising (HDG) | Steel dipped in molten zinc bath. 70-100 micron zinc coating | EXTERNAL steel, coastal areas, subfloor, retaining walls | Excellent -- 50+ year protection in mild environments | $200 - $500 per tonne |
| Powder coating | Electrostatically applied paint, oven-cured | Exposed architectural steel (posts, beams left visible as a feature) | Good for internal, moderate for external | $300 - $800 per beam (size-dependent) |
| Intumescent paint | Thin film that expands in fire to insulate steel | Fire-rated applications (rarely required for Class 1a residential) | Not for corrosion protection | $500 - $2,000 depending on area |
| Paint system (primer + topcoats) | Multi-coat paint system per AS/NZS 2312 | External or exposed steel with specific aesthetic requirements | Depends on system; 15-25 year life for a 3-coat system in C2 environment | $50 - $150 per beam (internal) |

#### 4.4.2 What Is Typical for Internal Residential?

For a steel beam concealed inside a ceiling bulkhead in a typical Australian home:
- **Shop primer only** is the standard and most common treatment
- The beam is not exposed to weather or moisture, so heavy-duty protection is unnecessary
- The primer prevents surface rust during transport and installation
- Once concealed behind plasterboard, no further coating is needed

For an exposed feature beam (left visible as a design element):
- **Prime and paint** with 2-3 coats of quality enamel or polyurethane
- Or **powder coat** in the factory for a durable, consistent finish (black is most popular)
- Surface preparation is critical: the steel must be clean and properly primed

For external steel (verandah posts, carport beams, subfloor bearers):
- **Hot-dip galvanising** is strongly recommended
- In coastal areas (within 1km of surf coast): HDG is essential
- Consider a duplex system (HDG + paint) for maximum protection (1.5-2.3x the life of either alone)

#### 4.4.3 Relevant Australian Standards

| Standard | Title | Application |

### 4.5 Flitch Beams (Timber + Steel Composite)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Flitch beams are less common in modern Australian residential construction. Information drawn from general structural engineering sources and Australian renovation practice.

#### 4.5.1 What Is a Flitch Beam?

A flitch beam is a composite beam made by sandwiching a steel plate between two timber beams, then bolting the three layers together. The steel provides tensile and compressive strength; the timber provides lateral stability and easy fixing for surrounding framing.

**Construction:**
- Two timber beams (typically hardwood or LVL), e.g., 2x 190x45mm F17 hardwood
- One steel plate (flat bar) in the centre, e.g., 150x10mm or 200x12mm mild steel
- Through-bolted at regular centres (typically 300-450mm) with M12 or M16 bolts
- Bolt washers on both timber faces to spread the load

#### 4.5.2 When Is a Flitch Beam Used Instead of Full Steel?

| Scenario | Flitch Beam Suitable? | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Renovation of heritage/period home | YES | Maintains timber aesthetic while adding strength. Common in Federation and Victorian homes |
| Retrofitting an existing timber beam | YES | Steel plate bolted to existing timber beam to increase capacity without full replacement |
| Light-to-moderate loads, short spans (under 4m) | YES | Cost-effective alternative to steel UB |
| Heavy loads, long spans (over 4.5m) | NO | Full steel UB or LVL is more appropriate |
| Where surrounding framing must be nailed/screwed to the beam | YES | Timber faces allow easy fixing (unlike steel) |
| Where beam must be concealed in ceiling | EITHER | Both flitch and steel can be concealed; choose based on load requirements |

#### 4.5.3 Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-----------|--------------|
| Lighter than full steel beam | Lower strength than equivalent-depth steel UB |
| Easier to handle on site (can be assembled in place) | Requires precise bolt installation |
| Timber faces allow nailing/screwing of framing | Not suitable for heavy loads or long spans |
| Lower material cost for light applications | Susceptible to timber defects (knots, splits) |
| Suitable for heritage renovations | Requires treatment for termite/rot protection |
| Can be retrofitted to strengthen existing timber beams | Less commonly engineered -- may need specialist engineer |

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- Flitch beams are most common in renovations of older timber-framed homes where full steel replacement would be disruptive
- They are rarely used in new construction (LVL or steel is more common)
- The engineer must design the flitch beam -- it is not a DIY modification

### 4.6 LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) -- When Can Engineered Timber Replace Steel?

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian LVL manufacturers (Carter Holt Harvey Futurebuild, Wesbeam), WoodSolutions (FWPA), and LVL span tables.

#### 4.6.1 What Is LVL?

Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) is an engineered wood product made by bonding thin wood veneers together under heat and pressure, with all grain oriented in the same direction (parallel). This produces a strong, dimensionally stable beam that is straighter, more consistent, and stronger than sawn timber.

**Key Australian LVL brands:**
- **hySPAN** (Carter Holt Harvey / Futurebuild) -- the most widely specified LVL in Australia
- **hySPAN+** -- higher-strength variant
- **Wesbeam e-beam** -- Western Australian manufacturer
- **Dindas** -- Victorian manufacturer

#### 4.6.2 Common LVL Sizes for Residential Beams

| Size (Depth x Width mm) | Approximate Weight (kg/m) | Common Application |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 150 x 45 | 3.4 | Small lintels, light loads |
| 200 x 45 | 4.5 | Window/door lintels |
| 200 x 63 | 6.3 | Standard lintels, light bearers |
| 240 x 45 | 5.4 | Floor joists, rafters |
| 240 x 63 | 7.6 | Bearers, beams |
| 300 x 63 | 9.5 | Medium-span beams |
| 360 x 63 | 11.3 | Longer span beams |
| 360 x 75 | 13.5 | Heavy beams, longer spans |
| 400 x 63 | 12.6 | Near maximum for standard LVL |
| 400 x 75 | 15.0 | Heavy beams |
| 480 x 75 | 18.0 | Long spans, heavy loads |
| 525 x 75 | 19.7 | Maximum standard residential LVL beam |

*LVL can be ordered from 90x36mm up to 525x75mm, and up to 12 metres long.*

#### 4.6.3 When Can LVL Replace Steel?

| Scenario | LVL Suitable? | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Single-storey home, supporting roof only, span under 5m | OFTEN YES | LVL is frequently specified instead of steel for these applications |
| Single-storey, span under 4m, light load | YES | LVL is often the most cost-effective solution |
| Two-storey home, supporting floor + roof | SOMETIMES | Depends on specific loads. LVL may need to be very deep (400mm+) |
| Span over 6m | UNLIKELY | Steel is usually more practical (LVL becomes very deep) |
| Exposed beam (visible feature) | YES | LVL has a clean timber appearance, can be stained/oiled |
| Bathroom/laundry (moisture exposure) | CAUTION | LVL must be H2 or H3 treated if exposed to moisture. Generally steel preferred |
| Subfloor / outdoor | NO (unless treated) | Requires H3 or H4 treatment for ground contact / weather exposure |

#### 4.6.4 LVL vs Steel Comparison

| Factor | LVL | Steel (UB) |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Weight | Much lighter (5-20 kg/m for residential sizes) | Heavier (14-46 kg/m for residential sizes) |
| Handling | Can be carried by 1-2 workers for most sizes | May require crane for larger sizes |
| Fixing | Easy -- can be nailed, screwed, bolted | Requires bolting, welding, or proprietary connectors |
| Cost (supply) | Generally cheaper for equivalent performance in light-medium loads | Cheaper per unit of strength for heavy loads |
| Beam depth | Deeper than steel for equivalent load capacity | Shallower section for same load capacity |
| Termite risk | Susceptible (must be treated in termite areas) | No termite risk |
| Moisture tolerance | Poor unless treated | Needs corrosion protection but tolerate better |
| Fire performance | Chars predictably (can be fire-designed) | Loses strength rapidly at high temperatures (but often not relevant for Class 1a) |
| Lead time | Available from stock at most timber merchants | May require 1-2 weeks for fabrication |
| Delivery | Can be delivered on standard ute/truck | May require Hiab or flatbed truck |

#### 4.6.5 Approximate LVL Costs (Supply Only)

| Size | Approximate Cost per Metre (ex-GST) | Notes |
|------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| 200 x 45 | $10 - $20/m | Small lintel |
| 240 x 63 | $18 - $30/m | Standard bearer/beam |
| 300 x 63 | $25 - $40/m | Medium beam |
| 360 x 75 | $35 - $55/m | Larger beam |
| 400 x 75 | $45 - $65/m | Heavy beam |
| 480 x 75 | $55 - $80/m | Long span |
| 525 x 75 | $65 - $95/m | Maximum residential size |

*Prices vary significantly by region and supplier. LVL is typically 30-50% cheaper than steel on a supply-only basis for light-to-medium load applications, but the gap narrows for heavy loads where steel is more efficient.*

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- LVL is a fully engineered product -- it is NOT just "big timber." It is manufactured to precise specifications
- The engineer determines whether LVL or steel is appropriate for your project
- LVL is increasingly common in Australian residential construction due to lower cost, easier handling, and sustainability
- LVL can be stained and left exposed as a feature beam (warm timber aesthetic vs industrial steel)
- In termite-prone areas (most of Australia), ensure LVL is treated to at least H2 level

### 4.7 Typical Beam Costs -- Summary Comparison

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Pricing is indicative and fluctuates with market conditions. Based on 2025-2026 Australian market data from multiple sources.

#### 4.7.1 Supply-Only Cost Comparison (Per Metre, ex-GST)

| Beam Type / Size | Approx. Cost per Metre | Weight (kg/m) | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|-------|
| **LVL 200x63** | $15 - $25 | 6.3 | Small lintel / bearer |
| **LVL 300x63** | $25 - $40 | 9.5 | Medium residential beam |
| **LVL 360x75** | $35 - $55 | 13.5 | Larger residential beam |
| **LVL 480x75** | $55 - $80 | 18.0 | Heavy residential beam |
| **150UB14** | $30 - $60 | 14.0 | Lightest steel UB |
| **200UB18** | $45 - $80 | 18.2 | Common residential steel beam |
| **200UB25** | $55 - $100 | 25.4 | Popular for wall removal |
| **250UB26** | $65 - $120 | 25.7 | Open-plan conversion |
| **250UB37** | $80 - $140 | 37.3 | Heavier residential |
| **310UB32** | $90 - $160 | 32.0 | Large residential |
| **310UB46** | $110 - $200 | 46.2 | Heavy residential |
| **200PFC** | $40 - $75 | 22.9 | Standard PFC lintel |
| **250PFC** | $55 - $100 | 35.5 | Heavy lintel |

*Prices exclude GST, delivery, fabrication (for steel), and installation. Steel prices are based on approximately $2,300-$2,800 per tonne plus standard fabrication. Fabrication (end plates, holes, cleats) adds $200-$800+ per beam.*

#### 4.7.2 Total Installed Cost (Indicative Ranges)

| Scenario | Beam + Posts + Installation | Notes |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| Small lintel (1.5m span, LVL) | $400 - $1,000 | Material + carpenter labour |
| Medium wall removal (3-4m span, single storey, UB) | $2,000 - $5,000 | Beam + posts + connections + installation |
| Large wall removal (5-6m span, single storey, UB) | $4,000 - $8,000 | Larger beam, potentially crane required |
| Complex wall removal (two-storey, new footings, 310UB) | $6,000 - $15,000+ | Heavy beam, crane, new footings, complex connections |

*These figures are for the structural beam component only. Total project cost (including engineer, certifier, demolition, making good, painting) is significantly higher.*

### 4.8 Quick Reference -- What Homeowners Need to Know

This section summarises the key takeaways for homeowners in plain language. ScopeAI can draw from this for user-facing explanations.

#### Common Questions and Answers

**Q: Why do I need a steel beam?**
A: When a load-bearing wall is removed, the weight it was supporting (roof, ceiling, upper floor) needs a new path to the ground. A steel beam spans across the opening and transfers that weight to posts at each end. Without it, the structure above would sag or collapse.

**Q: Can I choose a smaller beam to save money?**
A: No. The beam is sized by a structural engineer based on the specific loads in your home. Using a smaller beam risks structural failure. The engineer's specification is a legal requirement.

**Q: How long does beam installation take?**
A: For a typical single-wall removal in a single-storey home: 1-3 days for the structural work (propping, demolition, beam installation, connections). Making good (patching, plastering, painting) takes additional time.

**Q: Will I see the beam?**
A: That depends on the beam depth and your ceiling height. If the beam fits within the ceiling/floor zone, it can be fully concealed. If it projects below the ceiling line, it will be visible as a bulkhead (a step-down in the ceiling). Typical bulkheads are 150-350mm deep. Some homeowners choose to leave the beam exposed as a design feature.

**Q: Can I use timber instead of steel?**
A: Often yes. Engineered timber (LVL) is suitable for many residential applications and is lighter, cheaper, and easier to work with. Your structural engineer will specify the best material for your situation. For heavy loads or long spans, steel is usually required.

**Q: Do I need council approval?**
A: Yes. All structural modifications in Australian homes require either a Development Application (DA) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC), supported by structural engineering documentation. Work without approval is illegal and can affect your insurance and resale.

**Q: How much does a structural beam typically cost?**
A: For a standard wall removal in a single-storey home (beam, posts, installation, engineer, certifier): expect $6,000 - $15,000 for the structural component. Complex jobs (two-storey, long spans, new footings) can be $15,000 - $35,000+. This does not include demolition, making good, or finishing trades.

**Confidence:** HIGH - Synthesised from all research above.
