# SECTION 8: HOMEOWNER MISTAKES & RED FLAGS

> **Note for AI System:** Use this section to proactively warn homeowners about common pitfalls in their scope documents. When generating structural scopes, include relevant warnings as "Important Notes" or "Homeowner Advisory" items. The goal is to help homeowners make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes -- not to scare them away from renovation.

## 8.1 Assuming a Wall Is Non-Load-Bearing Without Engineering Assessment

**Confidence:** HIGH (universally cited as the #1 structural mistake across all Australian sources)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Homeowners see a thin internal wall that "looks like just a partition" and assume it serves no structural purpose. They may have read online guides about "knocking on the wall" or "checking the direction of floor joists" as DIY methods to determine if a wall is load-bearing. Some walls appear to be simple plasterboard partitions but are in fact carrying roof loads, supporting ceiling joists, or bracing the structure against lateral forces. In older Australian homes (pre-1960s), framing layouts can be especially unpredictable.

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Structural collapse.** Removing a load-bearing wall without adequate temporary support can cause the roof, ceiling, or upper floor to sag, crack, or in extreme cases collapse. This is a genuine life-safety risk.
- **Progressive cracking.** Even partial removal or weakening of a load-bearing wall can cause cracking in ceilings, walls, and cornices throughout the house as loads redistribute unevenly. This damage may not appear immediately but worsens over weeks and months.
- **Costly emergency repairs.** A homeowner in Perth's Joondanna suburb attempted to remove a kitchen/dining wall without professional input. The wall was load-bearing, and within weeks cracks appeared in the ceiling. Emergency remediation required a structural beam, replastering, and repainting -- costing over three times what a planned removal would have cost.
- **Insurance voidance.** If structural damage results from unpermitted or unengineered work, home insurance policies typically exclude coverage. The homeowner bears the full cost of repairs.
- **Resale complications.** When selling the property, building inspectors will identify evidence of structural modification. Without engineering documentation and council sign-off, buyers will either walk away or demand significant price reductions.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Never assume.** Engage a practising structural engineer to inspect the wall before any demolition. A site inspection and written assessment typically costs $400-$1,200.
2. **Do not rely on online "tests."** Knocking on a wall, checking joist direction, or looking at wall thickness are unreliable indicators. Only an engineer examining the full load path from roof to foundation can confirm whether a wall is structural.
3. **Get it in writing.** The engineer's assessment should be a written report or letter confirming whether the wall is load-bearing, and if so, what support system is required for its removal.

## 8.2 Not Engaging a Structural Engineer Early Enough

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistently cited by Australian builders and engineers)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Homeowners often treat the structural engineer as a late-stage formality -- something you engage "just before demolition starts" to tick a box for council. They may start with an architect or interior designer, develop detailed plans for an open-plan layout, get builder quotes, and only then discover they need engineering. Some homeowners assume their builder will organise the engineer.

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Project delays of 2-6 weeks.** Structural engineers are often booked out, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. Last-minute engagement means waiting for availability, then waiting for drawings to be produced and reviewed. The builder's team sits idle (or goes to another job), and the project timeline blows out.
- **Design rework.** The engineer may determine that the proposed opening requires a deeper beam than expected, meaning the architect's design needs to accommodate a bulkhead. Or post locations conflict with the kitchen layout. Late engineering input forces costly redesign of already-finalised plans.
- **Budget surprises.** If the engineer specifies a 310UB beam (300mm deep) instead of the 200UB (200mm deep) the homeowner assumed, the steel cost doubles, the fabrication is more complex, and larger footings may be needed. Discovering this after the builder's quote has been accepted creates awkward renegotiations.
- **Permit delays.** Council or CDC applications cannot proceed without stamped engineering drawings. Late engineering = late application = late approval = late start.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Engage the structural engineer at the design stage** -- ideally at the same time as (or even before) engaging an architect or designer.
2. **Brief the engineer on the full scope** of intended changes so they can advise on feasibility, beam sizes, and post locations early enough to influence the design.
3. **Ask the engineer for preliminary advice** (beam depth estimates, likely post locations) before finalising kitchen or bathroom layouts.
4. **Factor the engineer's timeline into the project schedule:** allow 2-4 weeks for drawings after the site visit, plus time for any revisions.

## 8.3 Not Understanding That Beam Size Affects Ceiling Height

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented in engineering and renovation literature)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Homeowners envision a wall being removed and replaced with a clean, flush opening -- as if the wall simply disappears. They don't realise that a steel beam has physical depth that must go somewhere. When the beam sits below the existing ceiling line (the most common and cheapest installation method), it creates a bulkhead (a visible step-down) in the ceiling. Homeowners are often shocked when they see the beam "hanging down" 200-350mm below the ceiling.

### Beam Depths for Common Residential Sizes

| Beam Size | Actual Depth | Approximate Bulkhead Depth (Including Cladding) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 150 UB | 150mm | ~180-200mm below ceiling |
| 200 UB | 198-203mm | ~230-260mm below ceiling |
| 250 UB | 248-256mm | ~280-310mm below ceiling |
| 310 UB | 298-307mm | ~330-370mm below ceiling |

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Aesthetic disappointment.** A 310mm-deep bulkhead across a 2.4m ceiling height (standard Australian residential) leaves only 2.07m of clear height under the beam. This can feel oppressively low, especially in an open-plan space designed to feel spacious.
- **Non-compliance with minimum ceiling heights.** The National Construction Code (NCC/BCA) requires minimum 2.4m ceiling height in habitable rooms and 2.1m in non-habitable rooms. If the beam bulkhead drops the clear height below these minimums, the work may not be certifiable.
- **Costly redesign.** If the homeowner rejects a visible bulkhead after the beam is installed, the only options are expensive: raising the roof (usually impractical for renovations), recessing the beam into the ceiling/floor structure (requires modification to joists and is significantly more expensive), or living with it.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Ask the engineer about beam depth implications at the design stage.** Request that the engineer explore options to minimise beam depth where aesthetics are a priority.
2. **Discuss flush beam options with the engineer.** A beam can sometimes be recessed into the ceiling/floor structure above (a "flush beam" or "concealed beam"), but this requires modifying or replacing ceiling joists and costs significantly more in labour.
3. **Consider LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) beams** where engineering permits. LVL beams can sometimes achieve shallower depths for the same span, though they are wider. The engineer determines whether steel or timber is appropriate.
4. **Factor the bulkhead into the interior design.** A well-designed bulkhead with clean plasterboard cladding, shadow-line cornice, and consistent lighting can look intentional rather than like an afterthought.
5. **Measure your existing ceiling height** and subtract the beam depth to understand the real-world impact before committing.

## 8.4 Not Budgeting for the Full Structural Package

**Confidence:** HIGH (the most common source of budget blowouts in renovation projects)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Homeowners Google "wall removal cost" and see figures like "$1,500-$3,000 for non-load-bearing" or "$3,000-$5,000" and assume that's the total cost. They budget for the demolition and maybe a steel beam, but forget (or don't know about) the full chain of costs: structural engineer assessment, engineering drawings, council or CDC application, construction certificate, building certifier fees, steel supply, steel fabrication (cutting, welding plates), temporary propping, installation labour, new footings for posts, services relocation (electrical/plumbing in the wall), plastering, cornice, painting, and final inspection/certification.

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Budget blowout of 50-200%.** A homeowner who budgets $5,000 for a wall removal may face a real cost of $10,000-$15,000 once all components are included. This creates project stress, forces compromises elsewhere, or stalls the project mid-way.
- **Cutting corners.** When the budget runs out, homeowners may be tempted to skip the final engineering certification, defer the make-good work, or not complete the council process -- all of which create compliance, safety, and resale problems.
- **Sticker shock from the builder.** When the builder provides a fully itemised quote that includes all components, the homeowner may reject it as "too expensive" and shop for a cheaper option, sometimes ending up with an unqualified operator.

### Full Cost Components Homeowners Must Budget For

| Component | Often Forgotten? | Typical Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Structural engineer (assessment + drawings) | Sometimes | $1,200 - $3,000 |
| Structural engineer (final certification) | Often | $400 - $800 |
| Building certifier (CC + inspections) | Often | $700 - $2,500 |
| Steel beam supply | Rarely | $400 - $1,200 |
| Steel fabrication (cutting, plates, priming) | Often | $150 - $500 |
| Temporary propping hire | Sometimes | $150 - $500 |
| Demolition labour + waste | Rarely | $500 - $2,000 |
| Installation labour (beam + posts) | Rarely | $1,000 - $3,000 |
| New footings for posts | Often | $500 - $2,000 per pad |
| Services relocation | Very Often | $0 - $2,000+ |
| Make-good (plaster, cornice, paint) | Often | $500 - $2,000 |
| Council/CDC application fees | Often | $0 - $2,000 |
| Contingency (10-15%) | Very Often | $500 - $2,000 |

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Get a fully itemised quote** from the builder that lists every component above. If items are missing, ask specifically about them.
2. **Get the structural engineer's fee confirmed** before the builder's quote -- the builder usually does not include the engineer's fee.
3. **Budget for the complete package**, not just demolition + steel. A realistic budget for a medium-complexity single-storey wall removal is $8,000-$15,000 all-in.
4. **Add a 10-15% contingency** for unexpected issues (concealed services, asbestos, inadequate existing footings).
5. **Understand that cheap quotes often exclude things.** If a quote seems surprisingly low, check what's NOT included.

## 8.5 Assuming the Builder Will "Figure It Out" Without Engineering Drawings

**Confidence:** HIGH (a major safety and compliance risk)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Some homeowners trust their builder implicitly and believe an experienced builder "knows" what size beam to use without engineering calculations. The builder may reinforce this by saying things like "I've done hundreds of these" or "I know what works." The homeowner wants to save the $1,500-$3,000 engineering fee and trusts the builder's experience. In some cases, the builder genuinely believes they can size the beam based on rules of thumb.

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Under-designed support.** A builder may select a beam that is too small for the actual loads. An experienced builder may get it right 90% of the time for simple cases, but they cannot account for unusual load paths, hip roof point loads, second-storey loads, or concentrated loads from above. An undersized beam will deflect (sag) over time, causing cracking and eventually structural failure.
- **Over-designed support (unnecessary cost).** Conversely, without calculations, a builder may specify a much larger beam than necessary "to be safe." This means a larger bulkhead, higher steel costs, and potentially oversized footings.
- **No certifiable documentation.** Building certifiers require stamped engineering drawings (Form 15 or equivalent) signed by a practising structural engineer. Without these, the certifier cannot issue a construction certificate or approve the work. The project is technically illegal.
- **Insurance invalidation.** If structural work is performed without engineering design and something goes wrong, insurance claims are likely to be denied.
- **Resale problems.** Future buyers (and their building inspectors) will ask for engineering documentation for any visible structural modification. No documentation = reduced property value and difficult sale.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Always engage a structural engineer for any load-bearing modification.** This is non-negotiable for compliance and safety.
2. **Understand that the builder and engineer serve different roles.** The engineer designs the support system; the builder installs it. The builder should not be designing structural elements, and the engineer should not be dictating construction methodology.
3. **Be wary of builders who resist engineering input.** A competent builder welcomes engineering drawings because they provide clear specifications, reduce the builder's liability, and ensure the work is certifiable.
4. **The engineering fee is a small percentage of the total project cost** (typically 10-20%) and provides both safety assurance and legal documentation.

## 8.6 Not Getting Council Approval When Required

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented legal consequences; significant financial and legal risk)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Homeowners rationalise skipping council approval with thoughts like: "It's just an internal wall -- nobody will know," "The neighbours can't see anything different from outside," "Council approval takes too long and costs too much," or "My builder said we don't need it." Some homeowners genuinely don't know that internal structural modifications require building approval. Others know but consider the risk of getting caught to be low.

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

#### Legal Penalties

Under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), penalties for unauthorised building works are severe:

| Penalty Tier | Corporation | Individual |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 (most serious) | Up to $5,000,000 + $50,000/day | Up to $1,000,000 + $10,000/day |
| Tier 2 | Up to $2,000,000 + $20,000/day | Up to $500,000 + $5,000/day |
| Tier 3 | Up to $1,000,000 + $10,000/day | Up to $250,000 + $2,500/day |
| On-the-spot fine | - | $750 - $3,000 |

Other states have comparable penalty regimes. In Victoria, penalties can reach $80,500 for individuals and $402,900 for companies.

#### Enforcement Actions

Councils can issue:
- **Stop Work Orders** -- halting all construction activity immediately
- **Demolish Works Orders** -- requiring the homeowner to reverse the work at their own cost
- **Repair Orders** -- requiring rectification to comply with BCA/NCC
- **Restore Orders** -- returning the property to its pre-modification state

#### Insurance Consequences

- Most home insurance policies explicitly exclude coverage for damage arising from unauthorised building work
- If a structural failure occurs due to unpermitted work, the insurance company may deny the claim entirely
- Owners may be personally liable for injuries or damages to third parties (including tradespeople on site)

#### Property Sale Consequences

- Building inspectors will identify evidence of structural modifications (beam lines, post locations, inconsistent framing)
- Buyers will request engineering documentation and council approvals
- Without documentation, buyers will either negotiate a significant price reduction (often $20,000-$50,000+ to cover the risk of rectification) or walk away entirely
- Conveyancers and solicitors routinely check council records for building approvals
- The vendor may be required to obtain retrospective approval, which is more expensive and complex than obtaining approval upfront

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Always check with your local council** (or a private certifier) whether your proposed structural work requires approval, before starting any work.
2. **Budget for council/certifier fees** as part of the project cost (see Pricing Guidance Section 7.5 and 7.11).
3. **Use the CDC (Complying Development Certificate) pathway** where eligible -- it is faster and often cheaper than a full DA.
4. **Keep all documentation** (engineering drawings, certifier certificates, inspection records, occupation certificate) permanently. You will need these when you sell the property.
5. **If you've already done unpermitted work**, consult a building certifier about retrospective approval. It is more expensive and complex than upfront approval, but it is far better than the alternative of leaving illegal work undocumented.

## 8.7 Removing Propping Before Certification

**Confidence:** HIGH (critical safety issue)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Temporary propping (acrow props supporting the ceiling/structure while the beam is installed) is ugly, inconvenient, and gets in the way. Homeowners -- or sometimes impatient builders -- remove the props as soon as the beam "looks secure" to them, without waiting for the structural engineer or building certifier to inspect and approve the installation. The reasoning is: "The beam is bolted in, the posts are in place -- it's obviously fine."

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Structural failure.** The beam connections may not be complete, adequately tightened, or properly welded. The post base plates may not be properly fixed to the footings. The new footings may not have reached adequate concrete strength (concrete takes 7-28 days to reach full design strength). Removing props prematurely removes the safety net before the permanent system is verified.
- **Beam deflection or displacement.** If the beam is not yet fully connected, removing load from the props can cause the beam to shift, twist, or deflect beyond design limits. This can crack plaster, damage connections, and compromise the long-term structural integrity.
- **Certification refusal.** The building certifier may refuse to approve the work if they discover propping was removed before their inspection. This creates a documentation gap that can delay or prevent the occupation certificate.
- **Voided engineering certification.** The structural engineer's Form 15/16 certification requires them to confirm the work was done in accordance with their design. If they cannot verify the installation before propping was removed, they may refuse to certify.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Propping must remain in place until the structural engineer and/or building certifier has inspected and approved the beam installation.** This is a certified hold point.
2. **Confirm the propping removal timeline with the engineer** before the project starts. Typical sequence: beam installed and connections completed, engineer inspects and certifies, certifier inspects (if required), then and only then are props removed.
3. **If footings are new concrete**, the engineer will specify a minimum curing time (typically 7 days minimum, sometimes 28 days for full strength) before load transfer is permitted.
4. **Include propping hire costs for the full expected duration** in the project budget, including buffer time for inspection scheduling.
5. **Never let a builder remove props "to make the space usable" before sign-off.** The inconvenience of living with acrow props for an extra week is nothing compared to the consequences of premature removal.

## 8.8 DIY Structural Work

**Confidence:** HIGH (illegal in all Australian states and territories)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

In the age of YouTube renovation videos and online tutorials, some homeowners believe they can remove a wall themselves to save money. They may have successfully completed non-structural projects (painting, tiling, basic carpentry) and feel confident in their abilities. The motivation is almost always financial -- saving several thousand dollars in builder's fees. Some homeowners are also "owner-builders" and believe their owner-builder permit covers structural work.

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **It is illegal.** In all Australian states, structural building work requires a licensed builder. State licensing thresholds vary:
  - **NSW:** Licensed builder required for work over $5,000
  - **VIC:** Licensed builder required for domestic work over $5,000
  - **QLD:** Licensed builder required for work over $3,300
  - **WA:** Licensed builder (registered building contractor) required for work over $20,000
  - **SA:** Licensed builder required for work over prescribed thresholds

  Even below these financial thresholds, structural work (load-bearing wall removal, beam installation) typically falls under "specialist building work" or "structural work" categories that require licensing regardless of value.

- **Penalties for unlicensed work.** Fines range from $22,000 (NSW individual) to $200,000+ in some jurisdictions. In Victoria, individual penalties reach $80,500 (500 penalty units) and company penalties reach $402,900.
- **No home warranty insurance.** Home warranty insurance (which protects against major structural defects and incomplete work) is only available when licensed builders perform the work. DIY structural work has zero warranty protection.
- **Personal injury risk.** Structural demolition and beam installation involve heavy materials (a 5m length of 310UB steel weighs approximately 160kg), power tools, working at height (ceiling-level), and the risk of uncontrolled collapse. Without proper training, equipment, and insurance, the risk of serious injury is high.
- **Insurance voidance.** Home insurance will not cover damage caused by unlicensed DIY structural work. If the structure fails and damages the house (or a neighbouring property), the homeowner is personally liable.
- **Contracts with unlicensed builders are unenforceable.** If a homeowner hires an unlicensed person (or a friend/relative) to do structural work and the work is defective, they have very limited legal recourse.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Always use a licensed builder for structural work.** Verify the builder's licence on your state's licence check website:
   - NSW: [NSW Fair Trading Licence Check](https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au)
   - VIC: [VBA Register](https://www.vba.vic.gov.au)
   - QLD: [QBCC Licence Search](https://www.qbcc.qld.gov.au)
   - WA: [Building Commission WA](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au)
   - SA: [Consumer and Business Services SA](https://www.cbs.sa.gov.au)
2. **Understand that owner-builder permits have limitations.** An owner-builder permit does not mean you can do everything yourself -- structural work still requires a licensed tradesperson, and the engineering design still requires a practising structural engineer.
3. **The cost of a licensed builder is the insurance premium for your safety, compliance, and property value.** It is never worth saving $3,000-$5,000 in builder fees at the risk of structural failure, legal penalties, and insurance voidance.

## 8.9 Not Understanding the Difference Between a Quote for the Beam vs. Full Installation

**Confidence:** HIGH (a consistent source of homeowner confusion)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

When homeowners request quotes, they often ask simply: "How much for a steel beam?" or "How much to remove this wall?" The builder or supplier provides a number, and the homeowner assumes that number covers everything. In reality, different quotes may cover vastly different scopes:

- A steel supplier's quote covers material only (no delivery, no fabrication, no installation)
- A builder's quote may include demolition and installation but exclude the engineer, certifier, footings, and make-good
- A "wall removal" quote from a specialist may include demo but not the beam supply or engineering

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Budget under-estimation.** A homeowner who gets a steel beam supply quote of $500 and a demolition quote of $1,500 may think the total cost is $2,000, when the actual all-in cost is $8,000-$12,000.
- **Scope gaps.** When the builder's quote does not include engineering, certifier fees, or make-good, the homeowner discovers these additional costs mid-project -- when they have no leverage to negotiate and no budget to absorb them.
- **Conflicting expectations.** The homeowner expects the builder to "handle everything" while the builder expects the homeowner to arrange the engineer and certifier separately. This leads to delays, confusion, and blame.

### Typical Quote Scope Comparison

| Quote Type | Usually Includes | Usually Excludes |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Steel supplier** | Steel beam material, cutting to length | Delivery (sometimes extra), fabrication, priming, installation, everything else |
| **Fabricator** | Steel supply, cutting, welding plates, priming | Delivery, installation, engineering, certifier, make-good |
| **Wall removal specialist** | Demolition, waste removal, basic beam install | Engineering, certifier, footings, services relocation, make-good |
| **Builder (itemised)** | Demolition, propping, beam install, posts, make-good | Engineering (sometimes), certifier (sometimes), council fees |
| **Builder (full package)** | Everything from demo to make-good | Engineering fees (sometimes), council fees (sometimes) |

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Always request a fully itemised quote** that lists every line item from the component table in Section 8.4. If a builder provides a lump-sum quote, ask them to break it down.
2. **Explicitly ask: "What is NOT included in this quote?"** This forces the builder to disclose exclusions.
3. **Compare quotes on a like-for-like basis.** Add up excluded items to create a true total for each quote.
4. **Get the structural engineer's fee separately** and add it to each builder's quote for a true comparison.
5. **Preference builders who offer a "turn-key" or "full package" service** that includes coordinating the engineer, certifier, and all trades. This simplifies the process and reduces the risk of scope gaps.

## 8.10 Choosing a Builder Who Says "We Don't Need an Engineer"

**Confidence:** HIGH (a major red flag universally recognised by the Australian building industry)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

This builder may be the cheapest quote by a significant margin (because they're excluding the engineering cost), or they may project confidence and experience that makes the homeowner feel reassured. The homeowner wants to trust the builder, and the builder is telling them what they want to hear: "It's straightforward, we've done this before, no need to waste money on an engineer."

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **The work will be illegal.** A building certifier cannot issue a construction certificate without engineering drawings for structural work. Without a CC, the work is unauthorised.
- **The beam may be incorrectly sized.** As discussed in Section 8.5, only a structural engineer can correctly design the support system. An undersized beam will sag over time and can fail. An oversized beam wastes money.
- **No documentation for resale.** Without engineering drawings, there is no record of what was designed and installed. Future buyers will question the structural integrity of the modification.
- **The builder may be unlicensed or uninsured.** Legitimate licensed builders understand the regulatory framework and would never suggest skipping engineering. A builder who dismisses engineering requirements may also be cutting corners elsewhere (insurance, licensing, supervision).
- **Personal liability.** If the builder does the work without engineering and something fails, the homeowner bears the consequences. The builder may disappear, go bankrupt, or deny responsibility.

### Red Flags Checklist

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| "We don't need an engineer" | The builder is either ignorant of requirements or deliberately cutting corners |
| "I've done hundreds of these -- I know what beam to use" | Experience does not replace engineering calculations; every house is different |
| "We can save you a few thousand by skipping the engineer" | They are exposing you to unlimited financial and safety risk to save a small fee |
| "Council will never find out" | Illegal advice; if discovered, you (the homeowner) bear the penalties |
| "My mate is an engineer and he said it's fine" (with no written report) | Verbal assurance has no legal standing; you need stamped drawings |
| No written quote or contract | A sign of an unprofessional operation |
| No licence number on quotes/correspondence | May be unlicensed |
| Cash-only payment, no invoice | Tax evasion and no paper trail for warranty claims |

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **If a builder says "we don't need an engineer," walk away.** This is the single biggest red flag in residential structural work.
2. **Verify the builder's licence** on your state's licence check website before engaging them for any work.
3. **Ask every builder for their approach to engineering and certification.** A good builder will proactively recommend engaging a structural engineer and explain the approval process.
4. **Get at least 3 quotes** from licensed builders. If one quote is dramatically cheaper than the others, investigate why -- it almost always means something is excluded or corners are being cut.
5. **Ask for references** and contact them to verify the builder completed the work with engineering documentation and council sign-off.

## 8.11 Not Understanding Hold Points and Inspection Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH (mandated by legislation in all states)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

Most homeowners have never dealt with building inspections or hold points before. They assume the builder "handles all of that" and don't understand that certain construction stages must be inspected BEFORE work can proceed to the next stage. They may not know that covering up structural work before inspection is a compliance violation, or that the certifier needs to be booked in advance (sometimes days or weeks ahead).

### What Are Hold Points?

A "hold point" is a stage in the construction process where work must STOP until an inspection is completed and approval is given to proceed. For structural work, the key hold points are:

| Hold Point | What Must Be Inspected | When It Must Happen | Who Inspects |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Footing inspection** | New concrete pad/pier excavation, reinforcement, and formwork | BEFORE concrete is poured | Building certifier |
| **Structural steel/framing inspection** | Beam installation, connections, post fixings | BEFORE plasterboard or cladding conceals the steelwork | Building certifier and/or structural engineer |
| **Final inspection** | Completed work, make-good, overall compliance | AFTER all work is finished | Building certifier |

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **If work is concealed before inspection**, the certifier may require the homeowner to remove plasterboard, boxing, or other finishes to expose the structural work for inspection. This adds cost and delay.
- **An Occupation Certificate (OC) cannot be issued** if mandatory inspections were missed. Without an OC, the work is technically not approved for occupation.
- **Missed inspections require remediation documentation.** If an inspection was "unavoidably" missed, the certifier may require statutory declarations, engineering certifications, photographic evidence, and other documentation to verify the work -- which is more expensive and complex than simply booking the inspection on time.
- **The project timeline extends.** If the certifier is not booked in advance, waiting for their availability after work is completed can add days or weeks of delay.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Discuss the inspection schedule with the builder AND certifier** at the start of the project. Confirm which inspections are required and when they need to happen.
2. **The builder should book inspections in advance** -- at least 24-48 hours before the hold point is reached. Many certifiers offer same-day booking for next-business-day visits.
3. **Never allow the builder to cover structural work** (plasterboard over beams, pour concrete over reinforcement) until the relevant inspection is complete and approved.
4. **Take dated photographs** at each hold point as a backup record -- photos of footings before concrete, photos of beam connections before cladding. These can support certification if inspections are delayed.
5. **Understand the inspection sequence:**
   1. Footings excavated and reinforced -- STOP -- certifier inspects -- concrete poured
   2. Beam and posts installed and connected -- STOP -- engineer/certifier inspects -- props removed and make-good begins
   3. All work completed -- STOP -- final inspection -- OC issued

## 8.12 Ignoring Signs of Existing Structural Issues

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented warning signs in Australian building inspection literature)

### Why It Happens (Homeowner's Perspective)

When planning a renovation, homeowners focus on what they want to change, not on the existing condition of the house. They may notice cracks in walls, doors that stick, or uneven floors but attribute these to "the house settling" or "just cosmetic." They proceed with plans to remove a wall without realising that these symptoms indicate existing structural problems that must be addressed before (or during) the renovation.

### Warning Signs of Existing Structural Issues

| Warning Sign | What It May Indicate | Severity |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Diagonal cracks** from door/window corners | Foundation movement, differential settlement | Moderate to Severe |
| **Horizontal cracks** in brickwork or render | Wall bulging, lateral pressure, foundation failure | Severe |
| **Stepped cracks** following mortar joints in brickwork | Foundation settlement | Moderate to Severe |
| **Vertical cracks** in walls | Minor settling or thermal movement (usually less concerning) | Minor to Moderate |
| **Cracks wider than 2-3mm** | Active structural movement requiring investigation | Severe |
| **Doors or windows that stick** | Frame distortion from foundation movement or wall shifting | Moderate |
| **Gaps between walls and ceiling** | Framing has shifted, differential movement | Moderate to Severe |
| **Sagging or uneven floors** | Foundation settlement, deteriorated stumps (older homes), failed bearers | Severe |
| **Sagging roofline** | Degraded roof framing, overloaded roof structure | Severe |
| **Visible wall bulging** (outward bow) | Critical structural compromise; load-bearing capacity exceeded | Severe -- immediate action needed |
| **Evidence of previous patching/repairs** | Ongoing movement not previously resolved | Moderate |
| **Bouncy or springy floors** | Undersized or deteriorated floor joists/bearers | Moderate |
| **Termite damage** (even historic) | May have compromised structural timber framing | Variable -- requires inspection |

### What Can Go Wrong (Consequences)

- **Exacerbating existing problems.** Removing a wall in a house that already has foundation issues can dramatically worsen the structural situation. The wall may have been providing lateral bracing that was compensating for the existing movement.
- **Unexpected costs.** If existing structural issues are discovered during demolition, the project scope expands dramatically. What started as a wall removal may become a foundation repair, restumping, or frame reinforcement project.
- **Engineer redesign.** If the engineer is not made aware of existing issues, their beam design may be based on assumptions about the existing structure that are incorrect. This can require redesign mid-project.
- **Safety risk during construction.** Working on a structurally compromised building is more dangerous. Removing propping or temporary supports in a weakened structure has higher collapse risk.

### What They Should Do Instead (Correct Approach)

1. **Conduct a thorough visual inspection** of the entire house before planning any structural modifications. Look specifically for the warning signs listed above.
2. **Disclose any known issues to the structural engineer** during the initial consultation. Show them the cracks, sticking doors, or uneven floors. This enables them to design the new support with existing conditions in mind.
3. **Consider commissioning a structural inspection report** ($500-$1,500) before starting renovation planning -- especially for older homes (pre-1970s), homes on reactive clay soils, or homes with visible cracking.
4. **Address existing structural issues first.** If the house needs restumping, foundation underpinning, or frame repair, this work should be done before or concurrently with the wall removal -- not after.
5. **Monitor cracks before renovation.** Place crack monitors (available from hardware stores) on concerning cracks for 2-3 months before renovation. If cracks are actively growing, the engineer needs to know this.
6. **In older Australian homes, specifically check for:**
   - **Termite damage** (especially in sub-floor framing) -- arrange a pest inspection
   - **Deteriorated stumps** (timber stumps in pre-1960s homes rot over time) -- check sub-floor
   - **Asbestos** (common in homes built 1940s-1980s) -- arrange testing before any demolition
   - **Inadequate original footings** (older homes may have shallow brick or rubble footings)

## SUMMARY: TOP 5 RULES FOR HOMEOWNERS

For the AI system to include as a summary advisory in scope documents:

1. **Always engage a structural engineer** for any work involving load-bearing walls, new openings, or structural modifications. No exceptions.
2. **Budget for the full package** -- engineer + certifier + steel + fabrication + propping + labour + footings + services + make-good + council. Not just "the beam."
3. **Get council/certifier approval** before starting work. Keep all documentation permanently.
4. **Never allow work to proceed past a hold point** without the required inspection. Footings before concrete; beam connections before plasterboard.
5. **If a builder says "we don't need an engineer" -- get a different builder.** This is the single biggest red flag.
