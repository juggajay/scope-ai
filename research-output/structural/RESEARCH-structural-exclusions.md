## 6.1 Why Exclusions Matter

**Confidence: HIGH**

Ambiguity about inclusions and exclusions is one of the most common sources of building disputes in Australia. According to NSW Fair Trading and VCAT case data, unclear scope definition is a leading cause of homeowner-builder conflict, often resulting in expensive tribunal claims or court proceedings.

Structural work is particularly prone to exclusion disputes because:

1. **Multiple trades overlap** — structural work sits at the intersection of demolition, concrete, carpentry, and engineering
2. **High costs** — structural elements are expensive; a missed exclusion can mean thousands of dollars in unexpected costs
3. **Homeowner assumptions** — homeowners often assume "getting a beam put in" includes everything from engineering to painting, when in reality the structural scope is narrow
4. **Provisional sums** — structural work often involves unknowns (existing conditions, soil type, access) that lead to provisional sums and subsequent cost variations

**Key principle for scope generation:** Every structural scope of works must explicitly list what is INCLUDED and what is EXCLUDED. Vague language like "all associated work" or "make good" must be avoided. Each exclusion should specify which trade or scope it belongs to instead.

## 6.2 Common Exclusions — Detailed Breakdown

### 6.2.1 Structural Engineer Fees

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Design of beam sizes, post locations, connection details, footing specifications, certified drawings |
| **Why it is excluded** | The structural engineer is a separate professional engaged directly by the homeowner or builder. Their design work happens weeks or months before the installer arrives on site. The installer works FROM the engineer's drawings — they do not produce them |
| **Who it belongs to** | Homeowner (direct engagement) or Builder (if managing the project) |
| **Typical cost** | $800 - $5,000+ depending on complexity (see Section 5.2.1 of Sequencing document) |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Homeowner assumes the beam installer will "work it all out" and arrives on site without certified drawings. Work cannot legally proceed, causing delays and the homeowner paying rush fees for engineering |

**What homeowners need to know:** The structural engineer must be engaged BEFORE you get quotes for the physical work. You cannot get an accurate quote for beam installation without the engineer first specifying the beam size, post locations, and connection details. The engineer's drawings are the instruction manual that the installer follows.

**Typical fee ranges (AUD, excl. GST):**

| Engineering Scope | Fee Range |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Single beam design (wall removal, simple span) | $800 - $1,500 |
| Beam + new post footing design | $1,500 - $3,000 |
| Full structural assessment + multi-beam design | $3,000 - $5,000 |
| Complex renovation with multiple structural modifications | $5,000 - $15,000+ |
| Hourly rate (if not fixed fee) | $150 - $300/hr |

### 6.2.2 Council / Certification Fees

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Building permit or Complying Development Certificate (CDC), development application fees, certifier inspection fees |
| **Why it is excluded** | These are regulatory fees paid to government authorities or registered certifiers. They are separate from the physical construction work and are the responsibility of the property owner or their appointed builder |
| **Who it belongs to** | Homeowner or Builder (as principal contractor) |
| **Typical cost** | $1,500 - $8,000+ depending on pathway and state |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Homeowner begins seeking structural quotes without having obtained building approval. The installer arrives to find no approval exists, and work cannot commence. Council fees, certifier fees, and the resulting delay all become unexpected costs |

**Fee comparison by approval pathway:**

| Pathway | Issuing Authority | Typical Fee Range (AUD) | Timeframe |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| CDC (Complying Development Certificate) | Private certifier | $1,500 - $4,000 | 3-10 business days |
| DA + CC (Development Application + Construction Certificate) | Local council | $2,000 - $8,000+ | 4-12 weeks |
| Building Permit (VIC) | Registered building surveyor | $2,000 - $5,000+ | 1-4 weeks |
| Certifier inspection fees (per visit) | Building certifier | $250 - $500 per inspection | Booked in advance |

**State-specific notes:**
- **Victoria:** Building permit fees are calculated as a percentage of building work cost, with a minimum fee. The VBA building permit levy also applies.
- **NSW:** CDC is the preferred pathway for internal structural alterations. It is significantly faster than the DA route.
- **Queensland:** Building approval fees are set by the local council or private certifier. Mandatory inspections at four prescribed stages are included in the approval.

### 6.2.3 Demolition of the Wall

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Removal of the load-bearing wall (or section of wall) that the beam replaces, including wall linings, framing, and debris removal |
| **Why it is excluded** | Demolition is a separate trade with its own licensing, insurance, and waste disposal requirements. The structural installer's scope begins once the wall is removed and the opening is ready for the beam |
| **Who it belongs to** | Demolition contractor or Builder |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $3,000 for single wall removal (depending on wall type, size, and waste disposal) |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Homeowner assumes the beam installer will remove the wall as part of the beam installation. The installer arrives expecting a clear opening and finds an intact wall. Additional cost and delay result |

**What demolition includes vs what structural includes:**

| Task | Demolition Scope | Structural Scope |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Remove wall linings (plasterboard, render) | Yes | No |
| Remove wall framing (studs, nogging) | Yes | No |
| Remove existing lintel or header | Yes (or structural, by agreement) | Sometimes |
| Dispose of demolition waste | Yes | No |
| Install temporary propping | Sometimes (see 6.2.5) | Sometimes |
| Install replacement beam | No | Yes |
| Install support posts | No | Yes |

**Important:** The demolition of a load-bearing wall must be done under supervision, with temporary propping already in place. The demolition contractor and structural installer must agree on the sequence — typically the structural installer supervises the propping installation, then the demolition contractor removes the wall, then the structural installer installs the beam. Some builders and structural installers handle the entire process as a single scope, but this must be explicitly agreed.

### 6.2.4 Asbestos Removal

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Testing for and removal of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) found in walls, ceilings, eaves, or backing materials during demolition |
| **Why it is excluded** | Asbestos removal requires specialist licensing, equipment, and disposal procedures. It is a completely separate trade governed by WHS legislation. Neither the demolition contractor nor the structural installer will handle asbestos unless they hold a specific asbestos removal licence |
| **Who it belongs to** | Licensed asbestos removalist (Class A for friable, Class B for non-friable) |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $5,000+ depending on quantity and type |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Asbestos is discovered during demolition. All work stops. The homeowner faces unexpected costs for testing ($200-$500), removal ($500-$5,000+), and project delays of 1-3 weeks while a licensed removalist is engaged |

**Key Australian regulations:**
- Any home built before **1990** may contain asbestos in wall linings, ceiling sheets, eaves, switchboard backing, floor tiles, or adhesives
- Homes built before **1987** have a high probability of containing asbestos
- **Testing:** You cannot determine if a material contains asbestos by visual inspection alone. Laboratory testing ($50-$100 per sample) is required
- **Removal limits (non-friable asbestos):**
  - Homeowner can remove up to 10m2 of non-friable asbestos themselves (with safety precautions) — but this is strongly discouraged
  - More than 10m2 requires a licensed asbestos removalist
  - Friable asbestos (loose, crumbly) must ALWAYS be removed by a Class A licensed removalist
- **Notification:** In most states, removal of more than 10m2 requires notification to the WHS regulator at least 5 business days before work begins

**Practical advice for homeowners:** If your home was built before 1990, budget $500-$1,000 for asbestos testing before demolition begins. Getting an asbestos audit done early avoids surprises and delays during construction.

### 6.2.5 Temporary Propping

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Supply, installation, and removal of temporary structural supports (Acrow props, Strongboys, timber props) that hold up the structure while the load-bearing element is removed |
| **Why it is sometimes excluded** | Propping responsibility is ambiguous — it sits between the demolition scope, the structural scope, and the builder's general obligations. Different contracts allocate it differently |
| **Who it belongs to** | Builder (most commonly), structural installer (sometimes), or propping specialist (for complex work) |
| **Typical cost** | $300 - $2,000 for simple residential propping; $2,000 - $10,000+ for complex multi-level propping |
| **Risk if not communicated** | This is one of the most commonly disputed exclusions. The homeowner or builder assumes propping is "included" in the structural quote, but the structural installer's quote only covers beam installation. On the day, propping isn't arranged, and the beam cannot be installed — causing a full day of wasted labour and crane hire |

**Who typically provides propping in different contract structures:**

| Contract Structure | Propping Responsibility | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Builder-managed renovation | Builder arranges and pays | Usually hired from Shore Hire, Cassaform, or similar |
| Owner-builder (managing trades directly) | Must be arranged separately | Owner must hire props and arrange installation |
| Structural installer (full service) | Included in structural quote | Less common; must be explicitly stated in quote |
| Demolition contractor (if they offer it) | Included in demolition quote | Some demolition contractors include propping |

**Critical rule for scope generation:** Every structural scope must explicitly state whether temporary propping is INCLUDED or EXCLUDED. If excluded, it must state that propping is the responsibility of the builder or homeowner and must be in place before the structural installer arrives on site.

### 6.2.6 Making Good / Plastering Around Beam

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Framing a bulkhead around the beam, lining with plasterboard, setting joints, installing cornice, sanding to a paint-ready finish |
| **Why it is excluded** | The structural installer is a steelworker or specialist builder — not a plasterer. Their scope ends once the beam is in position, connected, and certified. Finishing work is a different trade with different skills |
| **Who it belongs to** | Carpenter (bulkhead framing) + Plasterer (plasterboard, jointing, cornice) |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $2,000 for bulkhead framing and plastering around a single beam |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Homeowner expects the beam to look "finished" after the structural installer leaves. Instead, they see a raw steel beam with exposed connections, rough-cut ceiling edges, and no plasterboard. The homeowner then faces additional cost to hire a carpenter and plasterer to finish the work |

**Breakdown of "making good" costs:**

| Task | Trade | Typical Cost (AUD) |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Bulkhead timber framing around beam | Carpenter | $200 - $800 |
| Plasterboard lining of bulkhead | Plasterer | $200 - $600 |
| Joint setting, cornice, sanding | Plasterer | $200 - $500 |
| Ceiling repair / patching where wall was removed | Plasterer | $300 - $1,000 |
| Floor patching / levelling where wall was removed | Builder / floor prep | $200 - $800 |

**What the structural installer IS responsible for:**
- Ensuring the beam is positioned correctly per the drawings
- Ensuring connections are complete and secure
- Leaving the work in a state ready for carpentry/plastering (no sharp edges protruding, no debris left)
- Providing access for the certifier to inspect connections

**What the structural installer is NOT responsible for:**
- Framing the bulkhead
- Plastering or gyprocking
- Ceiling repair
- Floor patching
- Any cosmetic finishing

---

### 6.2.7 Painting

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Painting the bulkhead, ceiling, walls, and any areas disturbed by structural work |
| **Why it is excluded** | Painting is the last trade in the renovation sequence. It happens after all structural, carpentry, plastering, and fit-off work is complete. It has no connection to the structural scope |
| **Who it belongs to** | Painter |
| **Typical cost** | $300 - $1,500 for painting the area around a beam installation (depends on extent of disturbance) |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Homeowner assumes the area will be "returned to original condition" including painted finishes. In reality, painting is a completely separate scope and must be quoted and scheduled separately |

**Special note on steel beams:** If the beam will be left exposed (not enclosed in a bulkhead), the steel surface requires:
1. **Primer:** Applied at the fabrication stage (typically a red oxide or zinc-rich primer)
2. **Top coat:** Applied on site after installation — either paint (to match ceiling/wall colour) or clear coat (for industrial aesthetic)
3. **Fire protection:** In some applications, the exposed steel may require intumescent paint or other fire protection per the NCC — this must be specified by the engineer and is a separate cost

---

### 6.2.8 Crane Hire

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Hiring a crane (Franna, mobile crane, mini crane, or Hiab truck) to lift and position heavy beams that cannot be manually handled |
| **Why it is excluded** | Crane hire is a significant cost that depends entirely on site access, beam weight, and lift complexity. Many structural quotes assume manual handling; crane hire is an additional cost if required |
| **Who it belongs to** | Builder (who arranges it) or Homeowner (if managing trades directly). The structural installer may arrange it on behalf of the client but bill it separately |
| **Typical cost** | $600 - $4,000+ depending on crane type and duration |
| **Risk if not communicated** | The structural installer quotes for beam installation assuming the beam can be manually carried in. On site day, the team discovers the beam is too heavy or access is too tight for manual handling. A crane must be arranged at short notice (premium rates) or the job is delayed |

**When is a crane needed?**

| Scenario | Crane Needed? | Typical Crane Type | Typical Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Ground floor, beam < 100 kg, wide access | No | Manual handling (2-3 workers) | Included in labour |
| Ground floor, beam 100-200 kg, moderate access | Maybe | Hiab truck | $600 - $1,500 |
| Ground floor, beam > 200 kg | Yes | Franna crane (pick-and-carry) | $800 - $2,500 |
| First floor / upper level, any weight | Usually | Franna crane or mobile crane | $1,200 - $3,500 |
| Tight access (terrace house, narrow lane) | Yes | Mini crane | $1,500 - $3,500 |
| Over roof of existing structure | Yes | Mobile crane | $2,000 - $4,000+ |

**Additional crane-related costs:**
- **Road closure / traffic management:** If the crane blocks a public road, traffic management plans and council permits may be required ($200 - $1,000+)
- **Power line clearance:** If overhead power lines are near the lift zone, the electricity distributor (e.g., Ausgrid, AusNet) may need to install insulation blankets or de-energise the line ($500 - $2,000+, plus lead time of 2-4 weeks)
- **Mobilisation/demobilisation:** Travel charge to get the crane to site ($200 - $500)

### 6.2.9 Footing Work (New Post Footings)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Excavation, formwork, reinforcement, and concrete pouring for new pad footings or bored piers to support new posts |
| **Why it is excluded** | Concrete / footing work is a separate trade (concreter or builder). It requires different equipment (excavator, concrete vibrator, formwork) and often happens days or weeks before the beam installation to allow curing time |
| **Who it belongs to** | Concreter, Builder, or sometimes the structural installer (if they offer a full-service package) |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $3,000 per footing (depending on size, depth, and soil conditions) |
| **Risk if not communicated** | The homeowner or builder books the structural installer without arranging footings first. The installer arrives but there are no footings for the posts to sit on. The job is delayed by 1-4 weeks (excavation + pouring + 7-28 days curing) |

**Footing requirements depend on soil classification (AS 2870):**

| Soil Class | Typical Footing | Approximate Size | Approximate Cost |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Class A (sand, rock) | Simple pad footing | 450x450x300mm | $500 - $1,000 |
| Class S (slightly reactive clay) | Standard pad footing | 600x600x300mm | $700 - $1,500 |
| Class M (moderately reactive) | Deeper pad footing | 600x600x450mm | $1,000 - $2,000 |
| Class H1/H2 (highly reactive) | Bored pier (engineer-designed) | 450mm dia x 1.5-3.0m deep | $1,500 - $3,000+ |
| Class E/P (extreme/problem) | Specialist design required | Varies | $2,000 - $5,000+ |

**Concrete curing timeline:**
- **3 days:** Concrete reaches approximately 50% of design strength
- **7 days:** Concrete reaches approximately 65-70% of design strength — minimum before loading for many applications
- **28 days:** Concrete reaches full design strength (typically 20-32 MPa for residential footings)

**The engineer will specify** when the footing can be loaded (i.e., when the beam and post can be placed on it). This curing period must be factored into the project schedule.

### 6.2.10 Electrical Relocations

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Rerouting electrical circuits, relocating power points, light switches, and light fittings that were in or on the wall being removed |
| **Why it is excluded** | Electrical work in Australia can only be performed by a licensed electrician. The structural installer does not hold an electrical licence and cannot legally touch any wiring |
| **Who it belongs to** | Licensed electrician |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $3,000 depending on number of circuits, cable rerouting complexity, and whether a switchboard upgrade is triggered |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Homeowner assumes wiring in the removed wall will be "taken care of." After the wall is removed, there are dangling cables, disconnected circuits, and power points that no longer work in other rooms. An emergency electrician call-out follows, at premium rates |

**Common electrical work triggered by structural modifications:**

| Item | Description | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Disconnect and remove circuits in wall | Isolation and removal of cables in the wall being demolished | $200 - $500 |
| Reroute circuits through new path | Cables that passed through the wall to other rooms must be rerouted | $300 - $1,500 |
| Relocate light switch | Switch on the removed wall must be relocated to a remaining wall | $150 - $350 per switch |
| Relocate power point | GPO on the removed wall must be relocated | $200 - $400 per GPO |
| Ceiling light relocation | If ceiling is disturbed, light fittings may need repositioning | $150 - $300 per light |
| Smoke alarm relocation | Hard-wired smoke alarms may need to be moved | $150 - $300 |

**Critical rule:** The electrician should disconnect and make safe all circuits in the structural work zone BEFORE demolition begins. This is a safety-critical step.

### 6.2.11 Plumbing Relocations

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Rerouting water supply pipes, gas pipes, or drainage lines that pass through or are embedded in the wall being removed |
| **Why it is excluded** | Plumbing work in Australia requires a licensed plumber. The structural installer cannot legally modify any plumbing. Gas work requires additional gas-fitting licence |
| **Who it belongs to** | Licensed plumber (and gas fitter for gas work) |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $5,000+ depending on pipe type, rerouting complexity, and whether under-floor work is required |
| **Risk if not communicated** | A water supply or gas pipe runs through the wall being removed. Demolition proceeds without the plumber relocating the pipe first. The pipe is damaged, causing a water leak or gas leak — creating a safety hazard, water damage, and significant remediation cost |

**Common plumbing impacts of structural work:**

| Scenario | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Water supply pipe in wall | Hot or cold water pipe running vertically in the wall | Must be capped and rerouted before wall removal |
| Gas pipe in wall | Gas supply to kitchen cooktop or heater | Must be disconnected and made safe by gas fitter before demolition |
| Drainage stack near wall | Vertical drain pipe adjacent to or within the wall | May need to be supported or rerouted — very expensive if in a concrete slab |
| Wet area implications | Structural changes near bathrooms or kitchens may affect waterproofing | Waterproofing may need to be redone in the affected area |

---

### 6.2.12 Scaffolding and Access Equipment

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **What it covers** | Scaffolding, elevated work platforms (EWPs), or mobile scaffold towers required for working at height during beam installation |
| **Why it is excluded** | Access equipment is a separate hire cost. Most single-storey residential beam work is done from a standard platform or step ladder, but double-storey work, high ceilings, or external work may require scaffolding |
| **Who it belongs to** | Builder, or structural installer (may be included or excluded — must be confirmed) |
| **Typical cost** | $500 - $3,000 for scaffolding hire (depends on height and duration) |
| **Risk if not communicated** | Structural installer quotes based on single-storey access. The job involves a double-height void or external work requiring scaffolding. The homeowner faces an unexpected variation for scaffolding hire and the delay of arranging it |

---

## 6.3 Exclusion Summary Table

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Exclusion | Belongs To | Typical Cost Range (AUD) | Must Be Arranged Before Structural Work? | Dispute Risk |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Structural engineer fees | Homeowner / Builder | $800 - $15,000 | Yes — weeks/months before | HIGH |
| Council / certification fees | Homeowner / Builder | $1,500 - $8,000 | Yes — weeks/months before | MEDIUM |
| Demolition of wall | Demolition contractor / Builder | $500 - $3,000 | Yes — immediately before | HIGH |
| Asbestos removal | Licensed asbestos removalist | $500 - $5,000+ | Yes — before demolition | HIGH |
| Temporary propping | Builder / Structural installer / Specialist | $300 - $10,000 | Yes — before demolition | VERY HIGH |
| Making good / plastering | Carpenter + Plasterer | $500 - $2,000 | No — after structural work | HIGH |
| Painting | Painter | $300 - $1,500 | No — last trade | MEDIUM |
| Crane hire | Builder / Homeowner | $600 - $4,000+ | Yes — same day as beam install | HIGH |
| Footing work (new post footings) | Concreter / Builder | $500 - $3,000 per footing | Yes — 1-4 weeks before | HIGH |
| Electrical relocations | Licensed electrician | $500 - $3,000 | Disconnection before demolition; rerouting after | MEDIUM |
| Plumbing relocations | Licensed plumber | $500 - $5,000+ | Disconnection before demolition; rerouting after | MEDIUM |
| Scaffolding / access equipment | Builder / Installer | $500 - $3,000 | Yes — same day | LOW |

## 6.4 What Happens When Exclusions Are Not Clearly Communicated

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 6.4.1 Common Dispute Scenarios

**Scenario 1: "I thought the beam price included everything"**
The homeowner receives a structural quote of $4,500 for "beam installation." They assume this covers engineering, propping, demolition, beam supply and install, plastering, and painting. The actual total cost is $12,000-$18,000 once all exclusions are added. The homeowner feels misled and files a complaint.

**Scenario 2: "No one told me I needed a crane"**
A 310UB steel beam weighing 240+ kg is specified for a 6m span. The structural quote says "beam installation" but does not mention crane hire. On installation day, the team cannot manually lift the beam into position. A crane must be arranged at short notice (premium rates, $1,500-$3,000) or the job is postponed, wasting a day's labour.

**Scenario 3: "The propping wasn't anyone's responsibility"**
The homeowner engages a demolition contractor and a structural installer as separate trades. Neither includes temporary propping in their scope. On demolition day, there are no props on site. Work cannot proceed. A full day is lost while props are sourced and delivered.

**Scenario 4: "Asbestos was discovered mid-demolition"**
The homeowner did not arrange a pre-demolition asbestos audit. During wall removal, suspected asbestos is found. All work stops immediately (WHS requirement). The site is sealed, a licensed removalist is engaged ($1,500-$5,000), and the project is delayed by 2-3 weeks.

### 6.4.2 Financial Impact of Poor Exclusion Communication

| Issue | Typical Additional Cost | Typical Delay |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| Engineering not arranged (rush engagement) | $500 - $1,500 premium | 1-3 weeks |
| Approval not obtained (work cannot start) | $0 (but delay costs mount) | 2-12 weeks |
| Propping not arranged (day lost) | $500 - $1,500 (labour wasted + emergency prop hire) | 1-3 days |
| Crane not arranged (day lost or premium booking) | $500 - $2,000 premium | 1-5 days |
| Asbestos discovered (unplanned removal) | $1,500 - $5,000 | 1-3 weeks |
| Making good not budgeted | $500 - $2,000 (unbudgeted) | 1-2 weeks |
| Electrical/plumbing not disconnected before demo | $500 - $3,000 (emergency + repair) | 1-5 days |

**Total potential cost blowout from poor exclusion management: $3,000 - $15,000+**

### 6.4.3 Legal and Regulatory Consequences

In Australia, building disputes can be escalated to:
- **NSW:** NCAT (NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal) under the Home Building Act 1989
- **Victoria:** VCAT (Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) under the Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995
- **Queensland:** QCAT (Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal) under the QBCC Act 1991

**Key legal principles:**
- Exclusion clauses using vague language like "any work not specifically mentioned" are viewed unfavourably by tribunals
- References to "builder's usual standard" without citing specific Australian Standards provide no measurable quality benchmark
- Under consumer law, the homeowner has a right to expect that the scope of works is clear and unambiguous
- Defective structural work carries a **major defect warranty period of 6 years** in most states (10 years in some states for structural elements)

## 6.5 Exclusion Defaults for Scope Generator

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Standard Exclusions (Include in Every Structural Scope)

The following should be listed as exclusions in every structural scope of works generated by ScopeAI:

1. **Structural engineering design and certification** — Certified drawings must be provided by others before work commences
2. **Council / certifier approval fees** — Building permit or CDC must be obtained by the homeowner or builder
3. **Demolition of existing structure** — Refer to demolition scope
4. **Asbestos testing and removal** — If present, must be completed by licensed asbestos removalist before structural work commences
5. **Temporary propping** — Specify whether included or excluded (confirm with installer)
6. **Making good / plastering around beam** — Refer to carpentry and plastering scopes
7. **Painting** — Refer to painting scope
8. **Electrical disconnection and relocation** — Refer to electrical scope
9. **Plumbing disconnection and relocation** — Refer to plumbing scope
10. **Certifier inspection fees** — Building certifier fees are the responsibility of the homeowner or builder

### Conditional Exclusions (Include When Applicable)

These should be included as exclusions when the conditions apply:

| Condition | Exclusion to Add |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Beam weight > 150 kg or difficult access | **Crane hire** — Crane or mechanical lifting equipment hire is excluded. Cost to be confirmed based on site access assessment |
| New post(s) required with new footings | **Footing work** — Excavation, formwork, reinforcement, and concrete for new post footings is excluded. Refer to concrete/footing scope |
| Work at height (double storey, high ceiling) | **Scaffolding / access equipment** — Scaffolding or EWP hire excluded if required for work above standard single-storey height |
| Home built before 1990 | **Asbestos risk** — Pre-demolition asbestos audit strongly recommended. If ACMs are found, removal is excluded from structural scope |
| Exposed beam (no bulkhead) | **Fire protection coating** — Intumescent paint or fire protection for exposed steel is excluded if required by the building certifier |

### Sample Exclusion Clause for Scope Document

> **Exclusions:** This structural scope of works covers the supply and installation of structural beam(s) and post(s) as specified in the certified structural engineering drawings. The following items are excluded from this scope and must be arranged separately:
>
> - Structural engineer design fees and certified drawings (must be provided before work commences)
> - Building approval / permit fees (CDC or DA)
> - Demolition of existing wall(s) and debris removal
> - Asbestos testing and removal (if applicable)
> - Temporary propping and shoring [INCLUDED / EXCLUDED — confirm]
> - Crane hire or mechanical lifting [INCLUDED / EXCLUDED — confirm]
> - New post footings (excavation, formwork, reinforcement, concrete)
> - Bulkhead framing, plastering, and finishing around beam
> - Electrical disconnection, relocation, and reconnection
> - Plumbing disconnection, relocation, and reconnection
> - Painting of any surfaces
> - Building certifier inspection fees
> - Scaffolding or elevated work platform hire (if required)
>
> All work is to be carried out in accordance with the certified structural engineering drawings. Any deviations require written approval from the structural engineer.

## 6.6 Contingency Recommendations

**Confidence: HIGH**

Based on industry experience and common dispute patterns, homeowners should:

- **Budget a 15-20% contingency** on the total structural modification cost (including all excluded items) to cover unforeseen issues such as asbestos, soil conditions, and access difficulties
- **Get the structural engineer engaged first** — before getting quotes from builders or installers. The engineer's drawings are the foundation for all other quotes
- **Request itemised quotes** that clearly distinguish between included and excluded items
- **Confirm propping responsibility in writing** — this is the single most disputed exclusion in structural work
- **Arrange an asbestos audit early** (pre-demolition) for any home built before 1990
- **Confirm crane requirements early** — ask the structural installer whether the beam can be manually handled or whether a crane is needed, and who arranges it
- **Allow adequate lead time** — structural work has more pre-construction lead time than any other trade (engineering + approvals + material ordering = 4-12 weeks minimum)
