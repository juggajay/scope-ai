# Structural Work Scope Items - Australian Residential Renovations

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-08
**Purpose:** Reference data for AI scope-of-works generator (ScopeAI)
**Coverage:** Detailed scope items for structural work in residential renovation projects (kitchen, bathroom, laundry, living area, outdoor)

---

## SECTION 3: Scope Items for Structural Work

Structural work in Australian residential renovations typically arises when load-bearing walls are removed (open-plan conversions), openings are widened (larger windows/doors), floor levels change (bathroom/laundry step-downs), or roof/ceiling modifications are made (raked ceilings, skylights). A licensed structural engineer must be engaged for all structural modifications.

---

### 3A. Load-Bearing Wall Removal (Most Common Scenario)

This is the single most common structural task in Australian home renovations. Homeowners want open-plan living by removing a wall between the kitchen and living area. The process involves multiple trades and a specific sequence of works.

---

#### 3A.1 Structural Engineer Engagement

**What is involved:**
- Site inspection and assessment of existing structure (identify load paths, roof loads, floor loads, wall construction type)
- Load calculations per AS 4100 (Steel Structures) or AS 1720 (Timber Structures)
- Design of replacement support system (beam type, size, material, connection details)
- Preparation of structural drawings and specifications
- Documentation for building approval (Development Application or Complying Development Certificate depending on council/state)
- Inspections during construction (typically 1-2 site visits: pre-pour/pre-beam and post-completion)
- Completion certificate / Form 15 or equivalent (varies by state)

**Who does this:** Licensed structural engineer (must hold registration in the relevant state/territory)

**Typical cost range:**
- Simple wall removal assessment + beam design: $500 - $1,500
- Complex multi-wall or multi-storey assessment: $1,500 - $3,000+
- Hourly rate for structural engineers: $150 - $450/hr
- Preliminary report (no detailed design): approximately $500 - $990

**Relevant standards:**
- AS 4100:2020 Steel Structures
- AS 1720.1:2010 Timber Structures - Design Methods
- AS 3700:2018 Masonry Structures (for remaining masonry elements)
- NCC 2022 Volume Two (Housing Provisions) for Class 1 buildings

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- A structural engineer is LEGALLY REQUIRED for any load-bearing modification in all Australian states
- The engineer designs the beam; the builder installs it. The engineer must inspect the installation
- Council approval (CDC or DA) is required before work commences in all states
- Some councils accept a private certifier; others require council assessment

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on multiple Australian structural engineering firms and NCC requirements.

---

#### 3A.2 Temporary Propping / Shoring

**What is involved:**
- Installation of Acrow props (adjustable steel props) to temporarily support the structure above the wall being removed
- Needle beams may be required: steel beams inserted through the wall to transfer loads to props on either side
- Props must be positioned per the structural engineer's propping plan (load-rated, specific locations)
- Sole plates (timber or steel pads) placed under props to distribute load on floors/slabs
- Head plates placed on top of props to spread load against ceiling/joists above
- Props remain in place until the permanent beam and posts are installed and certified

**Who does this:** Builder / carpenter (following the structural engineer's propping plan). For complex propping, a specialist shoring contractor may be engaged.

**Typical scope items:**

| Item | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Acrow props (hire) | Adjustable steel props, typically No. 2 or No. 3 size | Hire cost: $8-$14/prop/week. Typically 4-8 props for a standard wall removal |
| Needle beams | Steel beams inserted through wall to transfer load to props | Required when wall is load-bearing and direct propping from below is insufficient |
| Sole plates | 200x50mm or 200x75mm hardwood or plywood pads under props | Prevents props punching through floor/slab |
| Head plates | Timber or steel plates on top of props | Spreads load to ceiling joists/bearers above |
| Propping plan compliance | Installation per engineer's specifications | Must be documented and may be inspected |

**Sequence:**
1. Props installed BEFORE any demolition begins
2. Props remain in place throughout beam installation
3. Props removed ONLY after permanent beam and posts are in place AND certified by engineer

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- Temporary propping is typically included in the builder's quote (not a separate trade)
- Acrow props are the most common method in Australian residential renovation
- The house will have props in place for the duration of beam installation (typically 1-5 days)
- WHS requirements apply -- exclusion zones around propping areas

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian propping/shoring companies and industry standard practice.

---

#### 3A.3 Wall Demolition (Coordination with Demolition Scope)

**What is involved:**
- Wall removal after temporary propping is in place
- Brick, block, or stud wall demolition (method depends on construction)
- Removal of wall linings (plasterboard), framing (studs, noggings, plates), and any masonry
- Handling of services within the wall (electrical, plumbing, data) -- these must be isolated/relocated FIRST by licensed trades
- Waste removal and site cleanup

**Who does this:** Builder / demolition contractor. Electrical must be disconnected by a licensed electrician. Plumbing must be capped by a licensed plumber.

**Coordination notes:**
- This item appears in the DEMOLITION scope but is sequenced within the structural work timeline
- Electrical isolation and plumbing capping must occur BEFORE wall demolition
- The structural engineer's propping must be in place BEFORE demolition
- See ScopeAI demolition trade scope for detailed wall removal items

**Confidence:** HIGH - Standard Australian renovation practice.

---

#### 3A.4 Steel Beam Supply

**What is involved:**
- Beam type and size as specified by structural engineer (UB, PFC, SHS, or LVL -- see File 2 for details)
- Steel typically supplied primed (shop primer) for internal use
- Beam may require fabrication: holes drilled for bolts, end plates welded, cleats attached
- Beam cut to length (if not ordered to exact length)
- Beam delivery to site

**Common beam types for residential wall removal:**

| Beam Type | Typical Sizes (Residential) | Weight (kg/m) | Common Use |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------|------------|
| Universal Beam (UB) | 150UB14, 200UB18, 200UB25, 250UB26, 250UB37, 310UB32, 310UB46 | 14 - 46 | Most common for wall removal. Single-span beams across room widths |
| Parallel Flange Channel (PFC) | 200PFC, 250PFC | 22.9 - 35.5 | Lintels, shorter spans, where beam depth is constrained |
| SHS/RHS (Hollow Section) | 75x75, 89x89, 100x100, 150x150 | Varies by wall thickness | Typically used for POSTS/COLUMNS, not beams |
| LVL (Engineered Timber) | 200x63, 240x63, 300x63, 360x75 | Lighter than steel | Alternative to steel where loads permit. Easier to fix into |

**Typical supply cost (beam only, ex-GST):**

| Beam Size | Approximate Cost per Metre | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------|
| 150UB14 | $30 - $60/m | Lightest residential beam |
| 200UB18 | $45 - $80/m | Common for moderate spans |
| 200UB25 | $55 - $100/m | Heavier variant for longer spans |
| 250UB26 | $65 - $120/m | Common for open-plan living conversions |
| 250UB37 | $80 - $140/m | Heavier loads, longer spans |
| 310UB32 | $90 - $160/m | Large open-plan areas, upper floor loads |
| 310UB46 | $110 - $200/m | Heavy residential / two-storey loads |

*Note: Prices are indicative supply-only and vary significantly by region, market conditions, and supplier. Fabrication (welding plates, drilling holes) adds $200-$800+ per beam. As of 2025-2026, structural steel is approximately $2,300-$2,800 per tonne for material plus standard fabrication.*

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- The engineer specifies the beam -- the homeowner does NOT choose the beam size
- Beams are ordered to length (typically 3-6m for residential). Standard stock lengths are 9-12m, cut to suit
- Fabrication (end plates, bolt holes, cleats) is done off-site before delivery
- Allow 1-2 weeks lead time for beam supply and fabrication

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian steel suppliers (Edcon Steel, Steel Builders, Kelly Steel, Steel Mart) and industry pricing data.

#### 3A.5 Steel Beam Installation

**What is involved:**
- Lifting beam into position (manual handling for lighter beams, crane or Hiab for heavier beams)
- Positioning beam on prepared bearing points (posts, columns, or existing structure)
- Levelling and aligning beam (using packers/shims)
- Temporary fixing (clamps, tack welds, or temporary bolts) while connections are completed
- Final bolting or welding of connections per engineer's details

**Manual handling vs crane:**

| Beam Size | Approx. Weight (4m beam) | Lifting Method |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------|
| 150UB14 | ~56 kg | 2-3 workers, manual lift |
| 200UB18 | ~72 kg | 3-4 workers, manual lift possible |
| 200UB25 | ~100 kg | 4+ workers or mechanical assist |
| 250UB26 | ~104 kg | Mechanical assist recommended |
| 250UB37 | ~148 kg | Crane or Hiab required |
| 310UB32 | ~128 kg | Crane or Hiab required |
| 310UB46 | ~184 kg | Crane required |

**Access considerations:**
- Can the beam fit through existing doorways? Standard door opening is 820mm wide x 2,040mm high
- A 250UB beam is 248mm deep x 146mm wide -- it fits through a standard doorway
- A 310UB beam is 298mm deep x 149mm wide -- it fits through a standard doorway
- Length is the main constraint: beams over 4m may not navigate internal hallways/corners
- If beam cannot enter through the building, it must be lifted over/through the roof or an external opening
- Mini cranes (e.g., Maeda 405) can operate in tight access residential sites

**Who does this:** Builder / structural steel installer. For larger beams, a crane operator (dogman/rigger) is required.

**Typical cost:**
- Labour for beam installation: $500 - $2,000 depending on beam size and complexity
- Crane hire (if required): $500 - $1,500 for a half-day mini crane; $1,000 - $3,000+ for a standard crane
- Installed $/tonne range: $3,000 - $5,000 when fully delivered and erected

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian steel installation companies and crane hire services.

---

#### 3A.6 Post / Column Installation

**What is involved:**
- Steel posts or columns installed at each end of the beam (and at intermediate points for long spans)
- Posts typically SHS (Square Hollow Section) or RHS (Rectangular Hollow Section)
- Posts must bear onto adequate footings (existing footing may be sufficient, or new footings required)
- Base plate welded or bolted to bottom of post
- Post-to-beam connection via bolted cleat, welded, or proprietary connector
- Posts may be concealed within new wall framing or left exposed

**Common post sizes (residential):**

| Post Size | Typical Application |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 75x75x3 SHS | Light loads, short beams |
| 89x89x3.5 SHS | Standard residential |
| 100x100x4 SHS | Common for open-plan wall removal |
| 150x150x5 SHS | Heavy loads, two-storey, long spans |

**Who does this:** Builder / structural steel installer (same team as beam installation)

**Key notes:**
- Post locations are specified by the structural engineer -- they cannot be moved without engineering approval
- Posts at the ends of a removed wall often align with existing wall corners (less visual impact)
- If a post falls in the middle of a new opening, this affects the floor plan significantly
- Concealing a post within a plasterboard-clad column adds to finishing costs

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian steel suppliers and structural engineering firms.

**Sources:**

---

#### 3A.7 Connection Details

**What is involved:**
- Post-to-beam connections (top of post to underside of beam)
- Beam-to-existing-structure connections (where beam bears onto existing walls, piers, or columns)
- Base plate connections (bottom of post to footing)
- All connections specified by the structural engineer in the structural drawings

**Common connection types:**

| Connection | Method | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Post-to-beam (top) | Bolted cleat or welded | Steel angle or plate bolted/welded to both post and beam. Most common in residential |
| Beam-to-masonry wall | Bearing plate + anchor bolts | Steel plate set into or onto masonry with chemical anchors (e.g., Hilti HIT-RE 500 V4) |
| Beam-to-timber frame | Beam sits on double studs (trimmers) | Typically with a steel bearing plate to spread load |
| Post base plate | Welded plate + anchor bolts to footing | Steel plate welded to post base, bolted into concrete footing with cast-in or post-fixed anchors |
| Proprietary connectors | Column-to-beam connectors | E.g., Simpson Strong-Tie or similar. 12-gauge steel with corrosion-resistant coating |

**Packing and shimming:**
- Steel shim packs used to achieve correct beam level
- Shims placed between beam and bearing points
- Grout packing may be used for larger gaps
- All packing must be load-rated (not just offcuts of timber)

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian structural steel standards and engineering practice.

---

#### 3A.8 Footing Modifications

**What is involved:**
- If new posts bear onto existing footings with adequate capacity: no footing work required
- If new posts require new footings (common when post is in a new location): excavation + reinforced concrete pad or pier

**New footing scope items:**

| Item | Description | Typical Size |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Excavation | Dig hole for new pad footing | 600x600x400mm to 900x900x600mm deep (per engineer) |
| Formwork | Temporary boxing for concrete pour | Plywood or timber formwork |
| Reinforcement | Steel reinforcement mesh or bars (reo) | SL72 mesh or N12 bars per engineer's detail |
| Concrete pour | Ready-mix concrete to footing | 25-32 MPa (per engineer spec). Typically 0.1-0.3m3 per footing |
| Cast-in bolts | Anchor bolts set into wet concrete | M16 or M20 bolts, positioned per template |
| Curing time | Concrete must reach design strength before loading | Minimum 7 days, typically 28 days for full strength. Engineer may allow earlier loading |

**Who does this:** Builder / concretor. Reinforcement placement may require a steel fixer for larger footings.

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- New footings are only required if the engineer specifies them (not always needed)
- If the wall being removed sits on an existing strip footing, the beam posts can often bear onto that existing footing
- Soil type affects footing design: reactive clay soils (common in Melbourne, Adelaide, parts of Sydney) require deeper/larger footings
- Footing work may require a building inspector to inspect before the concrete pour

**Typical cost:**
- New pad footing (per footing): $500 - $1,500 depending on size, access, and soil conditions
- Includes excavation, formwork, reo, concrete, and cast-in bolts

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian footing standards and construction practice.

---

#### 3A.9 Making Good (Patching and Finishing)

**What is involved:**
- Patching ceiling around new beam (plasterboard, jointing, sanding)
- Patching walls where the removed wall met adjacent walls (reveals/returns)
- Floor patching where the wall plate/sole plate was removed (timber floor boards, tiles, concrete)
- Cornice replacement/matching around beam and at wall junctions
- Paint preparation on all patched areas

**Who does this:**
- Ceiling/wall patching: Plasterer / gyprocker
- Floor patching: Depends on floor type (carpenter for timber, tiler for tiles, concretor for concrete)
- Cornice: Plasterer
- Painting: Painter (see painting scope)

**Key notes:**
- Making good is often the most visible part of the job -- poor patching is obvious
- Matching existing cornice profiles can be difficult in older homes (may need custom run)
- Floor patching where a wall was removed often leaves a visible line (especially in timber floors)
- This work appears in both the structural scope (as an item) and the relevant finishing trade scope (as detailed work)

**Confidence:** HIGH - Standard renovation practice.

---

#### 3A.10 Beam Wrapping / Cladding (Concealment)

**What is involved:**
- If the beam is to be concealed within the ceiling line: plasterboard bulkhead constructed around beam
- If beam projects below ceiling: a boxed bulkhead with plasterboard cladding
- Timber noggings inserted between beam flanges to provide fixing surface for plasterboard
- Two layers of plasterboard recommended (fire compliance and robustness)
- Joints staggered between layers
- Jointing, sanding, and painting of bulkhead

**Bulkhead construction method:**
1. Timber noggings (typically 70x35mm or 90x35mm pine) friction-fitted or screwed between beam flanges
2. Plasterboard (10mm or 13mm) screwed to noggings -- NOT directly to the steel beam
3. Second layer of plasterboard applied with joints offset from first layer
4. External corners finished with metal corner bead
5. All joints taped, filled, and sanded
6. Primed and painted to match ceiling

**Who does this:** Plasterer / gyprocker (framing by carpenter)

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- A concealed beam creates a visible bulkhead (step-down in ceiling) typically 200-350mm deep depending on beam size
- If ceiling height allows and the beam is sized to fit within the ceiling/floor zone, no bulkhead is visible
- Exposed steel beams (painted black or similar) are a design feature in some renovations
- Never screw plasterboard directly to structural steel -- it can weaken the beam and creates thermal bridging

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Rondo bulkhead systems and Australian plastering practice.

**Sources:**

---

#### 3A.11 Fire Protection (When Required)

**What is involved:**
- For Class 1a buildings (detached houses, duplexes): fire protection of internal steel beams is generally NOT required by the NCC
- Fire protection IS required when:
  - The building is Class 2+ (apartments, multi-unit) -- FRL requirements apply per NCC Volume One
  - The beam forms part of a fire-separating element (e.g., between units in a duplex)
  - The beam is in a bush fire prone area (BAL rating) and is part of an external element
- Methods of fire protection (if required):
  - Intumescent paint (thin film -- expands in fire to insulate steel)
  - Calcium silicate board cladding (Promat, Fyreline)
  - Fire-rated spray (vermiculite or cementitious)
  - Plasterboard encasement (2 layers of 13mm fire-rated plasterboard = 60 min FRL)

**Relevant standards:**
- NCC 2022 Volume Two, Part 3.7.3 - Fire protection of separating walls and floors
- AS 4100:2020 Section 12 - Fire
- Table S1C2l and S1C2m (NCC) - FRLs for steel beams

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- For a standard detached house (Class 1a): fire protection of the steel beam is almost certainly NOT required
- For duplexes/townhouses with shared walls: check with your engineer/certifier
- Even where not required, encasing the beam in plasterboard provides incidental fire protection

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on NCC 2022 Volume Two and Australian fire engineering references.

**Sources:**
- [NCC - Fire-resistance of building elements](https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/editions/ncc-2022/adopted/volume-two/a-governing-requirements/1-fire-resistance-building-elements)

---

#### 3A.12 Certification and Inspection

**What is involved:**
- Building certifier (private or council) issues the Construction Certificate (CC) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) before work starts
- Critical stage inspections during structural work (varies by state):
  - Pre-pour inspection (if new footings)
  - Structural steel inspection (beam and connections in place, before concealment)
  - Final inspection
- Structural engineer provides a completion certificate confirming work matches their design
- Building certifier issues Occupation Certificate (OC) or equivalent at project completion

**State-specific variations:**

| State | Approval Type | Certifier | Key Legislation |
|-------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| NSW | CDC or DA + CC | Private certifier or council | EP&A Act 1979, Building and Development Certifiers Act 2018 |
| VIC | Building permit | Registered Building Surveyor | Building Act 1993 |
| QLD | Building approval | Private certifier or council | Building Act 1975 |
| WA | Building permit | Local government | Building Act 2011 |
| SA | Building consent | Private certifier or council | Planning, Development and Infrastructure Act 2016 |
| TAS | Building permit | Council | Building Act 2016 |

**Typical certification costs:**
- Private certifier (CDC or CC + inspections + OC): $1,500 - $4,000 for a residential renovation
- Council DA fees: vary significantly by council ($300 - $2,000+)

**Who does this:** Registered building certifier / building surveyor

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on NCC and state-specific building legislation.

### 3B. Door / Window Opening Widening

This is the second most common structural scenario in renovations. Homeowners want a wider opening for bifold/sliding doors, a larger window, or a servery opening between kitchen and living.

---

#### 3B.1 Structural Engineer Assessment

**What is involved:**
- Determine if the wall is load-bearing (this dictates the scope)
- If load-bearing: engineer designs a new lintel (steel or timber) to span the wider opening
- If non-load-bearing: may still need a lintel for brick veneer walls (supports the brick above)
- Load calculations, lintel sizing, documentation

**Cost:** Same as 3A.1 (may be combined if part of a larger project). Standalone: $500 - $1,200.

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

#### 3B.2 Lintel Supply and Installation

**What is involved:**
- New steel or timber lintel sized per engineer's specification
- Lintel must extend past each side of the opening by a minimum bearing distance:
  - Openings under 1,000mm clear span: minimum 100mm bearing each side
  - Openings over 1,000mm clear span: minimum 150mm bearing each side
- Lintels are required for all timber frame openings over 600mm wide and all steel frame openings over 900mm wide (per NCC Housing Provisions)

**Common lintel types:**

| Lintel Type | Typical Application | Sizes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Steel angle (equal or unequal) | Brick veneer over window/door | 90x90x6EA, 100x100x8EA, 150x90x10UA |
| PFC (Parallel Flange Channel) | Load-bearing wall, larger openings | 150PFC, 200PFC, 250PFC |
| UB (Universal Beam) | Heavy loads, wide openings (3m+) | 150UB, 200UB |
| Timber (hardwood or LVL) | Low-load openings, matching existing | 2x 190x45 F17, LVL 200x63 |
| Composite / back-to-back PFC | Very wide openings, heavy loads | 2x 200PFC bolted together |

**Installation sequence:**
1. Temporary propping installed above opening area
2. Wall cut or demolished to new opening width + bearing distances
3. Jamb studs (trimmer studs) installed at each side of opening (typically double studs)
4. Lintel lifted into position and set on trimmer studs
5. Lintel fixed to trimmer studs (bolted or strapped)
6. Temporary propping removed
7. Making good around new opening (plasterboard, render, brickwork)

**Who does this:** Builder / carpenter (steel fixing may involve a steel installer)

**Typical cost (supply + install):**
- Small lintel (under 1.5m, light load): $400 - $1,000
- Medium lintel (1.5-3m, moderate load): $1,000 - $3,000
- Large lintel (3m+, heavy load, steel beam): $3,000 - $6,000+

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on NCC Housing Provisions and Australian lintel standards.

---

#### 3B.3 Jamb Studs (Trimmer Studs)

**What is involved:**
- Double or triple studs at each side of the new opening to support the lintel
- Studs must be continuous from sole plate to top plate (or lintel bearing point)
- Material: timber (90x45mm or 90x35mm MGP10/MGP12) or steel (75mm or 92mm C-section)
- Fixed to floor plate and head plate with appropriate framing connectors

**Who does this:** Carpenter / framer

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

#### 3B.4 Making Good Around New Opening

**What is involved:**
- New door/window frame fitted into opening
- Plasterboard patching around frame on interior
- External render or cladding repair (if applicable)
- Architrave and trim installation
- Painting

**Who does this:** Carpenter (frame), plasterer (plasterboard), renderer (external), painter

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 3C. Floor Modifications

Floor-level structural work is common in bathroom and laundry renovations (especially on concrete slab homes) and when level changes are needed.

#### 3C.1 Slab Penetrations for Plumbing (Core Drilling)

**What is involved:**
- Holes drilled through concrete slab for new waste pipes, water supply, or drainage
- Diamond core drilling is the standard method (circular holes, precise, minimal vibration)
- Concrete cutting may also be required for trenching/chasing pipe runs in the slab

**Who does this:** Specialist concrete cutter / core driller. NOT the plumber (plumber marks locations, core driller cuts). Some plumbers sub-contract this directly.

**Typical scope items:**

| Item | Size Range | Typical Cost Per Hole | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Small core (waste pipe) | 65-80mm diameter | $80 - $150 | Typical for basin/shower waste |
| Medium core (toilet waste) | 100-110mm diameter | $150 - $250 | Standard toilet connection |
| Large core (floor waste/stack) | 150mm+ diameter | $250 - $350 | For combined waste or vent stacks |
| Slab chasing (linear) | 50-100mm wide x 50mm deep | $50 - $100 per metre | For pipe runs within slab |

**Additional costs:**
- Service fee / call-out: $100 - $200
- Reinforced concrete surcharge: 20-50% more (rebar increases drill time and blade wear)
- GPR scanning (to locate rebar and post-tensioning cables before drilling): $200 - $500

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- NEVER cut through post-tensioned slabs without specialist engineering advice (risk of catastrophic failure)
- GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) scanning is recommended before ANY slab penetration to locate tendons and rebar
- Core drilling creates significant dust and water -- containment measures required
- The plumber directs where holes go; the core driller makes the holes; the plumber connects pipes

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian concrete cutting companies (Advance Cutting, SEQ Concrete Cutting, Alpha Concrete Cutting).

#### 3C.2 Step-Downs / Level Changes (Bathroom, Laundry)

**What is involved:**
- Australian bathrooms and laundries often have the floor set lower than adjacent rooms (step-down / hob / rebate)
- This accommodates waterproofing membranes and ensures water drains to the floor waste rather than into adjacent rooms
- On concrete slabs: the step-down is cast into the slab at construction. In renovations, it may need to be created or modified

**Methods for creating a step-down in renovation:**

| Method | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Raised threshold (hob) | Build up a hob at the doorway using concrete or morite | Most common in renovations. Raises the transition point rather than lowering the bathroom |
| Slab rebate (if accessible) | Cut a rebate into the existing slab | Only possible if slab thickness allows. Requires structural assessment |
| Screed build-up | Pour a screed over the slab to create falls to floor waste | Common in renovations. Builds up the floor level rather than cutting down |
| Proprietary formwork | Cast-in rebate systems (e.g., MasterForm Rapid Rebates) for new construction | Typically new build, not renovation |

**Who does this:** Builder / concretor (screed work). Plumber (for floor waste and falls). Waterproofer (membrane application).

**Key notes:**
- NCC 2022 Volume Two requires wet areas to have waterproofing that prevents water damage to adjacent areas
- AS 3740:2021 (Waterproofing of domestic wet areas) specifies the requirements
- The step-down/hob height depends on the waterproofing system used and the floor finish thickness
- A typical hob is 25-50mm above the finished floor level of the adjacent room

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on NCC requirements and Australian waterproofing standards.

- [MasterForm - Rapid Rebates](https://www.masterform.com.au/formwork-products/setdown-form-rapid-rebates/)

---

#### 3C.3 New Concrete Pour / Screed

**What is involved:**
- Levelling screed to create falls to floor waste (minimum 1:80 gradient per AS 3740)
- Topping slab to raise floor level to match adjacent rooms after beam installation
- Infill concrete where a wall was removed (filling the old footing trench)

**Typical scope items:**

| Item | Description | Typical Thickness |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sand/cement screed | Hand-mixed or pump-applied screed for falls | 20-50mm |
| Self-levelling compound | Factory-mixed compound for flat surfaces | 3-20mm |
| Concrete infill | Ready-mix concrete to fill old footing or slab repairs | 100-200mm |
| Mortar bed | For tile installation with falls | 20-40mm |

**Who does this:** Concretor / tiler (for mortar bed) / builder

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3D. Roof / Ceiling Modifications

Roof and ceiling modifications are less common in typical room renovations but occur in living area projects (raked/cathedral ceilings) and when skylights are added.

---

#### 3D.1 Removing Ceiling for Raked / Cathedral Ceiling

**What is involved:**
- Removing the existing flat ceiling (plasterboard, battens, insulation)
- Exposing the roof structure (rafters, collar ties, purlins, underpurlins)
- Structural assessment of roof members -- existing collar ties and rafter ties may need modification or replacement
- Installation of ridge beam or alternative bracing if collar ties are removed
- Insulating the raked ceiling (between or under rafters)
- New ceiling lining (plasterboard) fixed directly to rafters or to new ceiling battens

**Structural considerations:**
- Collar ties resist rafter spreading at the ridge. Removing them requires an alternative load path
- Options include: structural ridge beam (most common), steel ties at a higher level, or knee wall bracing
- A structural engineer MUST design the modification -- collar tie removal without engineering is dangerous
- Rafter tie (at wall plate level) removal is particularly critical and almost always requires a ridge beam

**Who does this:** Builder / carpenter (framing), plasterer (ceiling lining). Engineer designs the modification.

**Typical additional structural items:**

| Item | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Ridge beam | Steel or LVL beam at the ridge to replace collar tie function | Must be supported at each end (gable walls or posts) |
| Rafter strengthening | Additional timber or steel bolted to existing rafters | If existing rafters are undersized for the new span |
| Insulation | Between-rafter insulation (batts or spray foam) | Must meet NCC energy efficiency requirements (R-values) |
| Ventilation | Roof ventilation above insulation | Required to prevent condensation |

**Key notes for homeowners:**
- Raked ceilings add volume and light but reduce thermal performance (hot in summer, cold in winter)
- Insulation is critical and more expensive than flat ceiling insulation
- The final ceiling height depends on the roof pitch and room width
- This is a significant structural modification -- budget accordingly ($5,000 - $20,000+ for structural component alone)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - Limited Australia-specific research on collar tie modification; general structural principles apply. Engineer engagement is mandatory.

---

#### 3D.2 Skylight Opening (Structural Trimming)

**What is involved:**
- Cutting an opening in the roof structure for a skylight
- Structural trimming: headers (cross members) installed above and below the opening to transfer loads around it
- Trimmer rafters (doubled rafters) at each side of the opening
- Flashing and weatherproofing of the roof penetration

**Structural trimming scope items:**

| Item | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Header beams | Timber or steel headers above and below opening | Sized per engineer or NCC span tables (doubled for openings over 900mm) |
| Trimmer rafters | Doubled rafters at each side of opening | Must carry the load from cut rafters |
| Hangers/connectors | Metal joist hangers connecting headers to trimmers | Simpson Strong-Tie or equivalent |
| Ceiling shaft (if flat ceiling) | Plasterboard-lined shaft from ceiling to roof opening | Required if there is an attic space between ceiling and roof |

**NCC requirements:**
- Skylights must comply with NCC 2022 Volume Two energy efficiency provisions (SHGC and U-value)
- Maximum aggregate area of roof lights is specified per climate zone
- Structural trimming must comply with AS 1684 (Timber Framing) or engineer's design

**Who does this:** Carpenter (structural trimming), roofer (flashing), plasterer (ceiling shaft), skylight installer (skylight unit)

**Typical cost for structural component only:** $800 - $2,500 depending on roof type and number of rafters affected

**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on NCC and Australian skylight installation practice.

- [Vivid Skylights - Roof Skylight Installation Guide](https://vividskylights.com.au/roof-skylight-information/)

---

#### 3D.3 Collar Tie Removal / Modification

**What is involved:**
- Assessment of existing collar tie locations and function (engineer)
- Options: remove and replace with ridge beam, relocate ties higher, or add knee wall bracing
- If removing: engineer designs a replacement system (typically a structural ridge beam)
- If relocating: ties moved to a higher position (reducing their effectiveness, so engineer must verify)
- All cut or modified roof members must be re-connected per engineer's specification

**Key rule:** NEVER remove collar ties or rafter ties without structural engineer approval. The roof can spread and collapse.

**Who does this:** Carpenter (framing modifications), under engineer supervision

**Confidence:** MEDIUM - General structural principles are well-established, but Australia-specific residential guidance for collar tie modification is limited in publicly available sources. Engineer engagement is mandatory.
