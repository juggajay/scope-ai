## 1. What Is a Structural Engineer?

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 1.1 Definition

A structural engineer is a specialist engineer who designs and analyses the structural elements of buildings and structures — the parts that hold the building up and keep it standing under all expected loads (gravity, wind, earthquake, live loads from occupants). In residential renovations, they ensure that any modifications to the building's structure maintain or improve its structural integrity and comply with the National Construction Code (NCC) and relevant Australian Standards.

### 1.2 Qualifications

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **University degree** | Minimum 4-year Bachelor of Engineering (Civil/Structural) from an accredited Australian university, or equivalent. Many structural engineers hold a Master's degree in structural engineering |
| **Professional experience** | Minimum 5 years of relevant post-graduate engineering experience (required for NER and CPEng registration) |
| **Professional body** | Typically a member of Engineers Australia (the national professional body). May hold Chartered (CPEng) status or be on the National Engineering Register (NER) |
| **State registration** | Required in some states (see Section 1.3 below). Registration is the legal requirement to practise; it differs from voluntary professional credentials like CPEng |
| **Professional indemnity insurance** | Required for practising structural engineers to cover errors in design |

### 1.3 State Registration Requirements

Registration of engineers is managed at the state/territory level, and requirements vary significantly:

| State/Territory | Registration Status | Key Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Queensland** | MANDATORY | Registered Professional Engineer of Queensland (RPEQ). Must be registered with the Board of Professional Engineers of Queensland (BPEQ) to provide professional engineering services. Long-established requirement |
| **New South Wales** | MANDATORY (for certain buildings) | Under the Design and Building Practitioners Act 2020, professional engineers working on Class 2 buildings (apartments) or buildings with a Class 2 part, Class 3 (accommodation), or Class 9c (aged care) must be registered with NSW Fair Trading. Does not yet cover all Class 1a (house) work, but structural designs for houses still require competent qualified engineers |
| **Victoria** | NOT YET MANDATORY | No statutory registration for structural engineers as of 2026, but the Victorian government has been considering introducing registration. Engineers should hold appropriate qualifications and insurance |
| **Western Australia** | MANDATORY (from 2024) | From 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2027, structural, fire safety, and fire systems engineers must be registered with the Building Services Board. This is a transitional registration scheme |
| **ACT** | MANDATORY (from 2025) | Registration of engineers commenced on 6 March 2024 for civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, and fire safety engineering. From 6 March 2025, all professional engineers providing services in these areas must be registered |
| **South Australia** | NOT YET MANDATORY | No statutory registration, but moves towards registration have been discussed at the national level |
| **Tasmania** | NOT YET MANDATORY | No statutory registration requirement for engineers |
| **Northern Territory** | NOT YET MANDATORY | No statutory registration requirement for engineers |

**Key takeaway for homeowners:** Always verify that your structural engineer is appropriately qualified and registered (where registration is mandatory in your state). Ask for their registration number, CPEng or NER status, and confirm they hold professional indemnity insurance.

## 2. Structural Engineer vs Building Designer vs Architect

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 2.1 Role Comparison

| Aspect | Structural Engineer | Building Designer | Architect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Primary focus** | Structural safety, load calculations, member sizing, connection design | Residential design, floor plans, building code compliance, construction documentation | Holistic building design — spatial, aesthetic, functional, and regulatory. Large-scale and complex projects |
| **What they design** | Beams, columns, footings, slabs, retaining walls, connections, bracing. The hidden structural skeleton | Floor plans, elevations, sections, specifications. The overall layout and appearance of the house | The complete building — spatial design, material selection, detailing, environmental performance |
| **Qualifications** | 4-5 year university engineering degree. State registration required in QLD, WA, ACT, NSW (for some buildings) | Diploma or Advanced Diploma (2-2.5 years, typically TAFE). Registered in QLD, VIC, TAS. No regulation in some states | 5+ year university degree (Bachelor + Master of Architecture). Must complete practical experience + registration exam. "Architect" is a legally protected title in all states |
| **Protected title?** | "Engineer" is protected in QLD (RPEQ). Other states vary | "Building Designer" is protected in QLD, VIC, TAS | "Architect" is protected in ALL Australian states and territories |
| **Typical residential fee** | $500–$6,000+ (see Section 6) | $3,000–$15,000 for a full house design | $8,000–$50,000+ for a full house design (typically 7-15% of construction cost) |
| **When you need them** | Any structural modification (wall removal, new beam, footing design, second storey) | When you need plans drawn for a renovation or extension that will be submitted to council and builder | For complex or high-end residential projects where design quality, spatial complexity, or site challenges warrant their expertise |

### 2.2 How They Work Together on a Renovation

In a typical renovation project involving structural work:

1. **Architect or building designer** produces the architectural drawings — floor plan, elevations, sections showing what the homeowner wants (e.g., "remove this wall to create open plan")
2. **Structural engineer** receives the architectural drawings and designs the structural solution — beam sizes, footing details, connection details, bracing requirements
3. **Builder** receives both sets of drawings and builds to both the architectural and structural specifications
4. **Building certifier** inspects the structural work at mandatory inspection stages

**Important:** A building designer or architect cannot design structural elements (beams, footings, retaining walls, etc.) unless they are also a qualified structural engineer. Similarly, a structural engineer does not produce architectural drawings. The two disciplines are complementary but distinct.

## 3. When Must a Structural Engineer Be Engaged?

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.1 Legally Required

A structural engineer MUST be engaged when:

| Scenario | Regulatory Basis |
|---|---|
| **Removing or modifying a load-bearing wall** | NCC requires structural adequacy. Building certifier will require engineer's drawings before issuing permits and during inspections |
| **Installing a beam (steel, timber, or concrete) to support loads** | Beam must be designed by a qualified person per NCC. Builder cannot self-select beam sizes for structural applications |
| **Designing footings for new construction** | NCC Volume Two, Part 3.2 (Footings and Slabs) — footings must be designed to AS 2870 or by a structural engineer |
| **Second storey addition** | Full structural design package required. Council/certifier will require engineer's drawings |
| **Retaining walls above state height thresholds** | State building regulations require engineering design above specified heights (see companion document) |
| **Deck/balcony attachment to masonry walls** | NCC Part 3.10.6 requires engineer design for deck attachment to masonry veneer |
| **Any work outside the scope of AS 1684 (deemed-to-satisfy timber framing)** | If the span, load, or configuration exceeds AS 1684 span tables, a structural engineer must design the solution |
| **Modifications to roof trusses** | Truss manufacturer or structural engineer must approve any modifications |
| **Work requiring a Construction Certificate (CC) or CDC with structural components** | Council or certifier requires structural documentation as part of the approval package |

### 3.2 Strongly Recommended (Best Practice)

Even when not strictly legally mandated, a structural engineer should be consulted for:

| Scenario | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Removing any internal wall (even if believed to be non-load-bearing)** | To confirm the wall is genuinely non-structural and doesn't provide bracing |
| **Adding significant point loads to existing floors** (stone benchtops, heavy baths, large aquariums) | Existing floor structure may not support concentrated loads |
| **Cracking investigation** | To determine if cracks are cosmetic or indicate structural movement |
| **Pre-purchase structural assessment** | Before buying a home, especially older homes with visible settlement or damage |
| **Changing roof cladding material** | Load changes affect structural capacity |
| **Large skylight installation** | Even if no structural members are cut, the opening affects roof diaphragm action |

### 3.3 NOT Required

| Scenario | Why No Engineer Needed |
|---|---|
| **Cosmetic renovations** (painting, new flooring, tiling, cabinetry) | No structural changes |
| **Replacing windows/doors in existing openings** (same size) | No change to structural opening |
| **Non-structural partition walls** (confirmed) within existing rooms | No load path changes |
| **Replacing roof cladding like-for-like** (same material and weight) | No load change |
| **Standard plumbing/electrical work** that doesn't penetrate structural members | No structural impact |

---

## 4. What Does a Structural Engineer Provide?

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 4.1 Core Services for Residential Renovations

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| **Site inspection / assessment** | Engineer visits the property, inspects the existing structure (roof space, subfloor, walls), reviews available plans, and identifies structural constraints |
| **Structural design** | Engineer calculates loads, selects appropriate member sizes (beams, columns, lintels), designs connections, and specifies materials |
| **Structural drawings** | Detailed drawings showing the designed structural elements — beam locations, sizes, connection details, footing details, bracing plans |
| **Engineering calculations** | Documented calculations (load paths, bending moments, shear forces, deflection checks, connection capacities) that demonstrate the design is adequate per Australian Standards |
| **Structural certificate** | A certificate signed by the engineer confirming that the designed works (or completed works) comply with relevant standards. Used for building approval and at completion |
| **Inspection during construction** | Engineer visits the site at critical stages (typically before beams are concealed) to verify the work matches the drawings. Required by some certifiers |
| **Certification of completed work** | After construction, engineer certifies that the structural work was completed in accordance with the approved drawings |

### 4.2 Load Calculations

The structural engineer accounts for all loads defined in **AS/NZS 1170** (Structural Design Actions):

| Load Type | AS/NZS 1170 Part | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Dead loads (G)** | Part 1 | Weight of the structure itself — roof tiles/sheeting, timber/steel framing, plasterboard linings, flooring |
| **Live loads (Q)** | Part 1 | Loads from occupancy and use — people, furniture, stored items. Residential floor: 1.5 kPa general, 2.0 kPa for balconies. Roof: maintenance access loads |
| **Wind loads (W)** | Part 2 | Wind pressure and suction on the building. Critical for roof connections, wall bracing, and wind uplift on lightweight roofs. Australia uses wind regions A through D, with classifications N1-N6 (non-cyclonic) and C1-C4 (cyclonic) |
| **Earthquake loads (E)** | Part 4 (AS 1170.4) | Seismic forces. Australia is a low-to-moderate seismicity region, but some areas (especially in VIC, SA, WA, NT) have design earthquake requirements. The engineer determines the site's hazard factor and designs accordingly |

---

## 5. Typical Deliverables

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.1 Structural Drawings Package

For a typical residential renovation involving structural work, the engineer provides a set of structural drawings. These typically include:

| Drawing | Content |
|---|---|
| **Structural plan** | Plan view showing locations of all new structural elements (beams, columns, posts) overlaid on the architectural floor plan. Annotated with member sizes and materials |
| **Beam schedule** | A table listing every beam in the project with: reference number, material (e.g., 310UB40.4 steel, 360x63 LVL), span, supported loads, and any special requirements (fire rating, corrosion protection) |
| **Connection details** | Detailed drawings showing how structural members connect to each other: beam-to-column connections (bolted, welded, or bracketed), beam-to-wall connections, post-to-footing connections. Specifies bolt sizes, weld types, bracket types, and fixing patterns |
| **Footing details** | Sections through new or modified footings showing: depth, width, reinforcement (bar sizes, spacing, cover), concrete strength (e.g., N20, N25, N32) |
| **Bracing plan** | Plan showing which walls provide bracing in each direction, with bracing ratings (in kN/m). If walls are removed, the plan shows how bracing is redistributed to remaining walls |
| **Slab details** (if applicable) | Slab thickening details, edge beam details, reinforcement schedules for any slab modifications |
| **Lintel schedule** | Table of all lintels over openings: reference, material, size, span, load width, bearing length at each end |
| **Roof framing details** (if applicable) | Where roof structure is modified — new ridge beam, trimming around skylights, rafter sistering details |
| **General notes** | Material specifications, construction tolerances, inspection requirements, relevant Australian Standards referenced |

### 5.2 Engineering Calculations

The calculations document accompanies the drawings and includes:

- Load take-down (tracing loads from roof through to footings)
- Beam design checks (bending, shear, deflection, bearing)
- Column/post design checks (axial compression, combined actions)
- Connection design checks (bolt shear, bearing, tear-out)
- Footing design checks (bearing capacity, settlement)
- Bracing adequacy checks (total bracing vs. required bracing in each direction)
- Wind load calculations (for the specific site — wind region, terrain category, shielding)

### 5.3 What the Builder Uses

The builder (and specifically the carpenter for framing) primarily works from:

1. **Structural plan** — to know where beams and posts go
2. **Beam schedule** — to order the correct materials
3. **Connection details** — to know how to fix things together (what bolts, what brackets, what nail patterns)
4. **Footing details** — for the concreter to form and pour correctly
5. **General notes** — for material grades and construction requirements

**Key point:** Structural drawings are a mandatory document on site during construction. The building certifier will check the physical work against these drawings at inspection stages.

## 6. Cost of Structural Engineering

**Confidence:** HIGH (aggregated from multiple Australian sources, 2025-2026 pricing)

### 6.1 Fee Structures

Structural engineers charge using one of three methods:

| Fee Structure | Typical Range | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Fixed fee per project** | $300–$15,000+ | Most residential work. The engineer quotes a fixed price based on the scope described |
| **Hourly rate** | $100–$300/hour (excl. GST) | Complex or uncertain-scope work, consultations, site inspections |
| **Percentage of construction cost** | 1%–5% for new homes, 5%–12% for renovations | Large projects where the full scope isn't defined upfront |

### 6.2 Cost by Project Type

| Project Type | Typical Engineering Fee (excl. GST) | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| **Single wall removal** (one beam design) | $500–$1,500 | Site inspection, beam design, connection details, structural certificate. May be at the lower end if the engineer can assess from plans/photos without a site visit |
| **Multiple wall openings / beam designs** (kitchen-living renovation) | $1,500–$3,000 | Site inspection, multiple beam designs, lintel schedule, bracing check, connection details, structural certificate |
| **Minor works** (deck, carport, pergola engineering) | $1,000–$2,500 | Site inspection, member sizing, footing design, connection details for attachment to house |
| **Full renovation** (multiple rooms, structural changes, possible roof modification) | $2,500–$6,000+ | Comprehensive structural drawings package, beam schedule, footing design, bracing plan, multiple connection details |
| **Second storey addition** | $5,000–$15,000+ | Full structural design: new upper floor framing, roof structure, load transfer to ground floor, footing assessment/redesign, bracing for both levels |
| **Retaining wall design** | $1,000–$3,000 | Site inspection, wall design (type, reinforcement, drainage), footing design, structural certificate |
| **Structural inspection / assessment only** (no design) | $400–$1,200 | Site visit, visual assessment, written report on structural condition or confirmation that a wall is non-load-bearing |

### 6.3 Additional Costs to Budget For

| Item | Typical Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Soil / geotechnical report** | $800–$1,500 | Required for footing design. Separate specialist (geotechnical engineer), not included in structural engineer's fee |
| **Structural certification of completed work** | $400–$800 | Engineer visits after construction to certify work matches drawings. Some councils/certifiers require this |
| **Urgency loading** | +20%–50% | Some engineers charge extra for fast turnaround or out-of-hours work |
| **Additional site visits** | $200–$400 per visit | If multiple visits are needed beyond the initial assessment |
| **Amended drawings** (design changes after initial issue) | $200–$1,000 | If the architectural design changes after the engineer has completed their work |
| **Stamped/certified plans** | $500–$2,000 | Engineer's professional seal on drawings, carrying liability. Some engineers include this in their base fee; others charge separately |

### 6.4 What Affects the Price?

| Factor | Impact on Cost |
|---|---|
| **Complexity** | More beams, longer spans, unusual configurations = higher cost |
| **Number of structural elements** | Each beam, footing, connection detail takes engineering time |
| **Existing documentation** | If original house plans are available, the engineer saves time. No plans = more investigation |
| **Site access** | Difficult-to-access roof spaces or subfloors increase inspection time |
| **Location** | Metro engineers may charge more due to overheads. Regional/remote projects may incur travel costs |
| **Engineer's experience/reputation** | More experienced engineers charge more but are often faster and more efficient |

**Scope impact for ScopeAI:** For a typical kitchen or bathroom renovation involving one or two wall modifications, budget $1,000-$2,500 for structural engineering. For major renovations with multiple structural changes, budget $3,000-$6,000.

## 7. Timeline

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (based on industry sources and engineering firm guidance; actual timelines vary by firm and workload)

### 7.1 Typical Timeframes

| Phase | Timeframe | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial consultation / site visit** | 1–2 weeks from booking | Engineers are often booked 1-2 weeks out. Some offer faster turnaround for simple jobs |
| **Site inspection** | 1–3 hours on site | For a single wall removal, 1 hour may suffice. Full renovation assessment: 2-3 hours |
| **Design and documentation** (simple — single beam) | 3–7 working days after site visit | Straightforward beam design, single connection detail, structural certificate |
| **Design and documentation** (moderate — multiple beams, bracing) | 1–3 weeks after site visit | Multiple beam designs, lintel schedule, bracing plan, footing details |
| **Design and documentation** (complex — full renovation or second storey) | 3–6 weeks after site visit | Full structural package. May involve iteration with the architect/designer |
| **Review and revision** | 1–2 weeks | If the architect changes the design or the homeowner makes changes, the structural design needs updating |
| **Total elapsed time** (typical renovation) | **3–6 weeks** from first contact to final drawings | Includes booking lead time, site visit, and design |

### 7.2 Tips to Speed Up the Process

| Action | Time Saved |
|---|---|
| **Have architectural plans ready** before engaging the engineer | The engineer can begin design work faster. No waiting for plans |
| **Provide original house plans** (if available — from council records, builder, or conveyancer's contract) | Reduces investigation time. The engineer can see existing structural layout |
| **Decide on design early** | Avoid scope changes after the engineer has started. Changes reset the clock |
| **Choose an engineer early** | Don't leave structural engineering until the last minute. Engage them when architectural design is 80% complete |
| **Communicate urgency** | Many firms offer expedited service for an additional fee |

### 7.3 Critical Path Impact

Structural engineering is on the **critical path** of a renovation:

1. **Architectural design** must be substantially complete before structural engineering begins
2. **Structural drawings** must be complete before a Construction Certificate (CC) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) can be issued
3. **Building approval** must be granted before construction begins
4. **Construction** cannot proceed past foundation stage without structural drawings on site

**Delays in structural engineering = delays in building approval = delays in construction start.**

### 8.2 What to Check Before Hiring

| Criteria | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| **Qualifications** | Bachelor of Engineering (Civil/Structural) minimum. Ideally Master's in Structural Engineering |
| **Registration** | RPEQ (QLD), NER or CPEng (national), state registration where applicable |
| **Professional indemnity insurance** | Ask for certificate of currency. This protects you if the engineer makes an error |
| **Residential experience** | Ask for examples of similar residential projects. A large commercial structural engineer may not be efficient at small residential jobs |
| **Local knowledge** | Familiarity with local council requirements, soil conditions, wind regions, and typical construction methods in your area |
| **Clear fee structure** | Get a written quote with a clear scope of what's included. Confirm whether the fee includes site visit, drawings, certification, and inspections |
| **Turnaround time** | Ask for estimated delivery timeline before engaging |
| **Communication** | A good residential structural engineer explains their findings and design in plain language, not just engineering jargon |

### 8.3 How Builders Find Structural Engineers

Most builders have established relationships with structural engineers they work with regularly. It is common and acceptable for:

- The **builder to recommend** a structural engineer (they know who produces clear, buildable drawings)
- The **homeowner to engage** their own engineer (provides independence, especially for complex or disputed work)
- The **architect/designer to coordinate** the structural engineer (most common workflow — the designer engages the engineer as part of the design team)

---

## 9. Council Approval Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 9.1 Approval Pathways for Structural Work

In Australia, structural work on a residential building requires building approval. The specific pathway depends on the state and the scope of work:

| Pathway | What It Is | When It Applies | Typical Timeframe |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Exempt Development** | No approval required | Minor non-structural work only. Structural work is almost never exempt | N/A |
| **Complying Development Certificate (CDC)** | Combined planning + construction approval issued by council or a private certifier | Straightforward renovations that meet pre-set criteria (e.g., within height limits, setback limits, not heritage, not bushfire-prone). Available in NSW, QLD, some other states | 10–20 working days (NSW) |
| **Development Application (DA)** | Planning approval from council | Required when the work doesn't qualify for CDC — larger extensions, heritage areas, bushfire zones, flood-prone land, or where neighbours may be affected | 40–90+ days (varies by council) |
| **Construction Certificate (CC)** | Construction approval confirming plans meet NCC/BCA | Required after DA approval, before construction starts. Certifies the detailed construction plans (including structural) comply with the building code | 10–20 working days |
| **Building Permit** (VIC, WA, SA, TAS) | Equivalent to CC in those states | Required before construction starts | 10–30 working days |

### 9.2 Documentation Required for Structural Approval

When submitting for a CC, CDC, or Building Permit involving structural work, the following documents are typically required:

| Document | Provided By | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Architectural drawings** (plans, elevations, sections) | Architect or building designer | Shows what is being built/modified |
| **Structural engineering drawings** | Structural engineer | Shows how the structure will work — beam sizes, footing details, connections |
| **Structural engineering calculations** | Structural engineer | Proves the design is adequate per Australian Standards |
| **Structural engineer's certificate** | Structural engineer | Statement from the engineer that the design complies with AS standards and the NCC |
| **Geotechnical (soil) report** | Geotechnical engineer | Soil classification for footing design (required for new footings) |
| **BASIX certificate** (NSW only) | Generated online | Energy and water efficiency compliance |
| **BAL assessment** (if in bushfire zone) | Bushfire consultant | Bushfire Attack Level determination |
| **Specifications** | Architect/designer | Materials, finishes, construction methods |

### 9.3 State-by-State Approval Summary for Structural Work

| State | Approval Body | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Council or private certifier | DA → CC → OC pathway, or CDC pathway. Private certifiers can issue CC and CDC. Principal Certifier (PC) oversees construction inspections. Must notify council of CDC and PC appointment |
| **Victoria** | Registered Building Surveyor (council or private) | Building Permit required. No CDC equivalent (but some minor works are exempt). Building surveyor inspects at mandatory stages and issues Certificate of Final Inspection or Occupancy Permit |
| **Queensland** | Council or private building certifier | Building approval required. Certifier inspects at mandatory stages (see Section 10). Completion certificate (Form 21) issued at end |
| **Western Australia** | Local council (Building Permit) | Building Permit required. Certified building plans must accompany application. Building surveyor inspects |
| **South Australia** | Council or private building certifier | Development Approval (planning) + Building Rules Consent (construction). Structural certification required |
| **Tasmania** | Council | Building Permit required through council. Structural engineering documentation required for structural work |
| **ACT** | Council or private certifier | Building Approval required. Structural certification must be from a registered engineer (from March 2025) |
| **NT** | Council (Building Permit) | Building Permit required. Structural certification from qualified engineer |

### 9.4 What Happens Without Approval?

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Building orders** | Council or building authority can issue orders to stop work, rectify non-compliant work, or demolish unapproved structures |
| **Fines** | Penalties for unapproved building work vary by state. In NSW, fines can reach $132,000 for individuals and $330,000 for corporations |
| **Insurance issues** | Home insurance may not cover damage resulting from unapproved structural work. A claim after a structural failure could be denied |
| **Sale complications** | Pre-purchase building inspections and conveyancer searches can reveal unapproved work. This can delay or prevent sale, or require rectification before settlement |
| **Personal liability** | If unapproved structural work causes injury or death, the homeowner and any trades involved face personal liability |

---

## 10. Building Certifier and Inspections

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 10.1 What Is a Building Certifier?

A building certifier (also called a building surveyor, principal certifier, or principal certifying authority depending on the state) is the person who:

1. Issues the building approval (CC, CDC, or Building Permit)
2. Inspects the work at mandatory stages during construction
3. Issues the final certificate at completion (Occupation Certificate, Certificate of Final Inspection, or Form 21)

Building certifiers can be council-employed or private practitioners. In most states, the homeowner or builder can choose between council and a private certifier.

### 10.2 Mandatory Inspection Stages (Structural Focus)

For a Class 1a residential building, mandatory inspection stages typically include:

| Stage | What Is Inspected | Structural Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Excavation / footing preparation** | Excavation depth and dimensions match engineering drawings. Soil conditions match geotechnical report assumptions. Formwork set correctly | HIGH — the footing must be in the right place, at the right depth, in the right soil |
| **2. Footing reinforcement** (before concrete pour) | Steel reinforcement size, spacing, cover, laps, and placement match structural drawings. Bar chairs and spacers in place. No debris in formwork | CRITICAL — once concrete is poured, the reinforcement cannot be inspected or corrected. The certifier (or engineer) checks this before the pour is authorised |
| **3. Slab reinforcement** (before concrete pour) | Same as footings — mesh or bar size, spacing, cover, laps. Slab thickenings at load points. Edge beams correct. Services penetrations sleeved correctly | CRITICAL — same as footings |
| **4. Frame stage** | All framing checked against structural and architectural drawings. Beam sizes and locations correct. Posts/columns correct. Connections match engineer's details. Bracing installed per bracing plan. Tie-downs installed. Lintels over openings correct | HIGH — this is where the structural skeleton is verified. Certifier checks stress grades of timber, wind braces, lintel sizes, point load paths, tie-down connections |
| **5. Pre-lining** (sometimes combined with frame) | Check before plasterboard or other wall/ceiling linings are installed. Verifies that all structural, insulation, waterproofing, and services work is complete and correct before it's concealed | HIGH — last chance to see structural connections before they're hidden |
| **6. Final inspection** | Complete building checked against all approved drawings and conditions. Siteworks, drainage, waterproofing, fire safety, glazing, energy efficiency, accessibility | MEDIUM (structural) — most structural elements are concealed by this stage. The certifier relies on earlier stage inspections and engineer's certificates |

### 10.3 Structural Engineer's Role in Inspections

In some scenarios, the **building certifier requires the structural engineer** (not just the certifier themselves) to inspect and certify specific structural elements:

| Element | Why Engineer Inspection May Be Required |
|---|---|
| **Steel beam installation** | To confirm the correct beam has been installed, in the correct orientation, with correct connections. The certifier may not have the structural expertise to verify complex steel connections |
| **Footing reinforcement** (complex) | For engineered footings (not standard AS 2870 deemed-to-satisfy), the certifier may require the designing engineer to inspect and certify the reinforcement before the pour |
| **Retaining wall** | Engineer inspection to confirm reinforcement, drainage, and construction match the design |
| **Post-tensioned slab** | Specialist inspection by the post-tensioning engineer |
| **Underpinning** | The underpinning engineer should inspect each stage of the underpinning work |

### 10.4 Documentation at Each Stage

| Stage | Documents Required |
|---|---|
| **Before construction** | Approved CC/CDC/Building Permit, structural drawings on site, builder's insurance (Home Building Compensation Fund in NSW, or equivalent) |
| **At each inspection** | Inspection request submitted to certifier (minimum 1-2 business days notice). Certifier completes inspection certificate (e.g., Form 16 in QLD) |
| **At completion** | All inspection certificates, structural engineer's completion certificate (if required), hydraulic compliance certificate, energy efficiency compliance, waterproofing certificates, termite management certificate |
| **Final certificate** | Occupation Certificate (NSW), Certificate of Final Inspection (VIC), Form 21 (QLD), or equivalent |

### 10.5 What Happens If an Inspection Fails?

| Outcome | What Happens Next |
|---|---|
| **Minor non-compliance** | Certifier issues a direction to rectify. Builder fixes the issue. Certifier re-inspects |
| **Significant non-compliance** | Certifier may issue a stop-work order until the issue is resolved. Structural engineer may need to attend to confirm the fix is adequate |
| **Structural element incorrect** (wrong beam, wrong reinforcement) | Work must be rectified before proceeding. This may involve removing and replacing elements — significant cost and delay |
| **Concealed without inspection** | If a mandatory inspection was not conducted before work was concealed (e.g., concrete poured without footing inspection), the certifier may require destructive testing (core samples, scanning) or the work to be exposed for inspection. This is costly and avoidable |
