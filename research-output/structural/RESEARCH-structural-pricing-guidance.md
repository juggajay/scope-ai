## 7.1 Structural Engineer Fees -- Simple Wall Removal Assessment + Drawings

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating Australian sources)

This covers the typical scenario: a homeowner wants to remove one internal wall (or create one new opening) and needs a structural engineer to assess the wall, determine if it is load-bearing, design the replacement support (beam + posts), and produce engineering drawings for the builder and council/certifier.

| Service | Cost Range | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Initial site inspection / assessment | $400 - $1,200 | Engineer visits site, inspects wall, determines load paths |
| Structural drawings for single wall removal | $1,000 - $2,500 | Includes beam design, post locations, connection details |
| Combined assessment + drawings (single opening) | $1,200 - $3,000 | Most common package for a single wall removal |
| Engineer certification of completed work | $400 - $800 | Post-installation inspection + Form 15/16 or compliance certificate |

### By Capital City (Single Wall Removal Package)

| City | Typical Range (Assessment + Drawings) | Notes |
|------|---------------------------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $1,500 - $3,000 | Higher end of national range |
| **Melbourne** | $1,200 - $2,800 | Comparable to Sydney |
| **Brisbane** | $1,000 - $2,500 | Slightly lower than southern capitals |
| **Perth** | $1,000 - $2,500 | Mid-range |
| **Adelaide** | $800 - $2,000 | Typically lowest of capital cities |

**Key notes:**
- Most structural engineers provide a fixed-fee quote after understanding the scope, rather than charging hourly
- Hourly consultation rates range from $150 - $300/hr (excl. GST) for ad-hoc work
- The engineer's fee covers design only -- it does not include the steel, installation labour, or demolition
- Some engineers offer a "design + certify" package that includes final inspection at a discount vs. booking separately
- Always confirm whether the quoted fee includes the final certification inspection or if that is an additional cost
- Urgency loading (rush jobs) can add 25-50% to standard fees

## 7.2 Structural Engineer Fees -- Complex Work

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (fewer public data points for complex scopes; ranges are wider)

Complex work includes multiple wall removals, full renovation structural design (new openings, floor strengthening, mezzanines), second-storey additions, or underpinning and foundation work.

| Service | Cost Range | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Multiple openings / full reno structural package | $2,500 - $6,000 | 2-4 structural modifications in same project |
| Full residential design package (major reno) | $5,000 - $15,000+ | New build or large-scale renovation with multiple structural elements |
| Percentage of construction cost | 1% - 5% | Common for larger projects; renovations can reach 5-7% due to complexity |
| Structural assessment report (for insurance / purchase) | $500 - $3,000 | Varies by property size and complexity |
| Soil testing (geotechnical report) | $350 - $1,500 | Often required for new footings; flat-fee soil test ~$350, contour + survey from $1,000 |
| Forensic / investigative engineering | $2,000 - $10,000+ | For existing structural defects, cracking investigations, legal disputes |

**Key notes:**
- For complex projects, engineers typically provide a detailed fee proposal after an initial briefing or site visit
- The percentage-based model (1-5% of construction cost) is more common for full new builds than for renovation-only work
- Areas with higher construction costs (Sydney, inner Melbourne) see higher engineering fees -- approximately 15-20% above regional areas
- Always engage the structural engineer BEFORE demolition begins to avoid costly redesign
- Some builders have preferred engineers they work with, which can streamline coordination

## 7.3 Steel Beam Supply Per Metre (Common Residential Sizes)

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from current Australian steel supplier price lists)

Universal Beams (UB) are the most common steel beam type used in Australian residential wall removals and structural openings. Prices below are supply-only, per lineal metre, from Australian steel merchants.

### Raw (Unpainted) Steel -- Per Metre

| Beam Size | Weight (kg/m) | Depth (mm) | Price Per Metre (incl. GST) | Common Residential Use |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **150 UB 14** | 14.0 | 150 | $56.50 | Light-duty lintels, short spans (<2m) |
| **150 UB 18** | 18.0 | 155 | $72.00 | Small openings, window headers |
| **200 UB 18** | 18.2 | 198 | $74.00 | Common for single-storey wall removals (spans to ~3m) |
| **200 UB 22** | 22.3 | 202 | $89.50 | Single-storey spans 3-4m |
| **200 UB 25** | 25.4 | 203 | $101.00 | Heavier loads on single-storey spans |
| **250 UB 25** | 25.7 | 248 | $103.00 | Medium spans 4-5m, single-storey |
| **250 UB 31** | 31.4 | 252 | $124.00 | Common for larger kitchen/living openings |
| **250 UB 37** | 37.3 | 256 | $147.50 | Heavy single-storey or lighter two-storey loads |
| **310 UB 32** | 32.0 | 298 | $128.00 | Two-storey loads, longer spans |
| **310 UB 40** | 40.4 | 304 | $161.00 | Common for two-storey wall removals |
| **310 UB 46** | 46.2 | 307 | $184.00 | Heavy two-storey loads, hip roof point loads |
| **360 UB 44** | 44.7 | 352 | $151.50 | Large spans, significant loads |
| **360 UB 56** | 56.7 | 359 | $193.00 | Heavy-duty residential, commercial crossover |

### Primed (Shop-Primed) Steel -- Per Metre

Add approximately $20-$25 per metre to the raw prices above for shop-primed finish.

**Example:** 200 UB 22 raw = $89.50/m, primed = $109.50/m

### Galvanised Steel Beams -- Per Metre

Galvanised UBs cost significantly more -- typically 30-60% above raw steel prices.

| Beam Size | Galvanised Price Per Metre (incl. GST) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **150 UB 18** | $128.07 |
| **200 UB 18** | $105.95 |
| **200 UB 22** | $144.24 |
| **200 UB 25** | $164.29 |
| **250 UB 25** | $161.43 |

**Key notes:**
- **Beam size is determined by the structural engineer** -- homeowners should never select beam size themselves
- Beam depth directly affects ceiling height at the opening (see Section 8 -- Mistakes). A 310 UB is ~300mm deep; if installed below joists, you lose ~350mm+ of ceiling height at the beam location
- For internal residential use, raw or primed steel is standard. Galvanised is typically only required for external or wet-area applications
- Additional fabrication costs apply for cutting ($5-$10 per cut), drilling, welding plates, and priming/painting -- typically $150-$500 per beam depending on complexity
- Standard lengths are 9m, 12m, or 18m -- you pay for the full length even if you only need 4m. Suppliers will cut to size
- Delivery charges apply and vary by location ($50-$200+ for metro delivery)

## 7.4 Steel Beam Installation (Typical Single-Span Wall Removal)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (costs vary widely by access, span, and scope; compiled from multiple sources)

This covers the labour component of removing a load-bearing wall and installing a steel beam to replace it. This does NOT include the engineer's fee (Section 7.1) or the steel supply cost (Section 7.3).

| Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Wall demolition (load-bearing, single skin timber frame) | $500 - $1,500 | Includes temporary propping setup, wall removal, waste disposal |
| Wall demolition (double-brick load-bearing) | $1,000 - $3,000 | Heavier, more labour-intensive, brick disposal costs |
| Steel beam lifting & installation (typical 3-5m span) | $800 - $2,500 | Includes manhandling beam into position, bolting/welding to posts |
| Steel post installation (pair, to support beam ends) | $400 - $1,000 | Includes base plates, fixing to existing structure or new footings |
| Make-good (plaster, cornice, painting to beam/bulkhead area) | $500 - $2,000 | Highly variable -- depends on finish required |
| Services relocation (electrical, plumbing if in wall) | $300 - $1,500+ | Varies widely; can be the most expensive surprise |

### Typical All-In Labour Cost (Excluding Engineer & Steel Supply)

| Scenario | Labour Cost Range |
|----------|------------------|
| Simple single-storey wall removal (3-4m span, no services) | $2,000 - $4,000 |
| Medium single-storey wall removal (4-6m span, some services) | $4,000 - $7,000 |
| Complex / two-storey wall removal | $6,000 - $12,000+ |

**Key notes:**
- Two-person team minimum required for steel beam installation; three or more for heavier beams (310 UB+)
- Access is a major cost driver -- if the beam cannot fit through existing doorways, wall openings may need to be enlarged first
- The builder must follow the engineer's propping plan exactly -- temporary supports must remain in place until the beam is installed and certified
- A building certifier inspection is typically required before propping is removed
- The beam installation sequence is: (1) install temporary propping, (2) demolish wall, (3) install posts/footings, (4) lift beam into place, (5) fix connections, (6) certifier inspects, (7) remove propping

## 7.5 Building Certifier / Inspection Fees

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (fees vary significantly by state, certifier, and project scope)

A building certifier (also called Principal Certifying Authority in NSW, or Registered Building Surveyor in VIC) issues the construction certificate, performs mandatory inspections, and issues the occupation certificate. For structural wall removal work, you need a construction certificate and at least one structural inspection before the beam is concealed.

### Construction Certificate / Building Permit Fees

| State | Typical Fee Range (Residential Structural Work) | Notes |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| **NSW** | $1,500 - $3,800 (CDC); $2,800 - $5,500 (DA + CC) | Private certifier fees; council may be cheaper but slower |
| **QLD** | $700 - $3,000+ | Private certifier; smaller works at low end |
| **VIC** | $800 - $2,500 | Building permit via registered building surveyor |
| **WA** | $700 - $2,000 | Council building permit |
| **SA** | $600 - $1,800 | Council building consent |

### Mandatory Inspection Fees

| Inspection Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Single structural inspection (framing/beam before concealment) | $200 - $500 | Per visit |
| Re-inspection (failed first inspection) | $150 - $350 | Per visit |
| Occupation certificate inspection (final) | Included or $200 - $500 | Often bundled into certification package |

### NSW Mandatory Critical Stage Inspections (Class 1 & 10 Residential)

For residential structural work in NSW, the following inspections are mandatory under the EP&A Regulation:

1. **Piers/Footings** -- after excavation, before concrete is poured
2. **Slabs or reinforced concrete** -- before concrete is poured
3. **Framing** -- before covering or insulation of floor, wall, or roof framing
4. **Waterproofing** -- before membrane is covered
5. **Stormwater** -- before drainage connections are covered
6. **Completion** -- once all works are finished

For a wall removal with new footings, inspections #1 and #3 are the critical structural hold points.

**Key notes:**
- An Occupation Certificate CANNOT be issued if a mandatory inspection has not taken place (unless deemed "unavoidable" with supporting evidence)
- Private certifiers are generally faster than council but more expensive
- Some certifiers offer "package" deals that bundle the CC + all inspections + OC for a single fee
- Always confirm upfront how many inspections are included and the cost of additional/re-inspections
- The Long Service Levy (NSW) is 0.25% of construction value for projects over $250,000

## 7.6 Temporary Propping Hire

**Confidence:** HIGH (hire rates are standardised and publicly listed)

Temporary propping (acrow props, strong boys, and supplementary timber) is required during any load-bearing wall removal to support the structure above while the permanent beam is installed. The builder is responsible for the propping plan, which must comply with the engineer's specifications.

| Item | Hire Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Acrow prop (standard No. 2, adjustable 1.7-3.1m) | $8 - $15/day; $15 - $25/week | Minimum 4 props per wall removal typically |
| Acrow prop (No. 3, adjustable 2.0-3.5m) | $10 - $18/day; $18 - $30/week | For higher ceilings |
| Strong Boy attachment (beam clamp for acrow prop) | $5 - $10/day; $10 - $20/week | Attaches to prop to support masonry above |
| Timber sole plates and head plates | $20 - $50 (purchase) | Usually purchased, not hired |
| Delivery and pickup | $50 - $150 | Metro areas; more for regional |

### Typical Propping Cost for Single Wall Removal

| Scenario | Total Propping Cost (Hire + Timber) | Hire Duration |
|----------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| Simple removal (4-6 props, 1-2 weeks) | $150 - $400 | 1-2 weeks |
| Medium removal (6-10 props, 2-4 weeks) | $300 - $700 | 2-4 weeks |
| Complex / extended timeline | $500 - $1,500+ | 4+ weeks |

**Key notes:**
- Props must remain in place until the structural engineer or building certifier confirms the permanent support is adequate
- Never remove propping prematurely -- this is a safety-critical item and a certified hold point
- Most hire companies require a minimum hire period (typically 1 week)
- The builder should include propping costs in their quote -- it should not be an unexpected extra

## 7.7 Complete Wall Removal Package

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (aggregated from component costs; wide range due to variability)

This is the all-in cost that homeowners should budget for when removing a load-bearing wall and replacing it with a steel beam. It includes every component from engineer through to make-good.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | Typical Range | % of Total |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Structural engineer (assessment + drawings + final certification) | $1,500 - $3,500 | 15-25% |
| Building certifier (CC + inspections) | $700 - $2,500 | 7-15% |
| Steel beam supply (typical 4-5m span) | $400 - $1,200 | 5-10% |
| Steel fabrication (cutting, plates, priming) | $150 - $500 | 2-5% |
| Temporary propping hire | $150 - $500 | 2-4% |
| Demolition labour + waste removal | $500 - $2,000 | 8-15% |
| Steel beam + post installation labour | $1,000 - $3,000 | 15-25% |
| New footings (if required for posts) | $500 - $2,000 | 5-15% |
| Services relocation (electrical, plumbing) | $0 - $2,000 | 0-15% |
| Make-good (plastering, cornice, painting) | $500 - $2,000 | 8-15% |
| Council fees (if DA required) | $0 - $2,000 | 0-10% |

### Total Package Costs

| Scenario | Total Cost Range | Typical |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Simple** -- single-storey, short span (2-3m), no services in wall, no new footings needed | $4,000 - $8,000 | $5,000 - $6,000 |
| **Medium** -- single-storey, medium span (3-5m), some services, minor footings | $8,000 - $15,000 | $10,000 - $12,000 |
| **Complex** -- long span (5m+), two-storey, services relocation, new footings, DA required | $15,000 - $30,000+ | $18,000 - $22,000 |

### By Capital City (Medium Scenario)

| City | Total Package Range |
|------|-------------------|
| **Sydney** | $10,000 - $18,000 |
| **Melbourne** | $9,000 - $16,000 |
| **Brisbane** | $8,000 - $14,000 |
| **Perth** | $8,000 - $14,000 |
| **Adelaide** | $7,000 - $12,000 |

**Key notes:**
- The most common mistake homeowners make is budgeting only for the steel beam and demolition, forgetting the engineer, certifier, footings, services relocation, and make-good
- A "simple" wall removal that seems like $3,000-$4,000 often ends up at $6,000-$8,000 once all components are included
- Always get a written quote that itemises every component listed above
- Contingency: budget an additional 10-15% for unexpected issues (concealed services, inadequate existing footings, asbestos in older homes)

## 7.8 Post / Column Supply & Install

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (limited published data on per-column pricing; derived from steel pricing + labour estimates)

When a load-bearing wall is removed, the replacement beam must be supported at each end (and sometimes at intermediate points) by steel posts or columns. These transfer the beam loads down to the foundation.

### Steel Post Supply (Material Only)

| Post Type | Typical Size | Supply Cost Per Post (2.4-2.7m) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| SHS (Square Hollow Section) | 75x75x4 mm | $80 - $150 | Light residential loads |
| SHS | 89x89x3.5 mm | $100 - $180 | Standard residential |
| SHS | 100x100x4 mm | $120 - $250 | Common for single-storey beam supports |
| SHS | 125x125x5 mm | $200 - $350 | Heavier loads, two-storey |
| SHS | 150x150x5 mm | $250 - $450 | Heavy residential / commercial crossover |

### Post Installation (Labour)

| Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Base plate fabrication + welding (per post) | $80 - $200 | Steel plate welded to bottom of post |
| Top connection plate/bracket | $80 - $200 | Connects post to beam; bolted or welded |
| Post installation labour (per post) | $200 - $600 | Includes plumbing vertical, fixing top and bottom |
| Post cladding/boxing (timber or plaster wrap) | $150 - $400 per post | Cosmetic concealment |

### Typical All-In Cost Per Post (Supply + Fabricate + Install)

| Scenario | Cost Per Post |
|----------|--------------|
| Simple (SHS post, existing adequate footing, bolt connection) | $400 - $800 |
| Standard (SHS post, new pad footing, welded connections, cladding) | $800 - $1,500 |
| Complex (larger section, deep footing, fire rating or special finish) | $1,500 - $2,500+ |

**Key notes:**
- Post size is specified by the structural engineer -- it depends on the beam span and load being carried
- Posts must bear on adequate footings (see Section 7.9) -- if existing footings are inadequate, new concrete pads are required
- Most residential wall removals require 2 posts (one at each end of the beam), but longer spans may need intermediate posts
- The position of posts can significantly affect the open-plan feel -- discuss post locations with the engineer early
- Posts can be concealed within plasterboard boxing or left exposed as a design feature

## 7.9 Footing Modifications (New Concrete Pad/Pier for Posts)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (costs vary significantly by soil conditions, access, and footing type)

When a new steel post is installed to support a beam, the post load must be transferred to the ground through an adequate footing. In many cases, the existing floor slab or strip footing is not designed to carry the concentrated point load from a steel post, so a new concrete pad footing (or pier) is required.

| Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Concrete pad footing (typical 600x600x400mm) | $500 - $1,200 per pad | Includes excavation, formwork, reinforcement, concrete pour |
| Concrete pad footing (larger, 900x900x600mm) | $800 - $2,000 per pad | For heavier loads or poor soil |
| Screw pier/pile (alternative to pad footing) | $300 - $800 per pier | Faster install, less excavation; suits reactive soils |
| Core-drilling through existing slab | $200 - $500 per penetration | If post bears through a concrete slab |
| Excavation (manual, inside house) | $300 - $800 | Limited access; hand-dig only |
| Concrete supply (small quantity, ready-mix) | $250 - $500 per delivery | Minimum order charges apply; ~$250/m3 plus delivery |
| Soil testing (if required by engineer) | $350 - $1,500 | Geotechnical report for soil classification |

### Typical All-In Footing Cost Per Post Location

| Scenario | Cost Per Footing |
|----------|-----------------|
| Simple -- post on existing adequate slab/footing, no modification needed | $0 |
| Standard -- new 600x600 pad footing in existing floor | $700 - $1,500 |
| Complex -- deep footing, poor soil, restricted access, slab penetration | $1,500 - $3,000+ |

**Key notes:**
- The structural engineer determines whether existing footings are adequate or if new footings are required
- In older homes (pre-1960s), existing footings are often inadequate for concentrated beam loads
- Footing inspections are a mandatory hold point -- the certifier must inspect the footing BEFORE concrete is poured
- Soil conditions significantly affect footing size and depth; reactive clay soils (common in Melbourne, Adelaide, parts of Sydney) require deeper or wider footings
- The footing must comply with AS 2870 (Residential Slabs and Footings) and the engineer's specifications

## 7.10 Lintel Supply & Install (Door/Window Openings)

**Confidence:** HIGH (steel lintel prices well-documented from suppliers)

Lintels are shorter structural members that support the wall above a door or window opening. They are smaller and lighter than beams used for full wall removals. In Australian residential construction, steel angle lintels and flat bar lintels are most common.

### Steel Lintel Supply (Material Only)

#### Angle Lintels (100 x 100 x 6mm) -- Standard for Brick Veneer

| Length | Typical Opening | Price (incl. GST) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|

### Lintel Installation Labour

| Component | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Lintel installation (single opening, brick veneer) | $200 - $600 | Includes propping, cutting, bedding lintel, make-good |
| Lintel installation (double-brick / masonry) | $400 - $1,000 | More propping required, heavier materials |
| New window/door opening creation (cut + lintel) | $800 - $2,500 | Includes cutting opening, lintel install, frame install |

### Typical All-In Cost (Supply + Install)

| Scenario | Total Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| Replace existing lintel (standard window) | $300 - $800 |
| New opening with lintel (standard door) | $1,000 - $2,000 |
| New opening with lintel (wide sliding door, 2.4m+) | $1,500 - $3,500 |

**Key notes:**
- Lintel size and type must be specified by the structural engineer based on the span and load above
- Lintels for full brick construction (cavity brick or double brick) require a lintel on each skin of brickwork
- The standard bearing (how far the lintel sits into the wall on each side) is minimum 100-150mm per end
- Galvanised lintels are recommended for external walls and any wet areas
- T-bar lintels (for larger openings, 2.7m+) cost significantly more: $777 - $2,093 for 2.7m-6.3m lengths

## 7.11 Council Application Fees (DA, CDC)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (fees vary by council, state, and project value; indicative ranges only)

Whether you need council approval for structural work depends on your state and the scope of the work. In most states, internal structural modifications (wall removal, new openings) require at minimum a construction certificate or building permit. In some cases, a Development Application (DA) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) is also required.

### When Approval Is Required

| Work Type | Typical Approval Pathway | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| Internal load-bearing wall removal | Construction Certificate (CC) or Building Permit | Required in all states |
| New window/door opening in external wall | CDC or DA (state-dependent) | External changes may require planning approval |
| Structural modification in heritage zone | DA required | Longer timeframe, higher fees |
| Work affecting fire separation walls (attached dwellings) | DA + BCA compliance | Strata/duplex additional requirements |

### Typical Fee Ranges by State

| State | CDC / Building Permit Fee | DA Application Fee | Notes |
|-------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **NSW** | $1,500 - $3,800 | $1,000 - $5,000+ | DA fee calculated on estimated development cost; ~$565-$1,100 for works under $100k |
| **VIC** | $800 - $2,500 | $546 - $2,000+ | Building permit via registered building surveyor; planning permit if external changes |
| **QLD** | $700 - $2,000 | $1,000 - $3,000+ | Building approval through private certifier or council |
| **WA** | $700 - $2,000 | $500 - $2,500 | Council building permit |
| **SA** | $600 - $1,800 | $400 - $2,000 | Development approval through council or private certifier |

### Additional Government Fees

| Fee Type | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Long Service Levy (NSW) | 0.25% of construction value | For projects valued at $250,000+ |
| Building Practitioners Board levy (VIC) | ~$128 per project | Statutory levy |
| QBCC insurance (QLD) | Varies | Required for work over $3,300 |

**Key notes:**
- DA fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the estimated development cost, with tiered fee schedules set by regulation
- CDC (Complying Development) is faster and often cheaper than a full DA, but not all work qualifies
- Private certifiers can issue CDCs and construction certificates faster than council (often days vs. weeks/months)
- Heritage-listed or conservation-area properties almost always require a full DA regardless of work scope
- The application fee is separate from the certifier's professional fees (Section 7.5)
- Always confirm with your local council or certifier which approval pathway applies to your specific project
