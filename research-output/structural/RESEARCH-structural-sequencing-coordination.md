## 5.1 Where Structural Work Sits in the Renovation Sequence

**Confidence: HIGH**

Structural work is one of the earliest trades on a renovation project. It sits immediately after demolition and before any framing, lining, or fit-out work. Structural work is on the **critical path** — every downstream trade depends on it being completed and certified before they can proceed.

### Typical Renovation Sequence (Structural in Context)

```
1. Pre-construction (engineering, approvals, permits)
2. Demolition (removal of existing walls, finishes, fixtures)
3. Asbestos removal (if identified in pre-demolition audit)
4. STRUCTURAL WORK (beams, posts, lintels, footings) ← THIS TRADE
5. Framing / carpentry (new wall frames, bulkheads around beams)
6. Rough-in trades (plumbing, electrical, HVAC)
7. Insulation
8. Plasterboard / lining
9. Waterproofing (wet areas)
10. Tiling
11. Cabinetry / joinery
12. Second fix (plumbing, electrical)
13. Painting
14. Final fix / commissioning
```

**Key principle:** Structural work creates the skeleton that everything else hangs off. If a load-bearing wall is being removed and replaced with a beam, that beam must be in place, connected, and inspected before any new framing, wiring, or plumbing can begin in that area.

## 5.2 What Must Happen BEFORE Structural Work

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 5.2.1 Structural Engineer Has Provided Certified Drawings

A structural engineer must design and specify all structural elements before any work begins. The engineer calculates the loads being carried by the existing structure and specifies appropriate replacement members (steel beam, LVL, glulam, or timber lintel).

**What the engineer provides:**
- Certified structural drawings showing beam sizes, post locations, connection details, and footing requirements
- Specification of materials (e.g., 310UB40.4 steel beam, or 360x75 LVL)
- Connection detail drawings (bolted, welded, or proprietary brackets)
- Footing design for any new posts (pad footings designed to AS 2870)
- Temporary propping requirements and methodology
- Any special conditions (e.g., staged loading, sequence of removal)

**Typical engineering fees in Australia:**

| Scope | Typical Fee Range (AUD, excl. GST) |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| Single beam design (load-bearing wall removal) | $800 - $2,500 |
| Beam + footing design | $1,500 - $3,500 |
| Full structural assessment report + drawings | $3,000 - $5,000 |
| Complex multi-beam / multi-level design | $5,000 - $15,000+ |
| Hourly rate (if charged hourly) | $150 - $300/hr |

**Critical rule:** No structural work should commence without certified engineering drawings. The builder, structural tradesperson, and building certifier all need copies. Working without engineering is illegal for structural modifications and voids insurance.

### 5.2.2 Council / Certifier Approval Obtained

In all Australian states and territories, altering a load-bearing wall or structural element requires building approval. This can be obtained via two pathways:

| Pathway | Issued By | Typical Timeframe | Typical Cost |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Complying Development Certificate (CDC)** | Private certifier | 3-10 business days | $1,500 - $4,000 |
| **Development Application (DA) + Construction Certificate (CC)** | Local council | 4-12 weeks | $2,000 - $8,000+ |

**NSW:** Internal load-bearing wall removal can often be done under a CDC (Complying Development Certificate), which is faster and cheaper than a DA through council. A private certifier can issue a CDC in as little as three business days.

**Victoria:** A building permit is required from a registered building surveyor. The building surveyor reviews the structural engineer's design and issues the permit before work commences.

**Queensland:** Building approval is required through a private certifier or council, with mandatory inspection stages specified in the Building Regulation 2021.

**Critical rule:** Work must NOT commence until written approval is in hand. Unapproved structural work can result in fines, mandatory demolition orders, insurance voidance, and significant problems at property sale.

- [Victorian Building Authority - Building Permits](https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/building/mi-01-mandatory-notifications-and-inspections-of-building-work)

### 5.2.3 Demolition Complete

All demolition in the structural work zone must be complete before beam installation begins. This includes:

- Removal of non-load-bearing wall linings (plasterboard, lath and plaster)
- Removal of floor coverings in the work zone
- Removal of ceiling linings where beam will be installed
- Clearing and removal of all demolition debris
- Exposure of existing structural members for inspection

**Important:** The structural engineer should inspect the exposed structure before beam installation to confirm that actual conditions match the design assumptions. Older homes (pre-1960s) may have different framing configurations than expected.

**Asbestos warning:** Any home built before 1990 may contain asbestos in wall linings, ceiling sheets, eaves, or backing materials. An asbestos audit must be completed before demolition. If asbestos is found, licensed asbestos removal must occur before any structural work. Builders and tradespeople cannot legally remove more than 10m2 of non-friable asbestos without an asbestos removal licence.

### 5.2.4 Temporary Propping in Place

Before any load-bearing element is removed, temporary propping must be installed to support the loads above. This is a critical safety step.

**What temporary propping involves:**

1. **Engineering:** The propping arrangement must be designed or approved by the structural engineer. The propping plan specifies prop locations, load capacities, and bearing requirements.
2. **Equipment:** Acrow props (steel adjustable props) are the most common system used in residential work. A "Strongboy" attachment allows an Acrow prop to support a masonry wall above a lintel opening — one of the most common uses in renovation.
3. **Installation:** Props are installed through the load path from the roof/ceiling structure down to the ground/slab. Props must bear on solid structure (not just plasterboard or floating floor).
4. **Certification:** For complex propping, the engineer or builder may need to certify the propping is installed correctly before demolition of the load-bearing element proceeds.

**Typical prop hire costs:**

| Item | Typical Cost (AUD) |
|------|---------------------|
| Acrow prop hire (per prop, per week) | $15 - $35 |
| Strongboy attachment hire (per unit, per week) | $20 - $40 |
| Delivery and pickup | $80 - $200 |
| Engineered propping plan (if required) | $500 - $1,500 |

**Who is responsible for propping?** This varies by contract:
- If a **builder** is managing the project, propping is typically the builder's responsibility and included in the building contract
- If the homeowner is managing trades directly (**owner-builder**), propping must be arranged as a separate scope — either by the structural tradesperson or a specialist shoring company
- Some structural steel installers include propping in their scope; many do not. This **must be clarified in writing** before work begins

## 5.3 What Happens DURING Structural Work

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 5.3.1 Beam Delivery and Site Access

Structural beams must be delivered to site and manoeuvred into position. This is a logistics challenge on many Australian residential sites due to narrow driveways, fences, landscaping, overhead power lines, and neighbouring properties.

**Beam types and typical weights:**

| Beam Type | Common Residential Sizes | Weight per Metre | Typical Max Span (Residential) |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Steel UB (Universal Beam) - 200UB | 200UB18.2, 200UB22.3 | 18.2 - 22.3 kg/m | 4-5m |
| Steel UB - 250UB | 250UB25.7, 250UB31.4 | 25.7 - 31.4 kg/m | 5-6m |
| Steel UB - 310UB | 310UB40.4, 310UB46.2 | 40.4 - 46.2 kg/m | 6-8m |
| Steel UB - 360UB | 360UB44.7, 360UB56.7 | 44.7 - 56.7 kg/m | 7-10m |
| LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) | 300x63, 360x75, 400x75 | 8 - 18 kg/m | 4-7m (multiple members may be required) |
| Glulam (Glue-Laminated Timber) | GL17, GL18 grades | 10 - 25 kg/m | 5-10m+ |

**Example real-world weights:**
- A 4.5m long 250UB31.4 steel beam weighs approximately 141 kg — this requires 3-4 people or mechanical lifting
- A 6m long 310UB40.4 steel beam weighs approximately 242 kg — this typically requires crane assistance
- A 4m LVL beam (360x75) weighs approximately 40 kg — manageable by 2 people

**Access considerations:**

| Access Scenario | Lifting Method | Additional Cost |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Wide driveway, ground floor, beam < 150 kg | Manual handling (3-4 workers) | Included in labour |
| Limited access, beam > 150 kg | Franna crane (pick-and-carry) | $800 - $2,500 (half day) |
| Very tight access, upper level | Mini crane or telehandler | $1,200 - $3,500 |
| No ground access (e.g., terrace house) | Hiab truck (crane on truck) | $600 - $1,500 |
| Long beam over house (new build/extension) | Mobile crane | $1,500 - $4,000+ |

**Weather considerations:** Steel beam lifting operations must be suspended in high winds (typically > 40 km/h). Rain can make beams slippery and site conditions unsafe. Schedule crane hire with weather contingency.

### 5.3.2 Beam Lifting and Positioning

Once on site, the beam must be lifted into its final position. For a typical load-bearing wall removal:

1. **Temporary propping is checked** — all props are confirmed tight and bearing correctly
2. **The load-bearing wall (or section of it) is removed** — this is demolition scope, but must be coordinated with the structural installer
3. **Beam is lifted into position** — either manually or by crane, the beam is placed onto its bearing points (posts, columns, or remaining wall sections)
4. **Beam is temporarily secured** — clamped or braced in position while permanent connections are made
5. **Level and alignment are checked** — the beam must be level, plumb, and correctly positioned per the engineering drawings

**Manual handling compliance:** Under Australian WHS (Work Health & Safety) legislation, manual handling of heavy beams must comply with model Code of Practice for Hazardous Manual Tasks. Any beam requiring more than 2 workers to lift requires a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) and risk assessment.

### 5.3.3 Post Installation

If the beam design requires new support posts (columns), these must be installed with:

- **Post material:** Steel SHS (Square Hollow Section) or CHS (Circular Hollow Section) columns are most common. Timber posts (hardwood or engineered) may also be specified
- **Base plate and fixing:** Steel posts are welded to a base plate which is chemical-anchored or cast into a concrete pad footing
- **Top connection:** The post-to-beam connection is typically a bolted cleat plate, welded connection, or proprietary bracket per the engineer's drawings
- **Footing:** New posts require a concrete pad footing designed to AS 2870. The engineer specifies footing dimensions based on soil classification and loads. Typical residential pad footings are 600mm x 600mm x 300mm deep minimum, but vary significantly by soil type

**AS 2870 soil classification and footing impact:**

| Site Classification | Soil Type | Footing Complexity |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Class A | Sand, rock, stable non-reactive | Simple pad footing |
| Class S | Slightly reactive clay | Standard pad footing |
| Class M | Moderately reactive clay | Deeper pad footing, possibly bored pier |
| Class H1/H2 | Highly reactive clay | Engineer-designed, possibly bored pier to depth |
| Class E | Extremely reactive | Specialist engineering required |
| Class P | Problem sites (fill, soft clay, mine subsidence) | Specialist investigation required |

### 5.3.4 Connection and Fixing

All structural connections must be made exactly as specified in the engineer's drawings. Common connection types in residential structural work:

| Connection Type | Typical Application | Key Requirements |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Bolted cleat plate** | Beam-to-post, beam-to-existing structure | Bolt grade (typically 8.8), torque specification, minimum edge distances per AS 4100 |
| **Welded connection** | Steel beam-to-steel post (fabricated off-site) | Must be done by qualified welder; weld category per AS/NZS 1554 |
| **Chemical anchor** | Post base plate to existing concrete slab | Anchor brand, embedment depth, cure time per manufacturer specs |
| **Coach bolts / through-bolts** | Beam bearing on timber or masonry | Bolt size, washer plates, minimum bearing lengths |
| **Proprietary brackets** | LVL/glulam beam connections | Manufacturer-specified fixings (e.g., MiTek, Pryda) |

**Relevant Australian Standards for connections:**
- **AS 4100:2020** — Steel Structures (design and connections)
- **AS/NZS 1554** — Structural Steel Welding
- **AS/NZS 3679.1** — Hot-rolled Structural Steel Bars and Sections (material grade)
- **AS 1720.1:2010** — Timber Structures (for LVL/glulam connections)

**NCC requirement (Part 6.3 / formerly Part 3.4.4):** Joists, bearers, and lintels must be restrained from lateral movement or twisting along their length. End supports must transfer loads to footings with a bearing distance not less than the width of the member for single spans, and not less than twice the width for continuous spans at internal bearings.

- [Practical Engineering - AS 4100](https://practicalengineering.com.au/as-4100/)

### 5.3.5 Inspection by Building Certifier (MANDATORY HOLD POINT)

**This is the most critical step in the entire structural work sequence.**

After the beam, posts, and connections are installed, the building certifier (building surveyor) must inspect the work before it is concealed. This is a **mandatory hold point** — work cannot legally continue past this stage until the certifier has signed off.

**What the certifier inspects:**
- Beam size and grade matches the approved engineering drawings
- Post locations match the drawings
- Connection details (bolt sizes, bracket types, weld quality) match the specification
- Bearing lengths are adequate
- Beam is level and correctly positioned
- Temporary propping is still in place (props typically remain until the certifier approves removal)
- Footings for new posts are constructed correctly (may have been inspected separately at the footing pour stage)

**State-specific mandatory inspection requirements:**

| State | Inspection Stage Name | Key Reference |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|
| **NSW** | Critical Stage Inspection — "prior to the covering of any framework for any floor, wall, roof or other building element" | Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation |
| **Victoria** | Mandatory Notification Stage — Frame stage inspection | VBA Practice Note MI 01 |
| **Queensland** | Frame Stage Inspection — one of four mandatory prescribed stages | Building Regulation 2021 |
| **All states** | Structural frame must be inspected before lining (plasterboard) is installed | NCC Volume 2 |

**What happens if the inspection fails:**
- The certifier issues a direction notice specifying what must be corrected
- No downstream work can proceed until corrections are made and re-inspected
- Common failure reasons: wrong bolt grade, missing connection plate, beam bearing too short, post not plumb, footing undersized
- The structural engineer may need to be called back to review and confirm any changes

**Typical certifier inspection fees:**

| Inspection Type | Typical Fee (AUD, excl. GST) |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Single structural inspection (residential) | $250 - $500 |
| Multiple-stage inspection package | $1,500 - $3,500 |
| Re-inspection (if initial inspection fails) | $200 - $400 |

## 5.4 What Happens AFTER Structural Work

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 5.4.1 Remove Temporary Propping

Once the structural beam is installed, inspected, and certified by the building certifier, the temporary propping can be removed. **Props must NOT be removed before the certifier has approved the structural work.**

Removal sequence:
1. Certifier confirms beam installation is compliant
2. Structural engineer confirms (if required by their design notes) that props can be removed
3. Props are removed carefully, checking for any deflection or movement
4. Props are returned to the hire company

**Important timing note:** In some cases, the engineer may specify that props remain in place for a period after beam installation (e.g., if chemical anchors need to cure, or if a concrete footing needs to reach design strength — typically 7-28 days). This must be factored into the project schedule.

### 5.4.2 Framing Around Beam (Bulkhead)

After the structural beam is in place and certified, the carpenter frames around it to create a "bulkhead" (a boxed-in section of ceiling that conceals the beam). This is carpentry scope, not structural scope.

**Bulkhead framing involves:**
- Timber framing (usually 70x35mm or 90x35mm pine) built around the beam
- The bulkhead frame is fixed to the ceiling joists and wall frames
- Plasterboard is then fixed to the bulkhead frame by the plasterer
- The plasterer finishes with joints, cornice, and sanding
- The painter paints the bulkhead to match the ceiling

**Alternative to bulkhead:** If the ceiling is being lowered or a new ceiling installed, the beam may be fully concealed within the ceiling void. This is the preferred aesthetic outcome but requires sufficient ceiling height. An exposed steel beam (painted or raw) is another design option that eliminates bulkhead work.

**Who does what:**

| Task | Trade Responsible |
|------|-------------------|
| Beam installation | Structural steelworker / builder |
| Bulkhead framing | Carpenter |
| Plasterboard lining of bulkhead | Plasterer |
| Cornice and finishing | Plasterer |
| Painting | Painter |

### 5.4.3 Other Trades Can Proceed

Once the beam is in place and certified, the following work can commence:

1. **Framing / carpentry** — new wall frames can be erected, ceiling joists installed, and any new structural timber work completed
2. **Plumbing rough-in** — pipes can be run through the new layout
3. **Electrical rough-in** — cables can be run through frames and ceiling cavity
4. **HVAC ductwork** — ducts can be routed around or through the new structure
5. **Insulation** — after all rough-in trades are complete
6. **Plasterboard / lining** — after all rough-in inspections pass

## 5.5 Coordination with Other Trades

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 5.5.1 Structural + Demolition

| Coordination Point | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Asbestos audit before demolition** | Must be completed before any wall removal. Structural work cannot begin until asbestos is cleared |
| **Demolition sequence** | Non-structural elements removed first (linings, fixtures), then load-bearing elements removed under propping |
| **Temporary propping** | Must be installed BEFORE any load-bearing demolition. The demolition contractor and structural installer must agree on propping plan |
| **Debris clearance** | All demolition debris must be removed from the structural work zone before beam delivery |
| **Services disconnection** | Electrical circuits and plumbing services in the demolition zone must be isolated/disconnected before demolition |

### 5.5.2 Structural + Carpentry

| Coordination Point | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Beam position affects framing** | New wall frames must be designed around the beam location. Carpentry drawings should reference the structural drawings |
| **Bulkhead dimensions** | The carpenter needs to know the exact beam depth and width to frame the bulkhead correctly |
| **Nogging and blocking** | The carpenter may need to install timber nogging around the beam for plasterboard fixing |
| **Ceiling joist connections** | Where ceiling joists connect to or bear on the new beam, the connection detail must match the engineer's specification |
| **Sequencing** | Structural beam first, then carpentry framing. Carpenter cannot start framing in the beam zone until the certifier has signed off |

### 5.5.3 Structural + Plumbing

| Coordination Point | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Existing services** | Plumbing services in the wall being removed must be relocated BEFORE or DURING demolition. The plumber must disconnect and cap off services before the wall comes out |
| **New beam may block pipe runs** | A deep beam may obstruct planned plumbing routes. The plumber should review structural drawings before finalising pipe runs |
| **Hot water / gas relocation** | If gas or hot water services pass through the structural zone, these must be relocated — often requiring separate plumbing scope |
| **Sewer and drainage** | Underground drainage is rarely affected by above-ground structural work, but new post footings must not conflict with drainage lines |

### 5.5.4 Structural + Electrical

| Coordination Point | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Circuit isolation** | The electrician must identify and isolate all circuits in the demolition/structural zone before work begins |
| **Cable rerouting** | Circuits that pass through the wall being removed must be rerouted. This may involve running new cables through alternative routes |
| **Beam may block cable routes** | A steel beam cannot have holes drilled through it without engineer approval. Cables must route around beams, which may add cable length and complexity |
| **Switchboard access** | Structural work should not block access to the main switchboard. If the switchboard is in the structural zone, temporary power arrangements are needed |

### 5.5.5 Structural + Concrete / Footings

| Coordination Point | Detail |
|-------------------|--------|
| **New post footings** | If new posts require new pad footings, the concrete work must be done and cured BEFORE the beam is installed. Concrete typically requires 7 days minimum cure before loading (28 days for full design strength) |
| **Footing inspection** | The certifier may require a separate footing inspection before the concrete is poured (to check reinforcement and dimensions). This is a separate hold point |
| **Existing slab penetration** | If a post base plate is being fixed to an existing concrete slab, the slab must be assessed for adequacy. Core drilling through post-tensioned slabs requires specialist engineering |
| **Underpinning** | If existing footings are found to be inadequate, underpinning may be required — this is specialist structural/civil work |

---

## 5.6 Critical Path Implications

**Confidence: HIGH**

Structural work is almost always on the **critical path** of a renovation project. A delay in structural work cascades through every subsequent trade.

### Typical Structural Work Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Structural engineering design | 1-3 weeks | Depends on complexity and engineer availability |
| Building approval (CDC pathway) | 3-10 business days | Via private certifier |
| Building approval (DA pathway) | 4-12 weeks | Via council — significantly slower |
| Beam fabrication and delivery | 1-3 weeks | Steel beams may need cutting, drilling, or welding off-site |
| Temporary propping installation | 0.5-1 day | Typically done by builder or prop hire company |
| Demolition of load-bearing element | 0.5-1 day | Must be done carefully under propping |
| Beam installation and connection | 1-2 days | Depends on complexity, access, and number of beams |
| Certifier inspection | 1-3 days wait | Depends on certifier availability |
| Propping removal | 0.5 day | After certifier sign-off |

**Total elapsed time (engineering to propping removal): 4-18 weeks**

Most of this time is pre-construction (engineering and approvals). The physical structural work typically takes 2-4 days on site.

### Common Causes of Structural Delays

| Delay Cause | Typical Impact | How to Avoid |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Engineer drawings not ready | 1-4 weeks delay | Engage engineer as early as possible in the project |
| Council DA taking longer than expected | 2-8 weeks delay | Use CDC pathway where possible |
| Beam not available (steel supply chain) | 1-3 weeks delay | Order beam as soon as engineer specifies it |
| Certifier not available for inspection | 2-7 days delay | Book certifier in advance; confirm availability |
| Inspection fails (non-compliant work) | 1-2 weeks delay | Ensure installer follows drawings exactly |
| Weather delays (crane lift not possible) | 1-5 days delay | Schedule crane with weather contingency days |
| Asbestos discovered during demolition | 1-3 weeks delay | Do asbestos audit before demolition begins |
| Existing conditions differ from assumptions | 1-4 weeks delay | Engineer should inspect after demolition, before beam order |
| Post footing concrete curing | 7-28 days wait | Pour footings as early as possible in the sequence |

### Downstream Impact of Structural Delays

Every day of structural delay pushes back:
- Carpentry framing (cannot frame until beam is certified)
- Plumbing rough-in (cannot run pipes until framing is in)
- Electrical rough-in (cannot run cables until framing is in)
- Plasterboard (cannot line until all rough-ins are inspected)
- Every subsequent trade from tiling through to painting and handover

**Rule of thumb:** A 1-week structural delay typically causes a 1-2 week overall project delay (due to cascading trade scheduling impacts and the need to rebook subsequent trades).

---

## 5.7 Structural Work Duration by Project Type

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (durations are typical ranges and vary significantly by site conditions)

| Project Type | Typical Structural Scope | On-Site Duration |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Kitchen renovation** (wall removal) | 1 beam, 1-2 posts, propping | 1-2 days |
| **Bathroom renovation** | Rarely structural (unless removing walls) | 0-1 day |
| **Open-plan conversion** (multiple walls) | 2-4 beams, multiple posts | 2-4 days |
| **Second storey addition** | Multiple beams, new load paths, upgraded footings | 1-2 weeks |
| **Extension** | New beams, footings, connections to existing structure | 3-7 days |
| **Deck / pergola** (structural) | Posts, bearers, connections | 1-3 days |

---

## 5.8 Key Takeaways for Scope Generator

### Sequencing Logic
1. Structural work happens after demolition, before framing
2. Engineering drawings and building approval must exist before work starts
3. Temporary propping must be in place before any load-bearing demolition
4. Certifier inspection is a mandatory hold point — flag this in every structural scope
5. Props are removed only after certifier approval

### Scope Document Generation
1. Always specify that structural engineer drawings are a prerequisite
2. Always include the certifier inspection as a line item (even if the fee is excluded from the structural scope)
3. Note whether temporary propping is included or excluded from the structural scope
4. Note whether crane hire is included or excluded
5. Include coordination notes about which other trades need to work before/after structural
6. Specify that all connections must be made per the engineer's drawings — no substitutions without engineer approval

### Duration Estimates
1. Physical structural work: 1-4 days for typical residential renovation
2. Pre-construction lead time: 4-12 weeks (engineering + approvals)
3. Allow 1-3 days for certifier inspection scheduling
