## 1. Load-Bearing Wall Removal

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented across Australian engineering firms and building codes)

### 1.1 What Is a Load-Bearing Wall?

A load-bearing wall (also called a structural wall) carries loads from above — roof, ceiling, upper floors — and transfers them down through the structure to the footings/foundations. Removing one without installing an alternative support (typically a steel or engineered timber beam) can cause partial or complete structural failure.

### 1.2 How to Identify a Load-Bearing Wall

No single indicator is definitive. A structural engineer must confirm, but these are strong indicators:

| Indicator | What to Look For | Likelihood of Load-Bearing |
|---|---|---|
| **Joist/rafter direction** | Wall runs perpendicular to ceiling joists or roof rafters above | HIGH — joists landing on the wall transfer load through it |
| **Parallel to ridge line** | Wall runs parallel to and below the roof ridge, near the centre of the house | HIGH — often the main internal bearing wall |
| **Stacked walls (two-storey)** | A wall on the ground floor sits directly below a wall on the first floor | HIGH — upper wall loads transfer through the lower wall |
| **External walls** | All perimeter walls of the house | VERY HIGH — almost always load-bearing (carry roof loads to footings) |
| **Central walls** | Walls near the centre of the building, especially in older homes with roof spans > 4m | HIGH — needed to limit rafter/joist span lengths |
| **Wall thickness** | Wall is thicker than standard partition walls (> 90mm stud for timber frame) | MEDIUM — thicker walls may carry greater loads |
| **Top plate configuration** | Double top plate visible in roof space (two layers of timber on top of the wall) | MEDIUM-HIGH — double top plates are common on load-bearing walls |
| **Cyclone rods/tie-downs** | Metal rods or straps connecting top plate down to slab or bearers (visible in roof space or subfloor) | HIGH — tie-downs are installed on structural walls |
| **Braces bearing on wall** | Roof braces or struts landing on the wall top plate | HIGH — the wall is supporting those brace loads |
| **Concrete block (masonry)** | Internal masonry walls, especially in older brick homes | HIGH — masonry internal walls were commonly structural |

### 1.3 Australian-Specific Construction Patterns

| House Type | Common Load-Bearing Configuration |
|---|---|
| **Timber-framed weatherboard (pre-1960)** | External walls + one or two internal walls running the length of the house. Typically bearer-and-joist subfloor with stumps. Central walls often sit on central bearers |
| **Double-brick (1950s-1980s)** | Both leaves of external walls are structural. Internal brick walls are commonly load-bearing. Cavity ties connect leaves |
| **Brick veneer (1960s-present)** | Internal timber frame is structural (carries roof loads). External brick is non-structural cladding. Internal plasterboard walls may or may not be structural |
| **Slab-on-ground (modern)** | External walls load-bearing. Internal walls may be load-bearing depending on roof span and truss design. Many modern trusses span the full width, making internal walls non-load-bearing — but NOT always |

### 1.4 What Happens During Removal

1. **Structural engineer assessment** — engineer inspects the wall, roof space, subfloor, and reviews plans
2. **Engineering design** — engineer designs a replacement beam (steel UB, engineered timber LVL, or reinforced concrete) with posts/columns at each end, sized to carry the same loads the wall carried
3. **Temporary propping** — before removing the wall, temporary props (acrow props/adjustable steel props) are installed to support the structure above
4. **Wall demolition** — wall framing, brickwork, or masonry is removed
5. **Beam installation** — the new beam and posts are installed, with connections to the structure above and load path down to footings
6. **Footing check** — the point loads from the new posts may require new or upgraded footings (the wall spread the load evenly; the posts concentrate it at points)
7. **Make good** — ceiling, floor, and wall linings are repaired around the new beam

### 1.5 Regulatory Requirements

- **Structural engineer's drawings and calculations** are mandatory for any load-bearing wall removal
- **Building permit / approval** is required in all states (this is structural work that affects the building's integrity)
- **Building certifier inspection** of the beam installation is required before it is concealed by linings
- **Non-compliance consequences:** Fines, mandatory rectification, insurance voiding, issues at resale (building inspections will identify unpermitted structural work)

**Scope impact:** Every renovation that removes a wall between rooms (e.g., kitchen-to-living open-plan conversion) needs a structural engineering line item. Budget $1,000-$2,500 for engineering design and $3,000-$10,000+ for the physical wall removal and beam installation.

## 2. Load-Bearing Wall Modification

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 2.1 When Does Modifying (Not Removing) a Wall Need Engineering?

You don't have to fully remove a wall to trigger structural requirements. Any of these modifications to a load-bearing wall require a structural engineer:

| Modification | Why Engineering Is Needed |
|---|---|
| **New doorway in a load-bearing wall** | A lintel (beam above the opening) must be designed to carry the load over the new opening |
| **Widening an existing doorway** | The existing lintel is sized for the original opening width. A wider opening needs a longer lintel, which carries more load and may deflect more |
| **New window opening** | Same as doorway — a lintel must span the opening and transfer loads to the wall sections either side (jamb studs) |
| **Removing a section of wall (e.g., creating a servery/pass-through)** | Partial removal still interrupts the load path. A beam must span the opening |
| **Moving a doorway** | The old opening can be filled (new studs + nogging), but the new opening needs a properly designed lintel |
| **Cutting a wall down to half-height (pony wall / knee wall)** | Changes the structural behaviour of the wall. The remaining half-wall may need bracing design |

### 2.2 Lintel Specifications

Under AS 1684 (Residential Timber-Framed Construction), lintels over openings in load-bearing walls must be sized according to span tables based on:

- **Opening width** (span)
- **Load width** (how much roof/floor the lintel supports — measured as the distance between the opening centreline and the nearest parallel support, divided by 2)
- **Roof type** (tile vs. metal — tile is heavier)
- **Storey** (single vs. upper storey of two-storey)

Common lintel materials:

| Material | Typical Application |
|---|---|
| **Hardwood timber** | Openings up to ~1.8m in single-storey with light roof |
| **LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber)** | Openings up to ~2.4m, commonly 90mm or 130mm wide |
| **Steel lintel (angle or flat bar)** | Openings in masonry walls |
| **Steel UB (Universal Beam)** | Larger openings (> 2.4m) or heavy loads |
| **Steel PFC (Parallel Flange Channel)** | Where a flush beam is needed (beam within the wall depth) |

**Scope impact:** Widening a doorway from 820mm to 1200mm in a load-bearing wall requires engineering design. This is a common scope item in kitchen and bathroom renovations where the homeowner wants a wider entrance.

## 3. Non-Load-Bearing Wall Removal

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.1 Do Non-Load-Bearing Walls Ever Need Structural Input?

**Yes — in two important scenarios:**

#### Bracing Walls

Even if a wall carries no vertical load from above, it may function as a **bracing wall** (also called a racking wall). Bracing walls resist horizontal forces — primarily **wind loads** and, in some areas, **earthquake loads**.

Under the NCC and AS 1684, residential buildings must have minimum bracing capacity in each direction. This bracing is typically provided by:

- Plasterboard-lined walls (fixed with specific nailing patterns — "nominal bracing")
- Structural plywood-sheathed walls ("structural bracing")
- Diagonal steel or timber braces within the wall frame
- Metal strap bracing

**The risk:** Removing a non-load-bearing wall that provides bracing can reduce the building's capacity to resist lateral (horizontal) forces below the minimum required by the NCC. This can make the building non-compliant and unsafe in high winds or earthquakes.

| Scenario | Bracing Concern |
|---|---|
| Removing an internal wall in a wide, open-plan area | Removing bracing from the middle of a large floor area may leave insufficient bracing along that wall line |
| Removing a wall parallel to the building's long axis | May reduce bracing capacity in the short (cross) direction, which is typically the more critical direction |
| High wind region (N3, N4, C1-C3) | Bracing requirements are higher; losing one bracing wall has a bigger impact |
| Earthquake zones (AS 1170.4) | Some parts of Australia have earthquake design requirements that rely on bracing walls |

**ACT Government Construction Note** (Access Canberra) explicitly states that bracing must be provided to enable roof, wall, and floor framing to resist horizontal (racking) forces, and that all wall removals should consider bracing implications.

#### Fire-Rated Walls

In some situations (e.g., attached townhouses, granny flats close to boundaries), walls between dwellings or close to property boundaries may be fire-rated. Removing a fire-rated wall has regulatory implications beyond structural engineering.

### 3.2 What Does a Structural Engineer Do for Non-Load-Bearing Walls?

A structural engineer assessing a non-load-bearing wall removal will:

1. **Confirm the wall is genuinely non-load-bearing** (the primary reason to engage them)
2. **Check whether the wall provides bracing** and calculate the remaining bracing capacity
3. **If bracing is lost**, design alternative bracing solutions (e.g., relocating bracing to another wall, adding structural plywood sheathing to an adjacent wall, installing a steel portal frame)
4. **Issue a structural certificate** confirming the wall is safe to remove

**Scope impact:** Even non-load-bearing wall removal should include a structural engineer assessment line item. The assessment is faster and cheaper ($300-$800) than a full beam design, but it protects the homeowner and builder from removing a bracing wall unknowingly.

---

## 4. Floor Modifications

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 4.1 Concrete Slab Modifications

Any modification to an existing concrete slab on ground or suspended concrete slab requires structural engineering:

| Modification | Why Engineering Is Required |
|---|---|
| **Cutting an opening in a slab** (e.g., for a new staircase, lift shaft, or plumbing penetration) | The slab's structural continuity is broken. Reinforcement is cut. New transfer beams must be designed to frame the opening and redistribute loads to adjacent supports |
| **Core holes for new plumbing** | Small penetrations (< 150mm diameter) through a slab on ground may not need engineering. Larger penetrations or penetrations through suspended slabs do |
| **Lowering a floor level** (e.g., for a sunken lounge or step-down bathroom) | Slab depth is reduced, weakening it. The transition between levels creates a structural discontinuity |
| **Adding a step-down for a wet area** | Bathroom and laundry renovations often require a hob or step-down for waterproofing falls. If the existing slab is modified (chased out or set down), engineering may be needed to confirm the remaining slab depth is adequate |
| **Removing a section of slab** (e.g., to install in-ground services) | Structural integrity of remaining slab must be confirmed |

### 4.2 Timber Floor Modifications

| Modification | Why Engineering Is Required |
|---|---|
| **Removing floor joists** (e.g., for a staircase opening) | Remaining joists must carry additional load. Trimming beams around the opening must be designed |
| **Changing floor levels** | New bearers and joists at the different level need design to ensure load paths work |
| **Adding heavy loads** (e.g., stone benchtop on an island, freestanding bath, large planter) | Point loads on timber floors need checking against joist capacity (AS 1684 span tables) |
| **Converting subfloor to habitable space** | Changes the floor classification and may require upgraded floor structure for increased live loads |

### 4.3 Key Australian Standard

**AS 3600:2018 — Concrete Structures** governs the structural design of all reinforced concrete elements (slabs, beams, columns, footings) in Australia. For slab modifications, the engineer must assess the existing reinforcement (using ground-penetrating radar if drawings are unavailable) and design any strengthening required.

**AS 1684 — Residential Timber-Framed Construction** provides span tables and design criteria for timber floor joists and bearers.

**Scope impact:** Any renovation involving bathroom relocation (new waste pipes through slab), staircase installation, or floor level changes should include a structural engineering assessment. Budget $800-$2,000 for engineering on floor modifications.

---

## 5. Roof Modifications

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.1 Converting to a Raked (Vaulted/Cathedral) Ceiling

This is one of the most structurally significant changes in a renovation. Here's why:

In a conventional roof, **ceiling joists** (the horizontal timbers that your ceiling plasterboard is fixed to) serve a critical structural function: they act as **ties** that prevent the rafters from pushing the external walls outward. Remove the ceiling joists and the roof can spread, pushing the walls apart.

| Roof Type | Impact of Removing Ceiling for Raked Ceiling |
|---|---|
| **Conventional rafter roof** | Ceiling joists tie the rafter feet together. Removing them requires either: (a) a structural ridge beam at the peak to carry the roof load (the rafters become simply-supported beams), or (b) collar ties at a higher level (partial rake), or (c) steel portal frames or similar to resist the spreading forces |
| **Truss roof** | Individual trusses are engineered as complete units. You CANNOT cut or remove members of a truss without the truss manufacturer or a structural engineer redesigning the truss. The bottom chord (which forms the ceiling) is a critical tension member. Cutting it causes truss failure |

**Key rule:** Building codes prohibit any field modification (cutting, notching, drilling) of manufactured roof trusses without approval from the truss manufacturer or a structural engineer.

### 5.2 Skylight Installation

| Scenario | Engineering Required? |
|---|---|
| **Small skylight between rafters/trusses** (fits within the gap, no cutting of structural members) | Generally NO engineering required, but must comply with manufacturer's installation instructions and weatherproofing requirements |
| **Skylight wider than one rafter/truss spacing** (requires cutting one or more rafters or truss top chords) | YES — structural engineer must design trimming around the opening. Cut rafters must be supported by trimmer beams carried by doubled-up rafters on each side |
| **Multiple skylights in the same roof plane** | YES — cumulative effect of multiple openings on roof diaphragm action and bracing capacity |
| **Large skylight or roof window** (> 900mm wide) | YES — significant opening requires engineering design |

### 5.3 Other Roof Modifications Requiring Engineering

| Modification | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Raising the roofline** | Entire roof structure changes. New engineering required |
| **Changing roof material** (e.g., concrete tile to metal) | Changes dead load on the structure. If going from heavy to light, wind uplift becomes more critical. If going from light to heavy, existing rafters/trusses may be undersized |
| **Adding a dormer** | Cuts through the existing roof structure and adds new loads. Full engineering required |
| **Solar panel installation (large arrays)** | May be fine on modern roofs designed for tile loads, but older, lighter roofs may need checking for the additional dead load and wind load |

**Scope impact:** Any renovation involving ceiling removal (raked ceiling conversions are very popular in kitchen-living renovations) requires structural engineering. Budget $2,000-$5,000 for the engineering design alone.

## 6. Second Storey Additions

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 6.1 Why Existing Structures Need Assessment

Adding a second storey approximately **doubles the load** on the existing ground-floor structure and footings. The original house was designed for single-storey loads only.

| Element | Assessment Required |
|---|---|
| **Footings** | Were designed for single-storey loads. Must be assessed for adequacy. Older strip footings (300-450mm deep) are often inadequate and need underpinning or new footings |
| **Slab** | If slab on ground, it must be assessed for the concentrated loads from new posts/columns that transfer upper-storey loads down. Edge beams and internal thickenings may need reinforcement |
| **Ground-floor walls** | Must be assessed for increased compression (vertical load) and bracing (horizontal load from the upper storey). Existing studs may need sistering (doubling up) or replacement with larger members |
| **Ground-floor bearers and joists** (if timber-framed) | Existing bearers may be undersized for the additional loads from above. Stumps may need replacement or additional stumps added |
| **Soil** | A **geotechnical (soil) report** is required. The soil must be classified under AS 2870 (Residential Slabs and Footings) to determine if existing footings are adequate. Reactive clay soils (Class H, E, or P) are particularly problematic |

### 6.2 Soil Report Requirements

A geotechnical investigation is the first step for any second-storey addition. The report classifies the site:

| Site Classification (AS 2870) | Soil Type | Implications for Second Storey |
|---|---|---|
| **Class A** | Most sand and rock sites (little or no movement) | Existing footings may be adequate with minor modifications |
| **Class S** | Slightly reactive clay | Existing strip footings may be adequate if deep enough |
| **Class M** | Moderately reactive clay | Footings likely need deepening or widening. Underpinning probable |
| **Class H** | Highly reactive clay | Underpinning almost certain. Significant footing upgrades required |
| **Class E** | Extremely reactive clay | Major footing work required. May need piled footings |
| **Class P** | Problem sites (soft, fill, landslip) | Specialist engineering required. Case-by-case |

**Cost:** Soil report costs $800-$1,500 and takes approximately 2 weeks.

### 6.3 Common Footing Upgrades

| Method | Description | Typical Cost Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Underpinning** (mass concrete) | Excavate beneath existing footings in sections, pour deeper concrete pads | $15,000-$40,000 |
| **Screw piles** | Steel screw-in piles installed adjacent to existing footings to carry new loads | $10,000-$30,000 |
| **New pad footings** | For new post/column locations that don't coincide with existing footings | $2,000-$8,000 |
| **Slab thickening** | Additional concrete poured to thicken slab at new load points | $3,000-$10,000 |

**Scope impact:** A second-storey addition requires a full structural engineering package: soil report + structural design + footing design + framing design. Engineering fees for a full second-storey addition range from $5,000-$15,000+.

---

## 7. Underpinning

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 7.1 When Is Underpinning Required?

Underpinning is the process of strengthening or deepening existing footings. It is required in these scenarios:

| Scenario | Why Underpinning Is Needed |
|---|---|
| **Differential settlement** | One part of the foundation has settled more than another, causing cracks in walls, doors sticking, floors sloping. The settled footings need stabilising |
| **Adding a second storey** | Existing footings designed for single-storey loads are insufficient for the additional weight. Footings must be deepened or widened |
| **Deepening a basement or subfloor** | Excavating below the existing footing level undermines the foundations. Footings must be extended deeper before excavation proceeds |
| **Adjacent excavation** | Neighbouring construction (new basement, pool, retaining wall) excavates near your footings, potentially undermining them |
| **Reactive clay movement** | In areas with highly reactive clay soils (common in Melbourne, Adelaide, western Sydney), seasonal soil movement can cause progressive footing damage |
| **Tree root damage** | Large trees near footings can cause soil drying and shrinkage (especially eucalyptus species), leading to settlement |
| **Change of use** | Converting a garage to habitable space may trigger footing upgrade requirements to meet residential footing standards |

### 7.2 Signs That Existing Footings Are Failing

| Sign | Severity |
|---|---|
| **Hairline cracks in plaster** (< 1mm) | Minor — may be cosmetic (thermal/shrinkage). Monitor |
| **Cracks 1-5mm** | Moderate — possible differential settlement. Engineering assessment recommended |
| **Cracks > 5mm** | Significant — likely structural movement. Urgent engineering assessment required |
| **Doors/windows sticking or not closing** | Moderate-Significant — indicates frame distortion from movement |
| **Sloping floors** (> 10mm over 2m) | Significant — indicates differential settlement |
| **Cracks in external brickwork** (stepped diagonal pattern) | Significant — classic sign of differential settlement |
| **Gaps between walls and ceiling/floor** | Significant — structure is separating |

### 7.3 Underpinning Methods Used in Australia

| Method | How It Works | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Mass concrete underpinning** | Excavate beneath existing footing in alternating sections (typically 1m segments), pour new deeper concrete pad. Repeat in sequence along the wall | Traditional method. Works well for strip footings on stable soil |
| **Screw piles (helical piles)** | Steel screw-in piles installed adjacent to existing footings, with a bracket connecting to the existing footing to transfer loads to deeper, more stable soil | Reactive clay, soft soils. Less disruption than mass concrete. No wet concrete curing time |
| **Resin injection** | Expanding structural resin injected into the soil beneath the footing to compact, stabilise, and lift the foundation | Minor settlement correction. Less invasive. Works well for slab-on-ground |
| **Mini piles / micropiles** | Small-diameter piles drilled through or adjacent to existing footings down to load-bearing strata | Where deep bearing is needed (rock or dense sand at depth) |

**Scope impact:** Underpinning is a major cost item when required. It is not a standard renovation scope item but must be flagged when the renovation involves second-storey additions, basement conversion, or when site inspection reveals settlement symptoms. Budget $10,000-$40,000+ depending on extent.

## 8. Retaining Walls

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 8.1 When Do Retaining Walls Need Engineering?

Retaining walls hold back soil. When they fail, the consequences are serious — soil collapse, property damage, potential injury. Engineering requirements vary by state, but general thresholds are:

| State/Territory | Height Threshold for Engineering / Permit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **New South Wales** | > 600mm requires development approval. Engineering required for walls > 600mm | Measured from finished ground level on the low side to the top of the retained soil |
| **Queensland** | > 1m requires building approval. Must also be > 1.5m from any building, structure, or other retaining wall | Brisbane City Council has specific local requirements |
| **Victoria** | > 1m generally requires a building permit | Permit triggers engineering requirement |
| **Western Australia** | > 500mm requires a building permit | Stricter threshold than most states. Must adhere to engineering requirements set by WA government |
| **South Australia** | > 1m requires building approval | Similar to Victoria and Queensland |
| **Tasmania** | > 1m generally requires approval | Check with local council |
| **ACT** | > 600mm may require approval | Similar to NSW threshold |
| **Northern Territory** | > 1m generally requires approval | Check with local council |

### 8.2 Additional Factors That Trigger Engineering

Even below the height thresholds above, engineering may be required if:

| Factor | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Surcharge loading** | Vehicles, structures, or stored materials on top of the retained soil add extra load the wall must resist |
| **Proximity to buildings** | A retaining wall near a building's footings affects the stability of both. Engineering must address the interaction |
| **Proximity to boundaries** | Walls near property boundaries may need engineering for council approval and to protect neighbouring properties |
| **Tiered walls** | Multiple retaining walls stepped up a slope have cumulative effects. The lower wall may need to resist loads from the upper wall |
| **Water/drainage** | Poor drainage behind a retaining wall dramatically increases the load (hydrostatic pressure). Engineering must include drainage design |
| **Soil type** | Reactive clays, sandy soils, and filled ground all affect wall design |

### 8.3 Common Retaining Wall Types in Residential Renovations

| Type | Max Height (without engineering) | Engineering Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Concrete sleeper** (with steel posts) | Varies by state (see above) | Per state thresholds |
| **Concrete block (besser block)** | Varies by state | Always needs engineering if reinforced |
| **Poured concrete (reinforced)** | N/A | Always engineered |
| **Timber crib wall** | Varies by state | Per state thresholds |
| **Gabion basket** | Varies by state | Per state thresholds |
| **Boulder wall** | Low walls only (< 600mm) | Limited structural capacity; engineering recommended for any significant height |

**Scope impact:** Outdoor renovations involving level changes, landscaping on sloped blocks, or new structures near boundaries should include a retaining wall engineering line item if the retained height exceeds the state threshold. Budget $1,000-$3,000 for engineering design.

---

## 9. Deck and Pergola Connections

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 9.1 When Does Attaching to the House Need Engineering?

The NCC (Volume Two, Part 3.10.6 — Attachment of Decks and Balconies to External Walls) sets specific requirements for when a deck or balcony is attached to an existing building:

| Scenario | Engineering Required? |
|---|---|
| **Freestanding deck** (not attached to the house, self-supporting) | Not typically for the connection to the house (no connection exists). Still needs to comply with AS 1684 span tables for member sizing and NCC for balustrades |
| **Deck attached to a timber-framed wall** (ledger board bolted to framing) | Engineering required if: the deck live load exceeds 2 kPa, the deck is above 1m from ground, or the span/size is outside AS 1684 span tables |
| **Deck attached to a masonry veneer wall** | YES — the NCC requires that attachment to a masonry veneer wall must be designed by a professional engineer. The ledger must be fixed through the masonry to the structural timber frame behind, not just to the brick |
| **Deck attached to a full masonry (double brick) wall** | YES — engineer must design the connection to ensure loads are transferred properly into the masonry and down to footings |
| **Deck above 1m from ground** (regardless of attachment method) | Requires building approval in most states. Balustrade design required (min 1m height, max 125mm gap between balusters per AS 1170.1) |
| **Pergola/verandah attached to fascia board** | YES — the NCC states that if a roofed structure is connected to a fascia, it must be connected in accordance with an engineer's specifications. Fascia boards are not designed to carry structural loads |
| **Pergola/verandah attached to house wall** | Engineering required if the structure transfers significant wind uplift or lateral loads to the house. Connections must resist both downward (gravity) and upward (wind uplift) forces |
| **Carport attached to house** | Almost always requires engineering. Wind uplift loads on a carport roof are significant |

### 9.2 Key Standards

- **AS 1684** — Residential Timber-Framed Construction (span tables for deck joists, bearers, posts)
- **AS/NZS 1170.1** — Structural Design Actions Part 1: Permanent, imposed and other actions (live loads for decks: 2 kPa for residential, 3 kPa for areas of congregation)
- **AS/NZS 1170.2** — Structural Design Actions Part 2: Wind actions (critical for pergola/verandah/carport design in high wind areas)
- **NCC Volume Two, Part 3.10.6** — Attachment of decks and balconies to external walls

### 9.3 Permit Requirements for Decks and Pergolas

| State | Permit Exemptions (typical) | When Permit IS Required |
|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Decks ≤ 600mm above ground, pergolas meeting exempt development criteria | Decks > 600mm above ground, any structure in heritage areas or bushfire zones |
| **Victoria** | Some minor structures exempt under Building Regulations 2018 | Decks > 800mm above ground, attached structures, roofed carports |
| **Queensland** | Unroofed decks ≤ 1m above ground in some council areas | Roofed structures, decks > 1m above ground, any structure near a boundary |

**Scope impact:** Any outdoor renovation scope that includes a deck or pergola attached to the house should include an engineering line item. This is especially critical for:
- Decks over 1m high
- Structures attached to masonry walls
- Structures attached to fascia
- Areas with high wind classifications (N3+, C1+)

Budget $1,000-$2,500 for structural engineering on deck/pergola connections.

| Freestanding deck < 1m on ground | NO (but must comply with AS 1684) | HIGH |
| Changing roof material (heavy to light or vice versa) | YES (recommended) | MEDIUM |
| Adding solar panels to an older roof | Assessment recommended | MEDIUM |
| Bathroom renovation on a slab (new waste penetrations only) | Assessment recommended if penetrations > 150mm | MEDIUM |
