# Plumbing Scope Research — Section 6: Common Exclusions & Assumptions
## Australian Residential Renovations

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Reference document for AI scope-of-works generator (ScopeAI) — Section 6: Common Exclusions & Assumptions for plumbing trade scopes
**Coverage:** Kitchen, bathroom, laundry, living area, and outdoor plumbing exclusions in residential renovation scopes across all Australian states and territories
**Target Audience:** AI prompt system that generates trade-specific scope-of-works documents for Australian homeowners

**Confidence Notes:**
- **HIGH** — Items marked HIGH are based on established Australian trade practice, statutory requirements, published standards (AS/NZS 3500 series, NCC/PCA), state regulator guidance (NSW Fair Trading, VBA, QBCC), and multiple corroborating industry sources.
- **MEDIUM** — Items marked MEDIUM are based on common industry practice confirmed by trade publications and renovation cost guides, but may vary by region, plumber, or contract type.
- **LOW** — Items marked LOW are based on general industry knowledge where published Australian-specific sources are limited; treated as reasonable estimates pending further verification.

> **Why this section is critical:** The exclusions section of a plumbing scope is the single most important section for preventing disputes. The majority of plumbing-related complaints to NSW Fair Trading, NCAT, VCAT, and QCAT stem from misunderstandings about what was and was not included in a plumbing quote. Homeowners routinely assume that "bathroom plumbing" includes waterproofing, tiling, fixture supply, wall patching, and council fees — none of which are standard plumbing inclusions. A well-drafted exclusions section protects both the homeowner (who can budget accurately) and the plumber (who is not expected to deliver work outside their trade). The AI scope generator must include clear, explicit exclusions in every plumbing scope it produces.

## 6.1 Fixtures and Fittings Supply

### What It Is

Plumbing fixtures and fittings are the visible, functional components that the homeowner interacts with daily: taps (basin mixers, shower mixers, bath fillers, kitchen mixers), sinks (kitchen, laundry, bathroom basins), toilets (toilet suites, cisterns, seats), shower heads, shower arms, bath spouts, floor wastes, pop-up wastes, bottle traps, and related accessories. These items are distinct from the pipework, drainage, and connection infrastructure that the plumber installs behind walls and under floors.

### Why Fixtures Are Typically Excluded from a Plumbing Scope

In Australian residential renovation practice, plumbing fixtures and fittings are overwhelmingly treated as owner-selected, owner-supplied items. This is standard for several important reasons:

1. **Personal design choice:** Tapware, basins, and toilets are among the most personal aesthetic decisions in a renovation. Homeowners want to select products that match their design vision, colour palette, and quality expectations. A plumber cannot anticipate these preferences.

2. **Massive price variance:** The cost difference between budget and premium fixtures is enormous. A toilet suite ranges from $150 (Bunnings budget) to $5,000+ (European designer). A kitchen mixer tap ranges from $80 to $2,000+. A basin ranges from $100 to $3,000+. Including fixture supply in a plumbing quote introduces unacceptable price ambiguity.

3. **WaterMark certification requirement:** Under the Plumbing Code of Australia (NCC Volume Three) and AS/NZS 3718, all plumbing fixtures and fittings installed in Australia must carry WaterMark certification. This is a legal requirement — a licensed plumber cannot install a non-WaterMark-certified product. If the homeowner supplies their own fixtures, the plumber must verify WaterMark certification before installation. If the plumber supplies fixtures, they guarantee compliance.

4. **WELS rating requirement:** Under the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 (Cth), certain plumbing products (taps, showerheads, toilets, urinals, washing machines, dishwashers) must carry a WELS (Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards) star rating. The minimum acceptable rating varies by product type. This is a federal requirement that applies nationwide.

5. **Warranty separation:** Fixture manufacturers provide their own product warranties (typically 5-15 years for quality tapware, 5-10 years for ceramic fixtures). These warranties are separate from the plumber's workmanship warranty. If the plumber supplies the fixture, they may be drawn into warranty disputes that are actually product defects.

### How This Is Handled in Scope Language

| Approach | Scope Language | When Used | Implications |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Install only — owner supplied** | "Install owner-supplied [fixture type]. Plumber to connect to existing/new water supply and drainage points. Owner responsible for ensuring all fixtures are WaterMark certified and WELS rated. Plumber accepts no responsibility for product defects, incorrect sizing, or non-compliant products." | Most common in renovations. Homeowner selects and purchases all fixtures from retail or trade suppliers. | Plumber is responsible for correct installation and connection only. Fixture supply cost is entirely separate from the plumbing quote. |
| **Supply and install** | "Supply and install [specific brand/model] [fixture type] as specified. Supply cost: $X. Installation included." | Used when the plumber offers a package deal, or the homeowner wants the plumber to source fixtures. More common with plumbing firms that have trade accounts. | Plumber carries responsibility for both supply and installation. Product is usually purchased at trade pricing with a margin added. Plumber may warranty the product as well as the installation. |
| **Supply and install with PC sum** | "Supply and install [fixture type]. Provisional allowance of $X for fixture supply. Final cost adjusted based on homeowner's selection." | Used in builder-managed renovations or when the homeowner has not yet finalised selections. | The plumber (or builder) includes an estimated dollar amount. If the homeowner's selection exceeds the allowance, they pay the difference. If it costs less, they receive a credit. |

### Typical Fixture Cost Ranges (2025-2026 AUD)

| Fixture | Budget | Mid-Range | Premium | Luxury |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Toilet suite (back-to-wall or close-coupled) | $150-$400 | $400-$900 | $900-$2,000 | $2,000-$5,000+ |
| Wall-hung toilet suite | $400-$700 | $700-$1,500 | $1,500-$3,000 | $3,000-$6,000+ |
| Basin (above-counter or semi-recessed) | $100-$300 | $300-$700 | $700-$1,500 | $1,500-$3,000+ |
| Basin mixer tap | $80-$200 | $200-$500 | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000+ |
| Shower mixer (concealed) | $100-$250 | $250-$600 | $600-$1,200 | $1,200-$2,500+ |
| Shower head and arm | $50-$150 | $150-$400 | $400-$800 | $800-$1,500+ |
| Kitchen mixer tap | $80-$250 | $250-$600 | $600-$1,200 | $1,200-$2,500+ |
| Kitchen sink (stainless steel, undermount) | $150-$400 | $400-$800 | $800-$1,500 | $1,500-$3,000+ |
| Kitchen sink (granite composite) | $300-$600 | $600-$1,200 | $1,200-$2,000 | $2,000+ |
| Laundry trough (stainless or ceramic) | $100-$300 | $300-$600 | $600-$1,200 | N/A |
| Freestanding bath | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,500 | $2,500-$5,000 | $5,000-$15,000+ |
| Bath filler/spout | $80-$200 | $200-$500 | $500-$1,000 | $1,000+ |
| Floor waste grate | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | $150-$400 | $400+ |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners frequently assume that "bathroom plumbing" or "kitchen plumbing" includes the taps, toilet, and basin. When they receive a plumbing quote of $3,000-$6,000 for a bathroom renovation, they expect fixtures to be included. In reality, the fixture supply cost for a mid-range bathroom can be $2,000-$5,000 on top of the plumbing labour and pipework quote. This must be made explicit in the scope.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always specify "Install only — owner supplied" as the default for all fixtures unless the project context indicates otherwise.
- List every fixture that requires plumbing connection and state whether it is "supply and install" or "install only (owner supplied)."
- Include a note reminding the homeowner that all fixtures must be WaterMark certified and WELS rated.
- Include a note that the homeowner must confirm fixture selections and provide products to site before the plumber's scheduled fit-off date.

## 6.2 Appliance Supply

### What It Is

Plumbing-connected appliances include dishwashers, washing machines, hot water systems (electric, gas, heat pump, solar), water filtration systems, boiling water units, garbage disposal units, and gas cooktops (where the plumber provides the gas connection). These are distinct from fixtures (taps, toilets, basins) in that they are powered appliances with their own mechanical and electrical components.

### Why Appliance Supply Is Excluded from a Standard Plumbing Scope

1. **Owner selection:** Like fixtures, appliances are highly personal choices driven by brand preference, energy efficiency targets, budget, and kitchen/laundry design. The plumber cannot select these on the homeowner's behalf.

2. **Separate warranties:** Appliance manufacturers (e.g., Bosch, Miele, Fisher & Paykel, Rheem, Rinnai) provide their own product warranties that are entirely separate from the plumber's installation warranty. Mixing supply and installation creates warranty confusion.

3. **Price variance:** A dishwasher ranges from $400 (budget Westinghouse) to $3,500+ (Miele integrated). A hot water system ranges from $300 (small electric storage) to $7,000+ (solar or heat pump). These costs belong in the homeowner's appliance budget, not the plumbing quote.

4. **Cross-trade coordination:** Many appliances require both plumbing and electrical connections (e.g., dishwasher needs water supply, drainage, and a dedicated power point). The plumber provides the plumbing connection; the electrician provides the electrical connection. Neither trade supplies the appliance itself.

### Scope Language for Appliances

| Appliance | Scope Language (Install Only) | Scope Language (Supply & Install) |
|---|---|---|
| **Dishwasher** | "Connect owner-supplied dishwasher to hot/cold water supply and drainage. Provide isolation valve. Electrical connection by electrician (excluded)." | "Supply and install [brand/model] dishwasher including water and drainage connection. Electrical connection by electrician (excluded)." |
| **Hot water system** | "Install owner-supplied hot water unit. Connect to cold water supply, hot water outlet, and TPR (temperature/pressure relief) valve drain. Gas connection (if applicable) included/excluded [specify]. Electrical connection by electrician (excluded)." | "Supply and install [brand/model/capacity] hot water system including all plumbing connections, TPR valve, and drain line. [Gas/electrical connection specified separately.]" |
| **Washing machine** | "Provide hot and cold water supply outlets and floor waste/standpipe for owner-supplied washing machine. Machine connection by homeowner or installer." | Not typically supply-and-install by plumber. |
| **Gas cooktop** | "Connect owner-supplied gas cooktop to existing/new gas supply point. Provide isolation valve. Test and certify gas connection per AS/NZS 5601.1." | Usually install-only; plumber provides gas connection, not the cooktop. |
| **Water filter** | "Install owner-supplied under-sink water filtration unit. Connect to cold water supply and provide dedicated filtered water outlet to nominated tap location." | "Supply and install [brand/model] water filtration system including dedicated mixer tap." |

### Hot Water System — Special Considerations

Hot water system replacement is a common component of renovations and deserves specific attention because it often crosses the supply/install boundary:

| Scenario | Typical Approach |
|---|---|
| **Like-for-like replacement** (same type, same location) | Often quoted as supply and install by plumber. Plumber sources at trade pricing. Total cost $1,500-$4,000 depending on type. |
| **System type change** (e.g., electric storage to heat pump or gas continuous) | More complex. May involve new gas line, electrical upgrade, new mounting, condensate drainage (heat pump), or structural support. Often quoted as supply and install with clear specifications. Total cost $3,000-$10,000+. |
| **Owner-supplied unit** | Plumber installs owner-supplied unit. Plumber may decline to warranty the product. Owner responsible for ensuring unit is suitable for the installation location and compliant. |
| **Government rebates** (e.g., Small-scale Technology Certificates for heat pumps) | Plumber may assist with rebate paperwork if they supply the unit. If owner-supplied, rebate processing is the owner's responsibility. |

### Key Dispute Point

The most common appliance-related dispute involves hot water systems. Homeowners underestimate the full cost of changing system type (e.g., switching from electric storage to heat pump requires condensate drainage, electrical upgrade, sometimes a concrete pad, and potentially a new gas line if switching from gas). The plumbing scope should clearly state what type of system is being installed and whether the quote covers the unit supply or installation labour only.

## 6.3 Waterproofing

### What It Is

Waterproofing in a wet area (bathroom, shower, laundry, balcony) involves applying a liquid membrane or sheet membrane to floors and walls to create a water-impervious barrier that prevents moisture penetrating the building structure. In Australian residential renovations, waterproofing is governed by the National Construction Code (NCC Volume Two, Part 10.2) and AS 3740:2021 (Waterproofing of domestic wet areas).

### Why Waterproofing Is a Separate Trade from Plumbing

This is one of the most critical exclusions in a plumbing scope and one of the most misunderstood by homeowners. The plumber and the waterproofer have distinct but coordinated responsibilities:

| Responsibility | Plumber | Waterproofer |
|---|---|---|
| Install floor waste and drainage connections | Yes | No |
| Install shower drain/grate/channel | Yes | No |
| Set floor waste heights and positions | Yes | No |
| Install water supply rough-in (hot/cold pipes) | Yes | No |
| Apply waterproof membrane to floors | No | Yes |
| Apply waterproof membrane to walls | No | Yes |
| Turn membrane up around floor waste/drain and bond to drain flange | No | Yes |
| Bond membrane to pipe penetrations | No | Yes |
| Issue waterproofing compliance certificate | No | Yes |
| Install hob/shower threshold | Varies (sometimes builder/tiler) | Sometimes assists |

### The Sequencing Dependency

The timing relationship between plumbing and waterproofing is critical and is a frequent source of coordination failures:

1. **Plumber performs rough-in** — Installs all pipework, drainage, and floor wastes. Sets floor waste positions. Ensures correct fall to drainage points.
2. **Plumber's rough-in is inspected** — Must pass plumbing inspection before walls are closed.
3. **Screeder applies floor screed** — Establishes correct falls to floor wastes (minimum 1:80, maximum 1:50 as per NCC).
4. **Waterproofer applies membrane** — Applies waterproof membrane to floors and walls in accordance with AS 3740. Membrane must bond correctly to floor waste flanges and pipe penetrations.
5. **Waterproofing is inspected** — In NSW and QLD, a compliance certificate must be issued by the waterproofer. In VIC, the plumber may be required to sign off on waterproofing under certain circumstances.
6. **Tiler installs tiles** — Over the waterproof membrane.
7. **Plumber performs fit-off** — Installs fixtures (taps, toilet, basin, shower mixer) on top of tiled surfaces.

### Where the Boundary Sits

The plumber is responsible for ensuring that:
- Floor waste positions are correctly set to allow the waterproofer to bond the membrane to the drain flange.
- Pipe penetrations through the floor and walls are clean, secure, and suitable for the waterproofer to bond membrane around.
- The drainage system is complete and tested before waterproofing begins.
- The floor waste drain body and flange are compatible with the chosen waterproofing system.

The waterproofer is responsible for ensuring that:
- The membrane is correctly applied and tested per AS 3740.
- The membrane bonds correctly to the plumber's installed drain flanges and pipe penetrations.
- A compliance certificate is issued (mandatory in NSW and QLD; required for insurance in all states).

### Licensing Requirements by State

| State/Territory | Waterproofing Licensing | Plumber's Role in Waterproofing |
|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Licensed waterproofing contractor required for work over $5,000 (Home Building Act 1989). All waterproofing requires compliance certificate. | Plumber does NOT waterproof. Separate trade. |
| **QLD** | Licensed waterproofing contractor required. Compliance certificate mandatory. | Plumber does NOT waterproof. Separate trade. |
| **VIC** | No mandatory waterproofer licence, but compliance certificate must be lodged with VBA by a licensed plumber within 5 business days. Some plumbers hold waterproofing endorsements. | Some plumbers in VIC perform waterproofing if endorsed. Still best practice to use specialist waterproofer. |
| **SA** | No separate waterproofing licence. Work may be performed by a builder or licensed tradesperson. | Plumber may do waterproofing if competent, but not standard practice. |
| **WA** | No mandatory waterproofer licence. | Similar to SA. |
| **TAS, ACT, NT** | No separate waterproofing licence. | Similar to SA/WA. |

### Approximate Waterproofing Costs (Separate from Plumbing)

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Standard bathroom waterproofing (floor + wet walls to 1800mm) | $1,500-$3,500 |
| Large bathroom or wet room (full floor + all walls) | $3,000-$6,000 |
| Shower only (floor + walls) | $800-$2,000 |
| Laundry (floor only) | $600-$1,500 |
| Balcony waterproofing | $2,000-$5,000+ |
| Waterproofing compliance certificate | Included in waterproofer's quote (mandatory in NSW/QLD) |

### Key Dispute Point

This is arguably the number one source of plumbing scope disputes in bathroom renovations. Homeowners routinely assume that "bathroom plumbing" includes waterproofing. It does not. Waterproofing is a separate trade, a separate cost ($1,500-$3,500 for a standard bathroom), and requires a separate compliance certificate. Failure to waterproof, or failure to waterproof correctly, can result in catastrophic moisture damage to the building structure, with repair costs of $20,000-$50,000+. Non-compliance also voids building insurance in most cases.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always list waterproofing as an exclusion in the plumbing scope.
- Add a note: "Waterproofing of wet areas is a separate trade and is NOT included in this plumbing scope. A licensed waterproofer must waterproof all wet areas in accordance with AS 3740:2021 and NCC Part 10.2 before tiling commences. A waterproofing compliance certificate is mandatory in NSW and QLD."
- In the sequencing plan, ensure waterproofing is sequenced between plumbing rough-in and tiling.

## 6.4 Tiling and Tile Repair

### What It Is

Tiling includes the supply and installation of wall tiles, floor tiles, mosaic tiles, and associated materials (adhesive, grout, waterproofing primer, tile trim, movement joints) in bathrooms, kitchens, laundries, and outdoor areas. Tile repair refers to the replacement or re-grouting of tiles that are damaged, removed, or disturbed during plumbing work.

### Why Tiling Is Excluded from a Plumbing Scope

Tiling is a completely separate trade from plumbing. A licensed plumber is not a tiler, does not carry tiling tools or materials, and is not insured or qualified to perform tiling work. However, homeowners frequently assume that "bathroom plumbing" includes tile repair — particularly when tiles must be removed to access pipework behind walls or in floors.

### The Boundary Between Plumbing and Tiling

| Situation | Plumber's Responsibility | Tiler's Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Full renovation (strip and re-tile)** | Install pipework behind walls and in floors before tiling. Set mixer valve positions, shower outlet positions, and basin tap positions at correct heights. | Install tiles over waterproof membrane. Cut tile openings for pipe penetrations, mixers, shower outlets. |
| **Plumbing repair requiring tile removal** | Remove tiles as necessary to access pipework (or arrange demolition contractor). Repair pipework. | Replace removed tiles. Match existing tiles if possible (homeowner to supply replacement tiles). |
| **Mixer valve replacement** | Remove existing mixer, install new mixer. May need to remove surrounding tiles for access. | Repair/replace tiles around mixer valve area after plumber completes work. |
| **Leaking shower repair** | Identify and repair leak source (e.g., failed pipe joint, cracked fitting). | Re-tile affected area if tiles were removed for access. May require full re-waterproofing and re-tiling if the leak was behind the membrane. |

### The "Who Pays for Tile Repair?" Question

This is a frequent source of disputes, particularly in maintenance and repair scenarios (as opposed to full renovations where tiles are being replaced anyway):

- **If tiles are removed as part of a planned renovation:** The cost of re-tiling is part of the tiling scope, not the plumbing scope. The plumber's rough-in is done before tiling begins.
- **If tiles must be removed to access a leak or repair pipework in an existing bathroom:** The plumber is responsible for providing access to the pipes. This may involve tile removal. However, the plumber is NOT responsible for replacing the tiles. Tile replacement is the tiler's scope. The homeowner bears the cost of tile replacement unless the leak was caused by defective plumbing workmanship within the warranty period.
- **If the plumber negligently damages tiles during their work:** The plumber may be liable for the cost of tile repair/replacement. However, normal tile removal required for access is not considered negligence.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always list tiling as an exclusion in the plumbing scope.
- For renovation scopes: Add a note that tiling is a separate trade and is not included.
- For repair scopes: Add a note that tile removal for access is included, but tile replacement/repair after plumbing work is complete is excluded and is the homeowner's responsibility.
- Include wording such as: "Tiling, tile repair, tile replacement, and grouting are excluded from this scope. Any tiles removed for plumbing access will not be replaced by the plumber. Tile repair is the responsibility of a qualified tiler, to be engaged separately by the homeowner."

## 6.5 Core Drilling Through Concrete Slab

### What It Is

Core drilling is the process of cutting cylindrical holes through concrete slabs, foundations, or structural elements using a diamond-tipped core drill. In plumbing, core drilling is required when new drainage lines or water supply lines need to pass through a concrete slab — for example, when relocating a toilet, adding a new floor waste, or running new drainage through a ground-floor slab-on-ground construction.

### When Core Drilling Is In-Scope vs Excluded

| Scenario | Typically In-Scope (Plumber) | Typically Excluded (Specialist) |
|---|---|---|
| **Small penetrations through brick/timber walls** for pipe runs | Yes — plumber drills these as part of standard work | N/A |
| **Core drilling through concrete slab** for new drainage or water supply | Sometimes — if plumber has the equipment and the slab is standard thickness (<200mm) with known reinforcement | Often — if slab is thick, heavily reinforced, post-tensioned, or the plumber does not have core drilling equipment |
| **Core drilling through structural elements** (beams, columns, load-bearing walls) | No — requires engineer approval and specialist core driller | Yes — specialist concrete cutter with engineer's markings |
| **Saw-cutting concrete slab** to expose/modify drainage trenches | Sometimes included by plumber; sometimes requires specialist concrete cutter | If extensive cutting is needed, or if the slab is post-tensioned |

### Why Core Drilling May Be Excluded

1. **Specialist equipment:** Diamond core drilling rigs are expensive and not all plumbers carry them. Many plumbers subcontract core drilling to specialist concrete cutting firms.

2. **Structural risk:** Drilling through a slab without knowing the reinforcement layout can sever rebar or post-tensioning cables, causing catastrophic structural failure. A GPR (ground-penetrating radar) scan may be required before drilling, which is a separate service.

3. **Variable pricing:** Core drilling costs depend on hole diameter, slab thickness, reinforcement density, access, and the number of holes. A single core hole through a 100mm slab might cost $80-$150, while multiple holes through a 200mm+ reinforced slab can cost $500-$2,000+.

4. **Dust and slurry management:** Core drilling produces significant concrete slurry that must be contained and disposed of. Water supply for wet drilling must be arranged.

### Approximate Core Drilling Costs (2025-2026 AUD)

| Hole Diameter | Cost per Hole (100mm slab) | Cost per Hole (200mm+ slab) |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 50mm (water supply pipes) | $50-$150 | $100-$250 |
| 50mm-100mm (small drainage) | $80-$200 | $150-$350 |
| 100mm-150mm (standard drainage) | $150-$350 | $250-$500 |
| 150mm-225mm (large drainage, toilet) | $250-$500 | $400-$800+ |

Additional costs:
- **Minimum call-out / service fee:** $100-$200
- **GPR scanning (if required):** $300-$600 per scan area
- **After-hours surcharge:** $40-$80/hour additional
- **Inverted (overhead) drilling surcharge:** 50-100% premium
- **Excessive reinforcement surcharge:** $50-$150 per hole additional
- **Disposal of concrete cores:** Usually client responsibility or $50-$100 additional

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- If the project involves a concrete slab and requires relocating drainage or adding new penetrations, include core drilling as either:
  - An explicit line item in the plumbing scope (if the plumber is expected to arrange it), or
  - An explicit exclusion with a note that a specialist concrete cutter may be required.
- For apartments and multi-storey buildings, always exclude core drilling and note that body corporate approval may be required for slab penetrations.
- Include wording such as: "Core drilling through concrete slab for new drainage penetrations is [included/excluded]. If excluded, a specialist concrete cutter will be required and is to be arranged separately. GPR scanning of the slab to locate reinforcement may be required before any concrete penetrations — this is excluded."

## 6.6 Council, Water Authority, and Regulatory Fees

### What It Is

Plumbing work in Australian residential renovations triggers a range of regulatory fees that are payable to government authorities, water utilities, and certifiers — not to the plumber. These fees are almost always excluded from a plumbing quote because they are variable, set by third parties, and payable directly by the homeowner or builder.

### Categories of Regulatory Fees

#### 6.6.1 Plumbing Inspection Fees (NSW — Building Commission NSW)

In NSW, plumbing and drainage work in the Sydney, Illawarra, Blue Mountains, Newcastle, and Hunter regions requires inspection by Building Commission NSW (formerly Fair Trading). The plumber lodges a Notice of Work (NoW) via the MyInspections gateway, and an inspector attends site to verify compliance.

**NSW Inspection Fees (FY 2025-2026, Schedule 1 Clause 13 of the Plumbing and Drainage Regulation 2017):**

| Inspection Type | Fee (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Standard inspection (weekday, business hours) | $130 |
| Initial performance solution inspection | $322 |
| Additional performance solution inspection | $191 |
| Weekend inspection | $1,081 |
| Public holiday inspection | $1,081 |
| Before 8am or after 4pm weekday | $1,081 |

**Important:** Inspection fees are per inspection type, not per visit. If both internal and external drainage work are inspected, this counts as two inspections ($260 total), even if done in one visit. The only exception is when external drainage does not exceed 3 metres and does not involve additional structures.

In regional NSW, councils handle their own plumbing inspections at locally set fee schedules.

#### 6.6.2 Plumbing Compliance Certificate Fees (VIC — VBA)

In Victoria, the licensed plumber must lodge a compliance certificate with the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) for all regulated plumbing work. The plumber purchases compliance certificates from the VBA and includes the cost in their quote or passes it on to the homeowner.

**VIC Compliance Certificate Fee:** Approximately $37-$45 per certificate (exact current fee available from VBA fee schedule; indexed annually).

**Note:** From 13 August 2025, compliance certificates purchased from VBA have a 12-month expiry date under section 221ZN(1A) of the Building Act 1993.

#### 6.6.3 Water Authority Connection and Disconnection Fees

If the renovation requires a new water connection, upgraded water meter, or sewer connection, the local water authority charges fees:

| Authority | Service | Approximate Fee (AUD) |
|---|---|---|
| **Sydney Water** | New 20mm water service connection | Varies — contact Sydney Water for current pricing |
| **Sydney Water** | Smart meter fee (new connections from 1 Oct 2025) | Applicable to new 20mm services; amount set by Sydney Water |
| **Sydney Water** | Sewer connection | $500-$2,000+ (varies by location and complexity) |
| **Melbourne Water / Yarra Valley / South East Water / Greater Western** | Water connection | $500-$3,000+ depending on service type |
| **SA Water** | Water connection fee (standard residential) | $1,000-$5,000+ (varies by connection type) |
| **Queensland Urban Utilities / Unity Water** | Water meter connection | $500-$2,000+ |

These fees are highly variable by authority, location, and service type. They are always excluded from a plumbing quote.

#### 6.6.4 Council/Certifier Approval Fees

If the plumbing work is part of a broader renovation that requires development approval (DA or CDC) or a construction certificate, these fees are payable to council or a private certifier. They are not plumbing-specific fees but are triggered by the overall renovation.

#### 6.6.5 Sewer Service Diagram

In NSW, the plumber must submit a sewer service diagram to Building Commission NSW as part of the Notice of Work process. Some plumbers include the preparation cost in their quote; others charge it as a separate item or the fee is absorbed into their labour rate.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always exclude council/authority fees from the plumbing scope.
- Add a standard exclusion line: "All council inspection fees, water authority connection fees, compliance certificate fees, and regulatory charges are excluded from this scope and are payable separately by the homeowner."
- If the project is in NSW: Note that plumbing inspection fees apply (from $130 per inspection for standard weekday inspections).
- If the project is in VIC: Note that a plumbing compliance certificate must be lodged with the VBA.

## 6.7 Asbestos-Related Costs

### What It Is

Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) are prevalent in Australian homes built before 1990 and remain common in homes built before the full asbestos ban in 2003. In the plumbing context, asbestos can be encountered in:

- **Pipe lagging** — Asbestos insulation wrapped around hot water pipes, heating pipes, and steam pipes. This is typically friable (crumbly) asbestos, which is the most dangerous form.
- **Asbestos-cement (AC) drainage pipes** — More than 40,000 km of AC water and sewer pipes remain in Australian infrastructure, primarily installed between the 1920s and 1980s. These are non-friable when intact but become hazardous when cut, drilled, or broken.
- **Fibro wall and ceiling linings** — Asbestos-cement (fibro) sheeting used as wall and ceiling lining in bathrooms, laundries, and kitchens. Plumbers may need to cut through these to access pipework.
- **Vinyl floor tiles and adhesive** — Some pre-1990 vinyl floor tiles and their black bituminous adhesive contain asbestos. These may be disturbed when modifying floor-level drainage.
- **Eaves, fascia, and exterior cladding** — May contain asbestos and may need to be penetrated for external pipe runs.

### Why Asbestos Is Excluded from a Standard Plumbing Scope

1. **Separate licensing requirement:** Asbestos removal in Australia requires a Class A licence (friable asbestos) or Class B licence (non-friable/bonded asbestos) under state and territory WHS Regulations. Most plumbers do not hold an asbestos removal licence.

2. **Legal obligation to stop work:** If a plumber discovers suspected asbestos during work, they are legally required to stop work immediately, isolate the area, and arrange testing and licensed removal. This is not optional — continuing work in the presence of suspected ACMs is a criminal offence under WHS legislation, with fines exceeding $50,000 for individuals.

3. **Unknown quantity:** The presence and extent of asbestos cannot always be determined before work begins. Asbestos may be hidden behind wall linings, under floor coverings, or inside pipe cavities. A plumber cannot price what they cannot see.

4. **Specialist disposal:** ACMs must be disposed of at an EPA-licensed facility. Standard construction waste disposal facilities do not accept asbestos.

### How the Plumbing Scope Should Handle Asbestos

| Approach | When Used | Scope Language |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-work asbestos testing** | Best practice for all pre-1990 homes. Test before quoting. | "An asbestos inspection and testing has been conducted prior to quoting. [Results noted.] Scope assumes no additional asbestos will be encountered." |
| **Exclusion with provisional sum** | When testing has not been done and asbestos is possible. | "Asbestos testing, removal, and disposal are excluded. If asbestos-containing materials are discovered during work, all work will stop and a licensed asbestos removalist will be required before work can resume. A provisional sum of $[X] may be allowed for potential asbestos remediation." |
| **Blanket exclusion** | Standard. | "All costs associated with asbestos testing, removal, disposal, and air monitoring are excluded from this scope. These costs are the homeowner's responsibility." |

### Approximate Asbestos-Related Costs (2025-2026 AUD)

| Item | Cost Range |
|---|---|
| Laboratory testing per sample (NATA-accredited) | $40-$140 per sample |
| Professional asbestos inspection (residential property) | $300-$800 |
| Pipe lagging removal (small area, <10m of pipe) | $500-$2,000 |
| Pipe lagging removal (extensive, multiple rooms) | $2,000-$8,000+ |
| Fibro wall lining removal (single room, e.g., bathroom) | $1,000-$4,000 |
| AC drainage pipe removal and replacement (per metre) | $300-$800+ per metre |
| Asbestos disposal fees at licensed facility | $300-$500+ |
| Air monitoring (independent licensed assessor) | $300-$1,500 |

### Key Dispute Point

The most common asbestos-related dispute occurs when a plumber begins work on a pre-1990 home, discovers suspected asbestos pipe lagging or fibro wall lining, stops work (as legally required), and the homeowner is faced with an unexpected cost of $1,000-$8,000+ for asbestos removal before plumbing work can resume. The homeowner often blames the plumber for not "including" this in the quote. A clear exclusion clause prevents this dispute.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- For properties built before 1990 (or "unknown" age): Always include an asbestos exclusion clause and a warning note.
- For properties built after 2003: Asbestos is unlikely but cannot be completely ruled out (renovated properties may have asbestos from previous works).
- Add a condition flag note: "Property age suggests potential for asbestos-containing materials. An asbestos inspection is recommended before plumbing work commences."
- Always include: "If asbestos-containing materials are discovered during plumbing work, all work will be paused until a licensed asbestos removalist has tested and removed the material. This cost is excluded from the plumbing scope."

## 6.8 Structural Modifications

### What It Is

Structural modifications in the plumbing context refer to any work that involves cutting, removing, or modifying structural elements of the building to accommodate pipe runs, drainage lines, or plumbing fixtures. Common examples include:

- **Cutting trenches through a concrete slab** to modify or install new drainage lines
- **Removing or modifying concrete to access drains** embedded in or beneath the slab
- **Cutting through load-bearing walls** to run pipe chases
- **Cutting structural floor joists or bearers** to accommodate drainage falls
- **Modifying or relocating structural steel** to accommodate new pipe routes
- **Breaking out concrete hobs, plinths, or steps** to access or modify drainage

### Why Structural Modifications Are Excluded from a Standard Plumbing Scope

1. **Engineering requirement:** Any modification to a structural element requires a structural engineer's assessment and approval. The plumber is not qualified to determine whether a wall is load-bearing or whether cutting a joist will compromise structural integrity.

2. **Separate trade:** Concrete cutting, excavation, and structural modification are typically performed by a demolition contractor, builder, or specialist concrete cutter — not by the plumber.

3. **Variable scope:** The extent of structural work required is often unknown until demolition reveals the existing construction. A plumber cannot price structural modifications without knowing exactly what is behind the walls or under the floor.

4. **Insurance and liability:** Damage to structural elements during plumbing work can create significant liability. Plumbers' professional indemnity and public liability insurance may not cover structural damage caused by unauthorised modifications.

### Common Structural Modification Scenarios in Plumbing

| Scenario | Who Is Responsible | Approximate Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Relocating toilet (slab-on-ground)** — requires cutting concrete slab to modify drainage fall | Builder/concrete cutter performs slab cutting; plumber installs new drainage | Slab cutting: $500-$3,000. Plumbing: separate. |
| **Adding new floor waste in concrete slab** — requires core drilling or slab cutting | Plumber or concrete cutter, depending on complexity | Core hole: $150-$500. Trenching: $500-$2,000. |
| **Relocating kitchen sink (slab-on-ground)** — may require new drainage route through slab | Builder/concrete cutter; plumber installs pipework | $1,000-$5,000+ depending on distance and slab condition |
| **Running new pipe chase through brick/masonry wall** | Plumber may chase into non-structural walls; structural walls require engineer approval and builder/demolisher | Non-structural: often included. Structural: $500-$2,000+ |
| **Modifying floor joists (timber floor)** for drainage fall | Builder/carpenter with engineer approval | $500-$2,000+ |

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always exclude structural modifications from the plumbing scope.
- If the project involves relocating drainage on a slab-on-ground property, flag that concrete cutting/trenching may be required and is excluded.
- If the project involves significant pipe rerouting, add a note: "Structural modifications including concrete cutting, slab trenching, modification to load-bearing elements, and cutting or notching of structural framing are excluded. These works require structural engineer approval and are to be carried out by an appropriately qualified builder or specialist contractor."
- For apartments: Note that modifications to the slab may affect other units and require body corporate consent.

## 6.9 Sewer Line Repair and Replacement

### What It Is

Sewer line repair or replacement refers to work on the underground drainage system that connects the house to the main sewer line (typically owned by the local water authority — e.g., Sydney Water, Melbourne Water, SA Water). This includes the private sewer line that runs from the house to the property boundary or sewer junction.

### Why Sewer Line Repair Is Excluded (Unless Specifically Scoped)

Sewer line repair is one of the most common "surprise" costs in renovations. During plumbing rough-in or drainage connection work, the plumber may discover that the existing sewer line is:

- **Cracked, collapsed, or broken** (common in earthenware or AC pipes from the 1960s-1980s)
- **Root-affected** (tree roots penetrating pipe joints)
- **Incorrectly graded** (insufficient fall, causing pooling and blockages)
- **Made of asbestos-cement** (requiring licensed removal — see Section 6.7)
- **Bellied or sagging** (sections have sunk due to ground movement)

The plumber cannot predict the condition of buried sewer lines before excavation or CCTV inspection. Including sewer repair in a plumbing quote would introduce massive cost uncertainty.

### How Sewer Line Issues Are Typically Handled

| Approach | Description | Scope Language |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-work CCTV inspection** | Before quoting, the plumber runs a CCTV camera through the sewer line to assess condition. Findings inform the quote. | "A CCTV sewer inspection has been conducted. [Results: satisfactory / requires repair.] Scope includes/excludes sewer repair based on findings." |
| **Exclusion with provisional sum** | Sewer repair is excluded but a contingency allowance is noted for budgeting. | "Sewer line repair/replacement is excluded. A provisional sum of $[X] is recommended for potential sewer repairs if required. Actual cost will be quoted if issues are discovered during work." |
| **Blanket exclusion** | Standard approach when condition is unknown. | "Repair, relining, or replacement of existing sewer lines is excluded from this scope. If the existing sewer is found to be damaged, collapsed, root-affected, or non-compliant during work, repairs will be quoted separately." |
| **Scope as a separate line item** | When CCTV has confirmed sewer damage and repair is part of the planned work. | "Replace approximately [X] metres of existing [material] sewer line with new [PVC/other] pipe. Excavate, lay, backfill, and compact. Connect to existing junction/boundary trap." |

### Sewer Repair Methods and Costs (2025-2026 AUD)

| Method | Description | Cost Range |
|---|---|---|
| **CCTV sewer inspection** (diagnostic) | Camera inspection to assess sewer condition | $200-$600 |
| **High-pressure water jetting** (root clearance) | Clearing root intrusion and blockages | $300-$800 |
| **Pipe relining (trenchless)** | Inserting a resin-coated liner to create a new pipe within the old one | $400-$700 per linear metre; $2,000-$8,000+ total |
| **Pipe patching (trenchless)** | Localised liner repair for a single damaged section | $500-$1,500 per patch |
| **Traditional excavation and replacement** | Dig up old pipe, replace with new PVC | $180-$500+ per linear metre; $5,000-$20,000+ total |
| **Partial replacement** | Replace only the damaged section | $1,500-$5,000+ |
| **Full replacement** (boundary to house) | Replace entire private sewer line | $6,000-$25,000+ |

### Responsibility Boundaries — Homeowner vs Water Authority

| Element | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Private sewer line** (from house to boundary/junction) | Homeowner |
| **Shared sewer line** (serving multiple properties) | Typically the water authority, but disputes are common |
| **Main sewer** (in the street) | Water authority (e.g., Sydney Water, Melbourne Water) |
| **Boundary trap / junction** | Varies by authority — check local rules |
| **Overflow relief gully (ORG)** | Homeowner (must be maintained) |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners are frequently shocked when a renovation uncovers a damaged sewer line, adding $5,000-$25,000 to the project cost. This is especially common in older homes with earthenware or AC pipes. A pre-work CCTV inspection ($200-$600) is a wise investment that the AI scope generator should recommend for properties over 30 years old.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always exclude sewer repair from the plumbing scope unless specifically identified through a CCTV inspection.
- For properties over 30 years old: Add a recommendation for a CCTV sewer inspection before work commences.
- Include wording: "Repair, relining, or replacement of existing sewer lines is excluded. The condition of the existing sewer has not been assessed. If damaged or non-compliant drainage is discovered during work, repairs will be quoted as a variation. A CCTV sewer inspection is recommended for properties over 30 years old."
- Include a suggested provisional sum range: "$2,000-$8,000 for potential sewer repairs."

## 6.10 Making Good (Patching Walls, Floors, and Ceilings)

### What It Is

"Making good" refers to the repair and restoration of walls, floors, ceilings, and other building surfaces after plumbing work has been completed. Plumbing installation often requires cutting chases (channels) in walls for pipe runs, drilling holes through walls, floors, and ceilings for pipe penetrations, and sometimes opening up wall or floor cavities to access existing pipework. After the plumbing is installed and inspected, these surfaces need to be restored.

### Who Is Responsible for Making Good?

This is one of the most frequently disputed items in Australian residential plumbing scopes. The general industry convention is:

| Work Type | Who Makes Good | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **New construction / full renovation** (walls being re-lined anyway) | Builder/plasterer — as part of the renovation scope | Walls are being replaced regardless; plumber's rough-in happens before new lining goes up. No making good required from plumber. |
| **Pipe chase in existing wall** (plumber cuts a channel for new pipes) | Plumber makes the chase; **plasterer** patches and finishes it | The plumber is not a plasterer. Patching a pipe chase to a paintable standard requires plastering skill, tools, and materials that are outside the plumber's trade. |
| **Small penetrations** (e.g., drilling a 25mm hole through a wall for a pipe) | Often the plumber fills/patches around the pipe with appropriate sealant or fire collar | Small penetrations are considered part of the plumber's normal work. Cosmetic finishing (painting) is not included. |
| **Floor penetrations in concrete slab** | Builder/concreter reinstates the slab; plumber does not do concrete work | Concrete reinstatement is a separate trade. |
| **Ceiling access** (cut-outs in plasterboard ceiling for pipe access) | Plasterer repairs the ceiling | Plumber may cut access holes; plasterer patches and finishes. |
| **Tile removal for plumbing access** | See Section 6.4 — tiler replaces tiles | Plumber is not a tiler. |

### The Standard Position in Australian Plumbing Scopes

The overwhelming standard practice is:

> **The plumber is responsible for the plumbing installation. Making good of walls, floors, and ceilings after plumbing work is NOT included in the plumbing scope and is the responsibility of the builder, plasterer, tiler, or other finishing trades.**

This applies to both new work and repair/maintenance work. Even when a plumber cuts a chase in an existing wall for an urgent repair, the plumber is not expected to plaster, paint, or tile over the repair. The homeowner arranges a plasterer and painter to finish the surface.

### The Exception: Emergency Repairs

In emergency plumbing repairs (e.g., burst pipe), some plumbers will offer "basic making good" as a courtesy or additional charged service — for example, roughly patching a wall with plaster filler. This is a basic, non-cosmetic repair that still requires a plasterer and painter for a proper finish. Some home insurance policies cover the making-good cost for emergency repairs separately.

### Approximate Making Good Costs (Separate from Plumbing)

| Item | Trade Required | Approximate Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Patch and finish a single pipe chase in plasterboard wall (up to 2m long) | Plasterer | $150-$400 |
| Patch and finish multiple pipe chases (e.g., bathroom rough-in, 3-5 chases) | Plasterer | $400-$1,200 |
| Replace a section of plasterboard ceiling (access hole, up to 600mm x 600mm) | Plasterer | $150-$350 |
| Reinstate concrete floor after slab cutting (per square metre) | Concreter | $200-$500 per m2 |
| Re-render a section of brick wall after chasing | Renderer | $200-$600 |
| Paint patched areas to match existing (per room) | Painter | $200-$600 |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners regularly assume that the plumber will leave the bathroom or kitchen looking "finished" after plumbing work. In reality, the plumber leaves the room with functional plumbing — but with raw pipe chases, unsealed penetrations, and exposed pipework that requires other trades (plasterer, tiler, painter) to finish. In a full renovation, this is coordinated by the builder and is not an issue. In smaller plumbing jobs or repair work, homeowners are often surprised by the additional cost and coordination required for making good.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always include making good as an explicit exclusion.
- Wording: "Making good of walls, floors, and ceilings after plumbing work (including plastering, rendering, tiling, painting, and concrete reinstatement) is excluded from this scope. These works are to be arranged separately by the homeowner with the appropriate finishing trades."
- In renovation contexts where a builder is coordinating: Note that making good is typically part of the builder's scope, not the plumber's.
- For repair/maintenance contexts: Emphasise that making good is excluded and the homeowner should budget separately.

## 6.11 Supply and Install vs Install Only vs Rough-In Only — Definitions

### Why Clear Definitions Matter

These three terms describe fundamentally different scopes of work, but homeowners routinely confuse them. A plumbing quote that says "bathroom plumbing" without specifying which of these three scopes is being provided is a recipe for disputes. The AI scope generator must always be explicit about which scope applies.

### Definitions with Examples

#### "Supply and Install" (S&I)

**Definition:** The plumber provides both the product/material AND the labour to install it. The plumber sources, purchases, delivers, and installs the item.

**What is included:**
- The product itself (e.g., a Rheem 250L electric hot water system, a Caroma Liano II toilet suite)
- Delivery to site
- All labour to install, connect, test, and commission
- Any ancillary fittings required for installation (connectors, valves, brackets)
- Compliance testing and certification

**What is NOT included:**
- Other trade work required for the installation (electrical connection, structural support, etc.) unless explicitly stated
- Council/authority fees
- Making good of surfaces

**Example scope line:** "Supply and install Rheem 315L Stellar 850 Series gas storage hot water system. Includes unit supply, removal and disposal of existing unit, all plumbing connections, temperature/pressure relief valve and drain, gas connection, and commissioning. Electrical connection by electrician (excluded). Council inspection fees excluded."

**Pricing context:** When a plumber supplies and installs, they typically purchase at trade pricing (15-40% below retail) and add a margin. The homeowner pays one price for the whole package. Warranty may cover both product and installation.

#### "Install Only" (Owner Supplied / IO)

**Definition:** The homeowner (or builder) purchases and supplies the product. The plumber provides labour only to install, connect, test, and commission the product.

**What is included:**
- All labour to install, connect, test, and commission the owner-supplied product
- Ancillary fittings required for installation (connectors, valves, brackets — sometimes included, sometimes charged extra)
- Compliance testing and certification of the installation
- Verification that the product is WaterMark certified (for fixtures/fittings)

**What is NOT included:**
- The product itself
- Delivery of the product to site (homeowner's responsibility)
- Product warranty (remains with the manufacturer; the plumber warranties their installation only)
- Replacement of the product if it is defective, incorrect, or non-compliant

**Example scope line:** "Install owner-supplied Caroma Luna wall-hung toilet suite. Includes installation of concealed cistern in stud wall, pan mounting, connection to water supply and drainage, and commissioning. Owner to supply toilet suite on site before scheduled installation date. Plumber to verify WaterMark certification. Plumber does not warranty the product."

**Important note:** If the homeowner supplies a non-WaterMark-certified product, the plumber must refuse to install it. This should be stated in the scope.

#### "Rough-In Only" (RIO)

**Definition:** The plumber installs all pipework, drainage, and connection points within the wall cavity, floor, and ceiling — but does NOT install any visible fixtures or fittings. The rough-in is the "behind the wall" plumbing infrastructure. Fixtures are installed later in a separate "fit-off" or "trim-out" stage.

**What is included:**
- Hot and cold water supply pipes run to nominated fixture locations
- Drainage pipes run to nominated fixture locations with correct falls
- Sewer vent pipes installed to code
- Floor waste drains installed and set to correct heights
- Isolation valves installed at each fixture point
- Shower mixer rough-in valve body installed in wall cavity
- Pipe testing (pressure testing of water supply lines)
- Drainage testing (water test of drainage)
- Ready for plumbing inspection

**What is NOT included:**
- Any visible fixtures (taps, mixers, shower heads, basins, toilets, sinks)
- Any visible fittings (tap handles, cover plates, shower arms)
- Connection of fixtures to rough-in points (this is the "fit-off" stage)
- Waterproofing (separate trade — must occur after rough-in and before tiling)
- Tiling
- Making good of walls/floors

**Example scope line:** "Plumbing rough-in for bathroom renovation. Includes: hot and cold water supply to basin, shower, and toilet locations; drainage connections for basin, shower floor waste, and toilet; sewer vent pipe; all isolation valves; pressure testing of water supply lines; drainage testing. Ready for plumbing inspection. Fit-off of fixtures to be quoted and scheduled separately after tiling is complete."

### The Two-Stage Plumbing Process

In a renovation, plumbing typically happens in two distinct stages:

| Stage | Timing | Scope | Typical Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1: Rough-in** | After demolition, before wall lining and waterproofing | All pipework behind walls and under floors. Set heights, positions, and drainage falls. | 1-3 days (bathroom); 0.5-1 day (kitchen) |
| **Stage 2: Fit-off (Trim-out)** | After waterproofing, tiling, and painting are complete | Install all visible fixtures — toilets, basins, taps, mixers, shower heads, accessories. Connect to rough-in points. Final testing. | 0.5-2 days (bathroom); 0.5-1 day (kitchen) |

There may be weeks or months between rough-in and fit-off. The plumber returns to site for fit-off only when all other trades (waterproofer, tiler, plasterer, painter) have finished their work.

### Typical Cost Breakdown — Bathroom Example

| Component | Approximate Cost (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Rough-in (pipework, drainage, testing) | $2,000-$5,000 |
| Fit-off (fixture installation, commissioning) | $1,000-$3,000 |
| **Total plumbing labour** (rough-in + fit-off) | **$3,000-$8,000** |
| Fixtures and fittings (if owner-supplied) | $2,000-$10,000+ (separate) |

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always specify whether the plumbing scope is "rough-in only," "fit-off only," "rough-in and fit-off," "supply and install," or "install only."
- For full renovations: Scope should cover both rough-in and fit-off as separate line items/phases.
- For each fixture: Specify whether it is "supply and install" or "install only (owner supplied)."
- Include a clear note explaining the two-stage process and the gap between rough-in and fit-off.

## 6.12 Gas Fitting

### What It Is

Gas fitting is the installation, alteration, repair, and maintenance of gas piping, gas appliance connections, and gas-related components. In a residential renovation, gas fitting may be required for gas cooktops, gas ovens, gas hot water systems, gas bayonet points (for portable heaters), and gas barbecue connections.

### Why Gas Fitting May Be Excluded or Separately Listed

1. **Separate licensing:** In most Australian states and territories, gas fitting requires a specific licence or endorsement beyond a standard plumbing licence. Not all plumbers are licensed gas fitters. In NSW, a plumber must hold a separate gasfitting endorsement under the Gas & Electricity (Consumer Safety) Act 2017. In Victoria, gasfitting classes are defined in the Plumbing Regulations 2018 and administered by the VBA.

2. **Separate compliance certificate:** Gas fitting work requires its own compliance certificate (Certificate of Compliance for gasfitting), separate from the plumbing compliance certificate. In NSW, the gasfitter must provide a completed Certificate of Compliance or Certificate of Inspection within 5 business days of completing work.

3. **Separate standards:** Gas fitting is governed by AS/NZS 5601.1 (Gas installations — General installations) and AS/NZS 5601.2 (Gas installations — LP gas installations in caravans and boats), which are separate from the plumbing standards (AS/NZS 3500 series).

4. **Separate insurance:** Some plumbers' insurance policies have specific exclusions for gas fitting work, or require a separate gas fitting endorsement on their policy.

### How This Affects the Plumbing Scope

| Scenario | Scope Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Plumber holds gas fitting licence** | Gas work can be included in the same quote. Should be listed as a separate line item or section within the plumbing scope. |
| **Plumber does NOT hold gas fitting licence** | Gas work is excluded from the plumbing scope entirely. A separate licensed gas fitter must be engaged. |
| **New gas connection required** (e.g., no existing gas to the property) | Gas supply connection from the network is arranged through the gas retailer/distributor (e.g., Jemena, AGN). Connection fees are excluded. |
| **Gas appliance changeover** (e.g., electric cooktop to gas) | Requires new gas line, isolation valve, and gas fitting compliance certificate. May also require electrical disconnection (electrician). |

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- If the project involves gas (gas cooktop, gas hot water, gas bayonet), either:
  - Include gas fitting as a separate section within the plumbing scope (assuming the plumber is licensed for gas), OR
  - Exclude gas fitting explicitly and note that a licensed gas fitter is required.
- Always include a separate compliance certificate note for gas work.
- Wording: "Gas fitting work (including gas line installation/modification, appliance connection, testing, and gas compliance certification) is [included as a separate section / excluded — a licensed gas fitter is required]."

## 6.13 Standard Exclusion Clauses — Template Wording

### Purpose

The following exclusion clauses are template wording that the AI scope generator should adapt and include in every plumbing scope-of-works document. These clauses protect both the homeowner (by clearly communicating what is not included, allowing accurate budgeting) and the plumber (by defining the limits of their responsibility).

### Template Exclusion Clauses

#### Clause 1: Fixture and Fittings Supply

> "The supply of plumbing fixtures and fittings (including but not limited to taps, mixers, basins, sinks, toilets, shower heads, bath spouts, and floor waste grates) is excluded from this scope unless explicitly listed as 'supply and install' for a specific item. All fixtures are to be owner-supplied, WaterMark certified, and WELS rated as required. Fixtures must be delivered to site prior to the plumber's scheduled fit-off date."

#### Clause 2: Appliance Supply

> "The supply of plumbing-connected appliances (including but not limited to dishwashers, washing machines, hot water systems, water filters, and garbage disposal units) is excluded unless explicitly listed as 'supply and install' for a specific item. Plumber will connect owner-supplied appliances. Owner is responsible for ensuring appliances are suitable for the installation location and compliant with Australian standards."

#### Clause 3: Waterproofing

> "Waterproofing of wet areas (bathrooms, showers, laundry) is excluded from this scope. Waterproofing must be carried out by a licensed waterproofer in accordance with AS 3740:2021 and NCC Part 10.2 after plumbing rough-in is complete and before tiling commences. A waterproofing compliance certificate must be obtained."

#### Clause 4: Tiling and Tile Repair

> "All tiling works including supply and installation of wall tiles, floor tiles, and associated materials (adhesive, grout, tile trim) are excluded. Repair or replacement of tiles disturbed during plumbing work is excluded and is the homeowner's responsibility."

#### Clause 5: Core Drilling and Concrete Cutting

> "Core drilling through concrete slabs and concrete cutting/trenching for drainage modifications are [included/excluded — specify based on project]. If excluded, a specialist concrete cutter is to be engaged by the homeowner. GPR scanning to locate reinforcement prior to concrete penetration is excluded."

#### Clause 6: Council and Authority Fees

> "All council inspection fees, water authority connection/disconnection fees, plumbing compliance certificate fees, and other regulatory charges are excluded from this scope and are payable separately."

#### Clause 7: Asbestos

> "Testing, removal, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials are excluded. If suspected asbestos is encountered during work, all work will cease until a licensed asbestos removalist has assessed and cleared the area. Associated costs are the homeowner's responsibility."

#### Clause 8: Structural Modifications

> "Structural modifications including concrete slab cutting, modification of load-bearing walls, cutting or notching of structural framing, and any work requiring structural engineer approval are excluded from this scope."

#### Clause 9: Sewer Line Repair

> "Repair, relining, or replacement of existing sewer and stormwater drainage lines is excluded unless specifically included as a line item. If existing drainage is found to be damaged, non-compliant, or obstructed, repairs will be quoted as a variation."

#### Clause 10: Making Good

> "Restoration of walls, floors, and ceilings after plumbing work — including plastering, rendering, painting, tiling, and concrete reinstatement — is excluded and is to be arranged by the homeowner with the appropriate finishing trades."

#### Clause 11: Electrical Work

> "All electrical work (including power connections for hot water systems, dishwashers, and other plumbing-connected appliances; installation of power points; and any electrical modifications) is excluded and must be carried out by a licensed electrician."

#### Clause 12: Gas Fitting (if applicable)

> "Gas fitting work is [included / excluded]. [If excluded:] A licensed gas fitter is required for gas line installation, appliance connection, testing, and gas compliance certification."

#### Clause 13: Painting and Decorating

> "All painting, decorating, and surface finishing works are excluded from this scope."

#### Clause 14: Demolition

> "Demolition of existing fittings, fixtures, cabinetry, wall linings, floor coverings, and other building elements is excluded unless explicitly listed as an inclusion (e.g., 'remove and dispose of existing toilet suite'). Site clean-up and waste removal is [included for plumbing debris only / excluded — specify]."

#### Clause 15: Permits and Design

> "Design fees, architectural drawings, engineering assessments, development applications, construction certificates, and any other professional or regulatory design services are excluded."

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 6.14 Standard Assumptions

### Purpose

Assumptions are statements about the existing conditions that the plumber's scope and pricing are based on. If any assumption proves incorrect, the plumber is entitled to re-quote or issue a variation. Assumptions must be clearly stated in the scope so the homeowner understands the basis of the quote.

### Standard Plumbing Scope Assumptions

#### 6.14.1 Water Supply Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | "Existing water supply pressure and flow rate are adequate for the proposed installation." | If water pressure is too low (below ~200 kPa at the meter), a pressure pump or mains upgrade may be needed — this is not included. If pressure is too high (above 500 kPa), a pressure-limiting valve is required. | HIGH |
| A2 | "Existing water supply pipes are in serviceable condition and suitable for connection to new work." | If existing copper, galvanised, or polybutylene pipes are corroded, leaking, or non-compliant, replacement may be needed — this is a variation. | HIGH |
| A3 | "Existing hot water system is adequate for the proposed fixtures." | If the renovation adds fixtures (e.g., new ensuite), the existing hot water system may be undersized. Upgrading the hot water system is not included unless specified. | HIGH |
| A4 | "Mains water supply shut-off is accessible and functional." | If the main stop cock is seized, buried, or inaccessible, additional work is required to isolate the water supply. | MEDIUM |

#### 6.14.2 Drainage Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A5 | "Existing drainage is in serviceable condition and free-flowing." | If existing drains are cracked, root-affected, collapsed, or incorrectly graded, repairs are a variation. See Section 6.9. | HIGH |
| A6 | "Existing sewer vent system is adequate and compliant." | If additional venting is required (e.g., for relocated fixtures), this may add to scope and cost. | HIGH |
| A7 | "Floor and wall substrates are suitable for drainage installation." | If the concrete slab is too thin, cracked, or contains post-tensioning cables, drainage installation may be more complex or require engineering. | MEDIUM |
| A8 | "Drainage falls can be achieved within the available floor depth." | If the existing floor-to-ceiling height or slab-to-joist depth is insufficient for required drainage falls, a raised floor (hob) or alternative drainage solution may be needed. | HIGH |

#### 6.14.3 Access Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A9 | "Clear and unobstructed access is provided to all work areas." | If furniture, stored items, or other obstructions prevent access, the homeowner must clear the area before the plumber arrives. Plumbers do not move furniture. | HIGH |
| A10 | "Safe and level access is provided to the property and work areas." | Scaffolding, elevated work platforms, and confined space equipment are not included unless specified. | MEDIUM |
| A11 | "Work areas are free of hazardous materials (asbestos, lead paint, mould, contaminated soil)." | See Section 6.7 for asbestos. If other hazards are present, additional safety measures and costs apply. | HIGH |
| A12 | "Power and water are available on site for plumbing work." | Plumbers require access to mains water (for testing) and mains power (for tools). If the site has no power or water (e.g., vacant property with services disconnected), temporary supply must be arranged. | MEDIUM |

#### 6.14.4 Regulatory and Compliance Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A13 | "The proposed work does not require a development application (DA) or construction certificate (CC)." | If a DA or CC is required (e.g., for work affecting building structure or external appearance), this is the homeowner's responsibility to obtain before work commences. | HIGH |
| A14 | "The proposed work complies with current AS/NZS 3500:2025 and the Plumbing Code of Australia (NCC Volume Three)." | All plumbing work commenced from 20 October 2025 must comply with the 2025 edition of AS/NZS 3500. | HIGH |
| A15 | "No heritage listing, conservation order, or body corporate restrictions apply to the property that would limit plumbing work." | Heritage-listed properties and strata units may have restrictions on modifications. These must be confirmed before work commences. | MEDIUM |

#### 6.14.5 Coordination Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A16 | "Other trades (demolition, waterproofing, tiling, electrical, building) are coordinated to allow the plumber timely access for both rough-in and fit-off stages." | If the plumber arrives on site and cannot work because other trades are running behind schedule, the plumber may charge a return visit fee. | HIGH |
| A17 | "Fixture selections are confirmed and products are on site before the fit-off date." | If fixtures are not available when the plumber is scheduled for fit-off, a return visit will be required at additional cost. | HIGH |
| A18 | "Waterproofing will be completed by others between plumbing rough-in and tiling." | The plumber schedules fit-off after tiling. If waterproofing or tiling is delayed, the fit-off is delayed. | HIGH |

#### 6.14.6 Site Condition Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Why It Matters | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A19 | "No rock, groundwater, or unexpected subsurface conditions will be encountered during excavation." | If rock or high groundwater is present, excavation costs increase significantly (rock breaking, dewatering). | MEDIUM |
| A20 | "The property is on a reticulated sewer system (not septic)." | If the property is on a septic system, different regulations and approvals apply. Modifications to septic systems may require council and environmental approval. | MEDIUM |
| A21 | "Existing building construction is standard timber-framed, brick veneer, or masonry. No unusual construction methods that would complicate pipe installation." | Unusual construction (rammed earth, hempcrete, SIPs, post-tensioned slabs) may require different installation methods and additional cost. | LOW |

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Include a dedicated "Assumptions" section in every plumbing scope.
- Select relevant assumptions from the above list based on project type, property age, and property type.
- For apartments/units: Add body corporate and structural slab assumptions.
- For older properties: Add water pressure, pipe condition, and asbestos assumptions.
- For slab-on-ground properties: Add drainage fall and concrete condition assumptions.
- Always include access, coordination, and fixture availability assumptions.

**Confidence:** HIGH (for the assumption framework); individual assumption relevance is MEDIUM-HIGH depending on project context.

## 6.15 Provisional Sums and Allowances

### What It Is

A provisional sum (PS) is an estimated allowance included in a construction contract to cover the cost of work or materials that cannot be precisely defined at the time the contract is entered into. A prime cost (PC) item is an allowance for the supply of specific goods (e.g., fixtures and fittings) where the homeowner has not yet made their final selection.

In the plumbing context, provisional sums are used to budget for items that are likely to be needed but whose exact scope and cost are unknown until work begins.

### Legal Framework

Provisional sums and prime cost items are regulated under state building legislation:

| State | Legislation | Key Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Home Building Act 1989, Part 2 | Builder must provide a reasonable estimate. If actual cost differs, a written variation notice is required. |
| **VIC** | Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995 | Provisional sums must be a reasonable pre-estimate. Builder must provide written notice of variations. |
| **QLD** | Domestic Building Contracts Act 2000 | A provisional sum is an amount the builder, after making all reasonable enquiries, cannot state a definite amount for when entering the contract. |
| **TAS** | Residential Building Work Contracts and Dispute Resolution Act 2016 | Similar to other states. |

In all states, the builder (or plumber, if contracting directly with the homeowner) must:
1. Clearly identify which items are provisional sums.
2. Provide a reasonable estimate (not deliberately low to win the job).
3. Issue a written variation notice if the actual cost differs from the provisional sum.
4. Credit the homeowner if the actual cost is less than the provisional sum.

### Common Provisional Sum Items in Plumbing

| Item | Why It's a Provisional Sum | Typical Provisional Sum Range (AUD) |
|---|---|---|
| **Sewer line repair** | Condition unknown until CCTV inspection or excavation | $2,000-$8,000 |
| **Asbestos pipe lagging removal** | Extent unknown until walls/ceilings opened | $500-$4,000 |
| **Rock excavation** (for drainage trenches) | Subsurface conditions unknown | $1,000-$5,000 |
| **Water pressure booster pump** | May be required if pressure test reveals inadequate supply pressure | $1,500-$4,000 |
| **Hot water system upgrade** | May be required if existing system is undersized for new fixture count | $2,000-$7,000 |
| **Additional drainage modifications** | May be required if existing drainage layout is more complex than anticipated | $1,000-$5,000 |
| **Fixture supply** (PC items) | Homeowner has not yet selected specific products | Varies by fixture — see Section 6.1 |

### How the AI Scope Generator Should Handle Provisional Sums

- The AI should NOT include provisional sums in the standard scope items — they belong in a separate "Provisional Sums and Allowances" section.
- Each provisional sum should include:
  - A description of the item
  - Why it is provisional (what is unknown)
  - A realistic dollar range
  - A note that the actual cost will be confirmed once the work is assessed and that the homeowner will receive a credit if the cost is lower or a variation notice if it is higher
- Recommended wording: "The following provisional sums are included as budget allowances for work that may be required but cannot be definitively scoped at this time. If the work is not required, these amounts will be credited in full. If the actual cost exceeds the provisional sum, a variation will be issued for approval before proceeding."

**Confidence:** HIGH (legal framework); MEDIUM (specific dollar ranges — these vary significantly by project and location)

## 6.16 Warranty and Defects Period

### What It Is

Warranty in the plumbing context covers three separate types of guarantee:

1. **Statutory warranty** — Imposed by state legislation, regardless of what the contract says. Cannot be contracted out of.
2. **Workmanship warranty** — The plumber's guarantee that their installation is defect-free and performed to code.
3. **Product/manufacturer warranty** — The warranty provided by the manufacturer of fixtures, fittings, and equipment.

### Statutory Warranty Periods by State

| State/Territory | Major Defects | Minor/Non-Structural Defects | Legislation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | 6 years from completion | 2 years from completion | Home Building Act 1989, s18E |
| **VIC** | 10 years (structural); 6 years (non-structural) | 6 years from completion | Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995; Building Act 1993 |
| **QLD** | 6 years 6 months from completion (structural) | 6 months after completion (non-structural) | Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991 |
| **SA** | 5 years from completion | 5 years from completion | Building Work Contractors Act 1995 |
| **WA** | 6 years (structural) | 6 years | Home Building Contracts Act 1991 |
| **TAS** | 6 years (structural) | 6 years | Residential Building Work Contracts and Dispute Resolution Act 2016 |
| **ACT** | 6 years (structural) | 2 years | Building Act 2004 |
| **NT** | 10 years (structural) | — | Building Act 1993 (NT) |

### What Statutory Warranties Cover (Using NSW as Primary Example)

Under the Home Building Act 1989 (NSW), statutory warranties require that:

1. Work is performed with due diligence and skill, in accordance with plans and specifications.
2. All materials used are good, suitable, and new (unless otherwise agreed).
3. Work complies with, and will comply with, all applicable laws, standards, and codes (including AS/NZS 3500:2025 and the Plumbing Code of Australia).
4. Work is performed with reasonable care and skill and completed within a reasonable time.
5. The result is reasonably fit for the purpose communicated by the homeowner.

These warranties apply **automatically** to all residential building work (including plumbing) over $5,000 in NSW. They cannot be waived, excluded, or reduced by contract.

### How Plumbing Defects Are Classified

| Classification | Examples | Warranty Period (NSW) |
|---|---|---|
| **Major defect** (structural or waterproofing failure) | Burst supply pipe causing structural water damage; failed drainage causing sewage backup into building; defective hot water installation causing flooding | 6 years |
| **Minor/non-structural defect** | Dripping tap from poor installation; slow drain due to incorrect fall; minor leak at a fitting joint; noisy pipes due to inadequate securing | 2 years |

**Note:** A plumbing defect that initially appears minor (e.g., a slow leak behind a wall) can be reclassified as a major defect if it causes or threatens structural damage.

### Product/Manufacturer Warranties

| Product Type | Typical Manufacturer Warranty | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tapware (quality brands — Caroma, Dorf, Grohe, etc.) | 5-15 years | Covers manufacturing defects. Does not cover wear items (washers, cartridges) or damage from incorrect installation or poor water quality. |
| Toilet suites | 5-10 years | Covers ceramic body and cistern components. Does not cover seats, hinges, or consumable parts. |
| Hot water systems (electric/gas storage) | 5-10 years on cylinder; 1-2 years on components | Warranty may be void if not installed by a licensed plumber. Anode replacement requirements must be met. |
| Hot water systems (heat pump) | 5-7 years on compressor; 1-2 years on other components | Requires annual maintenance in some cases. |
| PEX/copper pipe | 25-50 years (pipe material warranty) | Pipe material warranties are extremely long; the workmanship warranty on connections is more relevant. |
| PVC drainage pipe | 15-50 years (pipe material warranty) | Similar to supply pipe — connections and fall are the workmanship element. |

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Include a warranty section in every plumbing scope.
- State the statutory warranty period for the relevant state (based on the homeowner's property location).
- Distinguish between workmanship warranty (plumber's responsibility) and product warranty (manufacturer's responsibility).
- Include wording such as:

> "Plumbing workmanship is warranted for the statutory warranty period applicable in [state]: [X years] for major defects and [X years] for non-structural defects from the date of completion. This warranty covers defects in workmanship and materials supplied by the plumber. Product warranties for owner-supplied fixtures and fittings are provided by the respective manufacturers and are not covered by the plumber's warranty."

- Note that statutory warranties cannot be excluded or limited by contract.
- For owner-supplied fixtures: Clearly state that the plumber does not warranty the product, only the installation.

### What Is NOT Covered by Warranty

Standard warranty exclusions (not covered by either statutory or workmanship warranty):

- Damage caused by misuse, abuse, or neglect by the homeowner
- Damage caused by other trades working after the plumber has completed their work
- Damage caused by failure to maintain (e.g., not replacing hot water system anode rods)
- Wear and tear on consumable items (tap washers, O-rings, cartridge seals)
- Damage caused by poor water quality (e.g., bore water causing scale buildup)
- Damage caused by freezing (relevant in alpine areas)
- Damage caused by ground movement, subsidence, or tree root intrusion
- Cosmetic issues with owner-supplied fixtures (scratches, discolouration)
- Changes to building regulations after the work was completed (work only needs to comply with the regulations current at the time of installation)

**Confidence:** HIGH (statutory warranty framework is legislated); MEDIUM (product warranty ranges vary by brand)

## 6.17 Electrical Work

### What It Is

Many plumbing installations require electrical connections that the plumber cannot perform. A licensed electrician is required for:

- Power supply to electric hot water systems
- Power supply to heat pump hot water systems
- Power supply to dishwashers (dedicated circuit)
- Power supply to garbage disposal units
- Power supply to instant boiling water units
- Electrical connection for underfloor heating (in conjunction with wet area plumbing)
- Disconnection and reconnection of electrical services during renovation

### Why Electrical Work Is Excluded

Plumbers are not licensed electricians. Under Australian WHS legislation and state electrical safety regulations, only a licensed electrician may perform electrical work. A plumber who performs electrical work is committing a criminal offence, voiding insurance, and creating a safety hazard.

### Scope Language

> "All electrical work — including but not limited to power supply connections for hot water systems, dishwashers, garbage disposal units, and any other plumbing-connected appliances — is excluded from this plumbing scope and must be carried out by a licensed electrician."

### Coordination Point

The plumber and electrician must coordinate on several items:

| Item | Plumber's Responsibility | Electrician's Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Hot water system location | Determine location and plumb connections | Run dedicated circuit to location |
| Dishwasher location | Plumb water supply and drainage | Provide dedicated GPO in cabinet |
| Heated towel rail | N/A (usually electrical, not plumbed) | Power supply and connection |
| Exhaust fan | N/A (usually electrical, but may involve duct connection) | Power supply, switch, and ductwork |

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

## 6.18 Painting and Decorating

### What It Is

After plumbing work is complete, affected surfaces (walls with pipe chases, ceiling patches, areas around new fixtures) require painting to match existing finishes. This is always excluded from the plumbing scope.

### Scope Language

> "All painting, decorating, and surface finishing works — including painting of patched walls, ceilings, and any surfaces affected by plumbing work — are excluded from this scope."

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

## 6.19 Permit and Design Fees

### What It Is

Some plumbing projects, particularly those involving layout changes, additional fixtures, or work in strata/apartment buildings, may require:

- Development application (DA) or complying development certificate (CDC)
- Construction certificate (CC)
- Strata/body corporate approval
- Hydraulic engineering design (for complex installations)
- Architect or building designer input

### Scope Language

> "All permit fees, design fees, engineering assessments, development applications, construction certificates, and professional consultant fees are excluded from this scope. These are the homeowner's responsibility to obtain prior to commencement of plumbing work."

**Confidence:** HIGH
