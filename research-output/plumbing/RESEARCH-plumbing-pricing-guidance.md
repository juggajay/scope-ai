# SECTION 7: PRICING GUIDANCE (FOR PC SUMS ONLY)

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER FOR AI SYSTEM:** These prices are indicative ballpark ranges only, sourced from publicly available Australian cost guides and plumber websites (2024-2026). They are intended to help the AI flag approximate budget ranges to homeowners (e.g., "budget approximately $X-$Y for this item"). They are NOT quotes. Actual costs vary significantly by location, access, existing conditions, pipe material, floor construction (slab vs timber), and individual plumber pricing. The AI should always recommend obtaining 2-3 quotes from licensed plumbers.

## 7.1 Plumber Hourly Rates by City

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

| City | Standard Hourly Rate (Mon-Fri) | Call-Out / Service Fee | After-Hours / Emergency Rate |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Sydney** | $110 - $180/hr | $80 - $250 | $180 - $300+/hr |
| **Melbourne** | $90 - $180/hr | $80 - $300 | $150 - $280+/hr |
| **Brisbane** | $85 - $160/hr | $50 - $150 | $140 - $250/hr |
| **Perth** | $90 - $165/hr | $60 - $180 | $145 - $260/hr |
| **Adelaide** | $80 - $140/hr | $70 - $120 | $120 - $220/hr |

**Key notes:**
- Most plumbers charge a call-out fee covering the first 30-60 minutes on site. Some roll the call-out into the first hour; others charge it separately -- always confirm in writing
- After-hours is typically anything outside Mon-Fri 7am-5pm. Weekends and public holidays attract premium rates (1.5x to 2x standard)
- Sydney commands the highest rates nationally due to cost of living, traffic (longer travel times), licensing requirements (NSW is heavily regulated), and high demand
- Many renovation plumbing jobs are quoted as fixed-price rather than hourly, especially where the scope is clearly defined
- Plumbers often charge in 15-minute or 30-minute blocks, so even short jobs can add up quickly
- Rates for specialist work (gas fitting, backflow, drainage) may be higher than general plumbing rates
- An apprentice on site typically reduces the effective hourly rate but is billed at approximately $40-$60/hr

## 7.2 Call-Out and Minimum Charge Ranges

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

| Scenario | Typical Range |
|----------|--------------|
| **Standard business hours call-out** | $60 - $200 |
| **After-hours call-out** | $120 - $300 |
| **Weekend call-out** | $150 - $300 |
| **Public holiday call-out** | $150 - $400 |
| **Emergency / urgent call-out** | $200 - $400+ |
| **Minimum charge (small job)** | $150 - $300 |

**Key notes:**
- The call-out fee is a fixed amount covering travel time and initial diagnosis. Once the plumber assesses the issue, they will provide a quote for the actual work -- either hourly or fixed price
- Some plumbers waive the call-out fee if you proceed with the repair
- The minimum charge is effectively the call-out fee plus the minimum billable time (typically 30-60 minutes of labour)
- For renovation work, call-out fees are generally not applicable as the plumber is quoting for a defined scope of work
- Always ask: "What is your minimum charge?" and "Is the call-out fee included in the quoted price?"

## 7.3 Rough-In Per Point

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (ranges vary significantly by source and context)

A "plumbing point" refers to a single connection -- either a water supply point (hot or cold) or a waste/drainage point. Rough-in means installing the pipework to the correct position within walls or floors before fixtures are installed.

### New Point Installation

| Point Type | Cost Range (Labour + Materials) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Water supply point (new)** | $150 - $400 per point | Hot or cold; PEX or copper pipe run from nearest supply |
| **Waste/drainage point (new)** | $250 - $600 per point | Higher cost due to gravity requirements, fall calculations, and larger pipe sizes |
| **Combined hot + cold + waste (new fixture)** | $500 - $1,200 per fixture | Three points minimum for most fixtures |

### Relocated Point

| Point Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Water supply point (relocated)** | $200 - $500 per point | Depends on distance moved and pipe accessibility |
| **Waste point (relocated, timber floor)** | $300 - $700 per point | Easier access under timber floors |
| **Waste point (relocated, concrete slab)** | $600 - $1,500+ per point | Requires slab cutting, which is significantly more expensive |

**Key notes:**
- "Per point" pricing is commonly used in new builds but less common in renovation quotes, where plumbers tend to quote per fixture or per room
- The cost per point drops significantly when multiple points are being installed in the same area (economy of scale)
- Waste points are always more expensive than supply points because drainage pipes are larger (40mm-100mm vs 15-20mm for supply), must maintain correct fall (1:40 to 1:60 gradient), and may require venting
- Relocating points on a concrete slab is substantially more expensive than on a timber-framed floor due to the need for concrete cutting and re-making good

## 7.4 Toilet Supply and Rough-In

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

### Toilet Suite Supply Costs (Unit Only)

| Toilet Type | Supply Cost Range | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| **Close-coupled (standard)** | $250 - $1,200 | Most common in Australian homes; cistern sits on back of pan |
| **Back-to-wall** | $400 - $1,300 | Cistern concealed in wall or furniture unit |
| **Wall-faced** | $650 - $1,400 | Pan sits flush against wall, cleaner look |
| **Wall-hung** | $300 - $5,000+ | Requires in-wall frame and concealed cistern |
| **Smart toilet / bidet seat** | $1,700 - $5,000+ | Integrated wash functions, heated seat, etc. |

### Concealed Cistern Supply Costs

| Product | Supply Cost Range | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| **Geberit Sigma 8 (back-to-wall)** | $300 - $500 | Fits standard 90mm wall; Swiss-designed, German-made |
| **Geberit Sigma 8 with DuoFix frame (wall-hung)** | $700 - $900 | Includes mounting frame for wall-hung pans |
| **Geberit Omega (compact)** | $350 - $600 | Lower height for under-counter installations |
| **Other brands (R&T, Caroma in-wall)** | $200 - $450 | Budget-friendly alternatives |

### Toilet Installation Labour Costs

| Installation Type | Labour Cost Range | Typical Duration |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Like-for-like replacement (same trap type)** | $150 - $400 | 1-2 hours |
| **S-trap to P-trap conversion (or vice versa)** | $400 - $800 | 2-4 hours; requires waste pipe modification |
| **New location (timber floor)** | $600 - $1,200 | 3-5 hours; new waste run required |
| **New location (concrete slab)** | $1,200 - $2,500+ | 4-8 hours; slab cutting, new drainage |
| **Wall-hung with concealed cistern (new)** | $800 - $1,500 | 4-6 hours; frame installation, in-wall plumbing |
| **Concealed cistern retrofit** | $600 - $1,200 | 3-5 hours; wall modification, cistern installation |

### S-Trap vs P-Trap

| Detail | S-Trap | P-Trap |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Waste exit direction** | Through the floor (downward) | Through the wall (horizontal) |
| **Common in** | Timber-floor homes, ground floor on slab | Upper floors, apartments, newer builds |
| **Set-out measurement** | Distance from wall to centre of floor outlet | Height from floor to centre of wall outlet |
| **Conversion cost** | $400 - $800+ to change trap type | Includes waste pipe rerouting and possibly floor/wall work |

**Key notes:**
- Bunnings offers a toilet installation service from $275 (like-for-like replacement of a standard toilet)
- Old toilet removal and disposal typically adds $30-$100
- Always confirm the trap type (S-trap or P-trap) and the set-out measurement before purchasing a new toilet suite
- Concealed cisterns (particularly Geberit) carry up to 15-year warranty and 50-year spare parts availability, which justifies the premium
- Wall-hung toilets require the wall to be properly reinforced, which may involve carpentry work (not included in plumber's quote)
- If switching from a standard toilet to a wall-hung toilet, the entire waste configuration changes -- budget accordingly

## 7.5 Shower Mixer and Waste Rough-In

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (fewer itemised sources for rough-in specifically)

### Shower Mixer Rough-In

| Configuration | Labour + Materials Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Standard mixer rough-in (same position)** | $200 - $500 | Replacing like-for-like; minimal pipe modification |
| **Standard mixer rough-in (new position)** | $400 - $800 | New hot/cold supply runs within wall cavity |
| **Diverter mixer (shower + bath spout)** | $300 - $600 | Two outlet diverter; single rough-in body |
| **Rain shower head rough-in (ceiling mount)** | $400 - $900 | Requires pipe run through ceiling space; higher if no ceiling access |
| **Separate hand shower + rain shower** | $500 - $1,000 | Two rough-in bodies or diverter system |
| **Thermostatic mixer rough-in** | $400 - $800 | More complex rough-in body; anti-scald protection |

### Shower Waste Rough-In

| Configuration | Labour + Materials Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Standard centre waste (same position)** | $150 - $350 | 50mm or 80mm floor waste, standard grate |
| **Standard centre waste (new position, timber)** | $300 - $600 | New waste run under floor |
| **Standard centre waste (new position, slab)** | $600 - $1,500+ | Slab cutting required |
| **Linear / strip drain** | $500 - $1,200 | Longer waste channel; more complex fall requirements |
| **Linear drain (new position, slab)** | $1,000 - $2,000+ | Significant slab modification |

### Combined Shower Rough-In (Mixer + Waste + Arm)

| Configuration | Total Labour + Materials | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Standard shower (same position)** | $400 - $900 | Mixer rough-in + waste + shower arm point |
| **Standard shower (new position, timber floor)** | $800 - $1,500 | New supply runs + new waste |
| **Standard shower (new position, slab)** | $1,500 - $3,000+ | All new pipework + slab cutting |
| **Premium shower (rain head + hand shower + linear drain)** | $1,200 - $2,500 | Multiple rough-in points, linear drain installation |

**Key notes:**
- Shower mixer rough-in bodies must be installed before waterproofing -- coordination with the waterproofer is critical
- Rain shower heads mounted in the ceiling require adequate ceiling cavity space and access; if the pipe run is long or through an inaccessible ceiling, costs increase
- Linear drains are increasingly popular in modern bathrooms but cost more to install due to the longer waste channel, more complex fall requirements, and higher precision needed for tile laying (tiler cost also increases)
- The plumber installs the rough-in body and waste; the tiler and waterproofer work around these. All three trades must coordinate
- Mixer rough-in heights should be confirmed before installation: standard shower mixer is typically 1000-1100mm from FFL (finished floor level); bath/shower diverter is typically 150-200mm above the bath rim
- Shower mixer supply (the fixture itself) is NOT included in rough-in costs -- this is typically a PC sum or homeowner-supplied item

## 7.6 Bath Rough-In

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (limited itemised data for rough-in specifically)

### Built-In Bath (Alcove / Drop-In / Inset)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Bath rough-in (same position, like-for-like)** | $300 - $700 | Hot + cold supply, waste connection; existing pipework reused where possible |
| **Bath rough-in (new position, timber floor)** | $600 - $1,200 | New supply and waste runs |
| **Bath rough-in (new position, slab)** | $1,200 - $2,500+ | Slab cutting for waste relocation |
| **Bath/shower mixer rough-in** | $250 - $500 | Wall-mounted mixer with diverter |
| **Bath spout rough-in (wall mounted)** | $150 - $350 | Single supply point through wall |

### Freestanding Bath

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Freestanding bath rough-in (timber floor)** | $800 - $1,800 | Floor waste + concealed supply runs; more complex than built-in |
| **Freestanding bath rough-in (slab)** | $1,500 - $3,000+ | Slab penetration for waste; supply runs through floor |
| **Floor-mounted bath spout rough-in** | $400 - $900 | Requires in-floor box connection or flexi-hose; pipe run through floor |
| **Floor-mounted mixer rough-in** | $500 - $1,000 | More complex; hot + cold supply through floor to mixer body |
| **Wall-mounted filler for freestanding bath** | $300 - $600 | Simpler if wall is nearby; supply runs through wall |

### Bath Removal and Disposal

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| **Old bath removal** | $300 - $600 |
| **Cast iron bath removal** | $500 - $1,000+ |
| **Bath disposal** | $50 - $150 |

**Key notes:**
- Freestanding baths are significantly more expensive to rough-in than built-in baths because the supply and waste must come through the floor rather than the wall
- Floor-mounted bath spouts and mixers require the rough-in body to be installed in the floor before waterproofing and tiling -- the plumber needs the exact bath position and the specific rough-in body early in the build
- For freestanding baths on a concrete slab, the waste penetration through the slab is the major cost driver
- The bath itself (supply) is not included in rough-in costs
- Freestanding bath installation (connection to pre-installed rough-in) is typically a separate fit-off charge of $200-$500

## 7.7 Vanity/Basin Rough-In

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (combined from multiple sources)

### Vanity Installation by Type

| Vanity Type | Total Installed Cost (Supply + Labour) | Plumbing Labour Only |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Floor-standing vanity (like-for-like)** | $800 - $2,000 | $150 - $400 |
| **Floor-standing vanity (new position)** | $1,200 - $3,000 | $400 - $900 |
| **Wall-hung vanity (like-for-like)** | $1,000 - $2,500 | $250 - $600 |
| **Wall-hung vanity (new position)** | $1,500 - $4,000 | $500 - $1,200 |
| **Double basin vanity** | $1,800 - $5,000+ | $400 - $1,000 |
| **Above-counter basin** | $800 - $2,500 | $200 - $500 |

### Rough-In Specifics

| Configuration | Labour + Materials Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Single basin rough-in (same position)** | $200 - $500 | Hot + cold supply + waste; reusing existing pipework |
| **Single basin rough-in (new position, timber)** | $400 - $900 | New supply runs + new waste |
| **Single basin rough-in (new position, slab)** | $800 - $1,500+ | Slab cutting for waste relocation |
| **Double basin rough-in (same area)** | $500 - $1,200 | Two sets of supply + shared or dual waste |
| **Wall-hung vanity bracket support** | $150 - $400 | May require carpenter for wall reinforcement (separate cost) |

**Key notes:**
- Wall-hung vanities require the wall to be properly reinforced with a timber or steel backing plate, which is typically carpentry work (not included in plumber's quote)
- For wall-hung vanities, the waste pipe typically exits through the wall rather than the floor, which affects the rough-in configuration
- Double basins require twice the supply points but may share a single waste connection with a Y-junction
- The vanity unit itself is not included in rough-in costs
- Basin mixers and pop-up wastes are typically homeowner-supplied (PC sum items)
- A standard vanity rough-in includes: 2x water supply points (hot + cold) + 1x 40mm waste point

## 7.8 Kitchen Sink Rough-In

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented in kitchen renovation guides)

| Configuration | Labour + Materials Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Connect sink and mixer (same position)** | $350 - $700 | Like-for-like replacement; reuse existing pipework |
| **New sink position (short move, < 1m)** | $600 - $1,200 | Extended pipe runs from existing supply/waste |
| **New sink position (relocated, > 1m)** | $900 - $2,500 | Significant re-routing; may need new waste fall |
| **New sink position (slab)** | $1,500 - $3,500+ | Slab cutting for waste relocation |
| **Undermount sink connection** | $400 - $800 | Standard connection; stonemason cuts the hole (separate) |
| **Butler/farmhouse sink connection** | $400 - $900 | May require modified waste height |

**Key notes:**
- Kitchen sinks require hot + cold supply (15-20mm) and a 50mm waste connection
- Moving the sink even 500mm can add $500+ to the plumbing cost because the waste line gradient must be maintained
- If the sink is moving to a different wall, the plumber must run new supply lines and a new waste connection -- this is the single biggest cost driver in kitchen plumbing
- Sink and mixer supply (the actual fixtures) are not included in these rough-in costs
- Kitchen waste typically connects to a 50mm branch line running to the main 100mm drain stack
- In apartments and multi-storey buildings, waste connections may be more complex due to shared drainage stacks

## 7.9 Island Bench Plumbing

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (limited specific data; compiled from renovation forums and guides)

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Island sink + dishwasher (timber floor)** | $1,500 - $3,500 | Supply + waste runs under floor to island location |
| **Island sink + dishwasher (concrete slab)** | $2,500 - $6,000+ | Slab cutting, waste run under slab, re-making good |
| **Island sink only (timber floor)** | $1,000 - $2,500 | Simpler if close to existing drainage |
| **Island sink only (concrete slab)** | $2,000 - $5,000+ | Slab penetration is the major cost driver |
| **Slab cutting and core drilling (plumber's portion)** | $500 - $1,500 | May require specialist concrete cutter (separate cost) |

**Key notes:**
- Island bench plumbing is one of the most expensive kitchen plumbing items due to the need for floor penetrations and long pipe runs
- On a concrete slab, the waste line must run through or under the slab to reach the drainage stack -- this often requires a concrete cutter and significant labour
- Many experienced plumbers and builders recommend AGAINST island sinks on slabs because: the waste run is long and flat (prone to blockages), there is no easy access for future maintenance, and the cost is disproportionate to the benefit
- If the island is positioned close to an exterior wall or existing drainage, costs can be lower
- Venting is a significant consideration for island sinks -- an air admittance valve (AAV) may be required within the island cabinetry
- Hot and cold water supply to the island is simpler (PEX can be run through the slab) but the waste is the challenge
- Always get a specific quote for island bench plumbing -- the range is very wide depending on slab thickness, distance to drain, and accessibility

## 7.10 Dishwasher Connection

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented across multiple sources)

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Like-for-like replacement (existing connections)** | $60 - $180 | Simply connecting hoses to existing supply and waste |
| **New dishwasher to existing connections** | $150 - $250 | Standard connection to kitchen sink supply and waste |
| **New dishwasher (new plumbing connections)** | $300 - $600 | New water supply point + waste connection |
| **Complex installation (cabinet modification)** | $400 - $800+ | Non-standard location, extended pipe runs |
| **Old dishwasher removal and disposal** | $30 - $100 | If done by the plumber at time of installation |

### Breakdown of Connection Components

| Component | Cost Range |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Water supply connection (cold only)** | $100 - $250 |
| **Waste connection (to sink waste)** | $80 - $200 |
| **Supply + waste combined** | $150 - $400 |
| **Power point (electrician, if needed)** | $140 - $250 |

**Key notes:**
- Most dishwashers connect to the cold water supply only (the dishwasher heats its own water)
- The waste hose typically connects to the kitchen sink waste via a dishwasher spigot on the trap
- If there is no existing dishwasher connection, the plumber needs to install a mini stop valve (isolating valve) on the cold water supply and a spigot on the sink waste trap
- Power supply is the electrician's responsibility, not the plumber's -- a dedicated power point is required near the dishwasher location
- In most Australian states, a licensed plumber must make the water connections -- this is not a DIY job for the water supply and waste
- The dishwasher unit itself is not included in these costs
- Water pressure must be at least 200kPa for proper dishwasher function (AS/NZS 3500 requirement)

## 7.11 Gas Cooktop Connection

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented; licensed gas fitter required)

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Connect to existing bayonet fitting** | $100 - $250 | Simple connection; quick job |
| **New bayonet fitting (short gas run)** | $200 - $500 | From existing gas line nearby |
| **New bayonet fitting (extended gas run)** | $400 - $800 | Longer pipe run from gas meter or main |
| **New gas line from meter to kitchen** | $500 - $1,500+ | Full new gas line; depends on distance and routing |
| **Gas cooktop supply and install (total)** | $300 - $1,200 | Includes connection, testing, and compliance certificate |

### Gas Fitter Hourly Rates

| City | Gas Fitter Rate |
|------|----------------|
| **Sydney** | $90 - $130/hr |
| **Melbourne** | $85 - $120/hr |
| **Brisbane** | $80 - $110/hr |
| **Perth** | $85 - $120/hr |
| **Adelaide** | $80 - $110/hr |

**Key notes:**
- Only a licensed gas fitter (or plumber with gas fitting endorsement) can legally install or modify gas appliances in Australia
- All gas work must be tested for leaks and a compliance certificate issued
- The distance from the gas supply to the cooktop location is the primary cost driver -- if the gas needs to run through the roof space, down another wall, or across a long distance, costs increase significantly
- Gas cooktops require a dedicated gas bayonet fitting -- they cannot share a fitting with another appliance
- The cooktop unit itself is not included in these costs
- Natural gas and LPG connections differ -- ensure the gas fitter knows which type before ordering the cooktop (most cooktops come set up for natural gas with an LPG conversion kit)

## 7.12 Gas to Electric/Induction Changeover

**Confidence:** HIGH (increasingly common; well-documented due to electrification trend)

### Cost Breakdown

| Component | Cost Range | Trade Required |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Gas line capping (disconnect + cap)** | $150 - $500 | Licensed gas fitter / plumber |
| **Electrical circuit for induction cooktop** | $500 - $2,000 | Licensed electrician |
| **Switchboard upgrade (if needed)** | $500 - $2,500 | Licensed electrician |
| **Total changeover (excluding cooktop)** | $1,000 - $4,000 | Both plumber and electrician |
| **Total changeover (including mid-range cooktop)** | $2,000 - $8,000 | Before rebates |

### Gas Capping Detail

| Scenario | Cost Range | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Simple cap at bayonet** | $150 - $250 | Gas fitter caps the existing bayonet fitting |
| **Cap and remove gas line to cooktop** | $200 - $400 | More thorough; removes unused gas pipe section |
| **Cap at meter + remove entire kitchen gas line** | $300 - $600+ | If going fully electric and no other gas appliances |
| **Full gas disconnection (no gas appliances remaining)** | $400 - $800 | Disconnect from gas main; involves gas distributor |

**Key notes:**
- Induction cooktops require a dedicated 32-amp circuit (sometimes 40-amp for larger models) -- this is the electrician's major cost item
- If the existing switchboard does not have spare capacity, a switchboard upgrade may be needed, adding $500-$2,500 to the electrical portion
- The gas fitter's role is limited to safely disconnecting and capping the gas supply -- this is usually the smaller portion of the changeover cost
- Victorian Energy Upgrades (VEU) program offers rebates for switching from gas to induction cooktops -- check current rebate amounts at the time of quoting
- Other states may have similar incentive programs -- always check for available rebates
- The changeover requires two separate trades: a licensed gas fitter/plumber AND a licensed electrician
- A compliance certificate must be issued for the gas disconnection work

| **Solar (electric boosted)** | $400 - $550 |

**Key notes:**
- Hot water system replacement is one of the most common plumbing jobs and is well-standardised in pricing
- Like-for-like replacement is always the cheapest option because existing connections (electrical, gas, water, drainage) can be reused
- Changeover from gas to heat pump is the most popular upgrade path in 2025-2026, driven by government rebates and rising gas prices
- Always factor in the cost of the tempering valve (mandatory in most states -- see Section 7.15)
- The old system must be disconnected, drained, and removed -- disposal is usually included in the quote but confirm
- For gas systems, a gas compliance certificate must be issued
- Plumbing regulations require the pressure relief valve to discharge to a visible and safe location

| **Mid-range system after rebates** | $2,000 - $3,500 |
| **Premium system after rebates** | $3,500 - $5,500 |

### Installation Specifics

| Scenario | Installation Labour | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Replacing existing electric (reusable circuit)** | $600 - $1,000 | Simplest installation; reuse wiring |
| **Replacing existing gas** | $1,000 - $1,800 | New electrical circuit from switchboard + gas capping |
| **New installation (no existing system)** | $1,200 - $2,000 | Full plumbing + electrical from scratch |
| **Difficult access / tight spaces** | Add $300 - $800 | Heat pumps need adequate airflow space |

**Key notes:**
- Heat pumps are the recommended replacement for both electric and gas hot water systems in 2025-2026 due to efficiency (COP of 3-4, meaning 3-4x more efficient than electric resistance)
- Heat pumps need adequate outdoor space with good airflow -- they cannot be installed in enclosed spaces
- Noise can be a consideration -- some councils have noise regulations for heat pump placement near boundaries
- The most popular brands in Australia (2025) are Rheem, Stiebel Eltron, Reclaim Energy, Sanden, iStore, Rinnai, and Dux
- Reclaim Energy and Sanden are split systems (compressor unit separate from tank) which offer more flexible installation but higher cost
- Australian-made heat pumps (Rheem, Dux, Rinnai) attract a bonus rebate in Victoria
- STCs (the federal rebate) are usually deducted at point of sale by the installer -- you do not need to apply separately
- Always confirm the warranty period: 5-10 years on compressor is standard; some brands offer up to 15 years
- Most rebates can only be claimed once per household

## 7.15 Tempering Valve Supply and Install

**Confidence:** HIGH (mandatory requirement; well-documented)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Tempering valve (supply only)** | $80 - $200 | Standard residential valve |
| **Solar tempering valve (supply only)** | $150 - $300 | Higher temperature rating for solar systems |
| **Installation labour** | $100 - $300 | Typically 1-2 hours work |
| **Total supply and install** | $200 - $500 | Standard residential installation |
| **Total supply and install (solar-rated)** | $300 - $600 | For solar or heat pump systems |
| **Replacement (existing valve)** | $250 - $450 | Including removal of old valve |

**Key notes:**
- A tempering valve is MANDATORY in all Australian states for hot water systems that store water above 60 degrees C (which is required to prevent Legionella bacteria growth)
- The tempering valve blends hot water with cold water to deliver water at a safe temperature (typically 50 degrees C maximum) to bathroom outlets
- Kitchen sinks are usually exempt from tempering valve requirements (hot water can be delivered at full temperature)
- The tempering valve is typically installed on the hot water outlet pipe, close to the hot water system
- Must comply with AS 4032.1 (Thermostatic mixing valves)
- Tempering valves should be tested annually and replaced every 5-8 years
- When replacing a hot water system, the plumber should always check and potentially replace the tempering valve -- this is often a separate line item on the quote
- Some plumbers include the tempering valve in their hot water system installation quote; others list it separately. Always confirm.

## 7.16 Backflow Prevention Device

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (pricing varies by device type and council requirements)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Hose connection vacuum breaker (HCVB)** | $30 - $80 | Simplest type; screws onto garden taps |
| **Dual check valve (DCV)** | $50 - $150 | Residential mains connection; low hazard |
| **Reduced pressure zone device (RPZ)** | $300 - $800 | Commercial-grade; high hazard applications |
| **Installation labour** | $150 - $400 | 1-3 hours depending on device type |
| **Total supply and install (residential DCV)** | $200 - $500 | Most common residential scenario |
| **Total supply and install (RPZ)** | $500 - $1,200 | Less common in residential |
| **Annual testing (mandatory)** | $150 - $320 | Required by water authority; first valve |
| **Additional valve testing** | $100 - $150 each | Per additional valve on same visit |

**Key notes:**
- Backflow prevention is required by water authorities (e.g., Sydney Water, Melbourne Water, Urban Utilities) to prevent contaminated water flowing back into the mains supply
- The type of device required depends on the hazard level at the property -- residential homes typically need a dual check valve at minimum
- Properties with rainwater tanks connected to internal plumbing, pools with autofill, or irrigation systems may require a higher-rated RPZ device
- Annual testing is mandatory and must be conducted by a licensed plumber with backflow testing accreditation
- In NSW, backflow testing typically costs $220 for the first valve + $132 for each additional valve (includes logging results with Sydney Water)
- The device must be installed at the property's point of connection to the water main
- Council or water authority may require registration of the backflow device
- Some renovation work triggers a requirement for backflow prevention to be installed or upgraded -- check with your local water authority

## 7.17 Pressure Limiting Valve

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (limited specific pricing data)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Pressure limiting valve (supply only)** | $40 - $120 | Standard 15mm or 20mm residential valve |
| **Installation labour** | $80 - $200 | Typically 30-60 minutes if accessible |
| **Total supply and install** | $110 - $300 | Standard residential installation |
| **Replacement (existing valve)** | $150 - $350 | Including removal of old valve |
| **Pressure testing (diagnostic)** | $80 - $150 | To determine if PLV is needed |

**Key notes:**
- A pressure limiting valve (PLV) is required where mains water pressure exceeds 500kPa (AS/NZS 3500.1)
- High water pressure can damage plumbing fittings, mixers, and appliances (dishwashers, washing machines)
- Symptoms of high water pressure include: noisy pipes (water hammer), leaking mixer cartridges, frequent washer failures, and short appliance lifespan
- The PLV is typically installed at the water meter or where the mains enters the property
- PLVs should be checked periodically and replaced every 10-15 years
- Installing a PLV can save money long-term by reducing wear on fixtures and appliances
- Many newer suburbs already have PLVs installed by the water authority
- If your plumber identifies high water pressure during a renovation, installing a PLV should be recommended as part of the scope

## 7.18 Sewer/Drainage Modification

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (wide range due to high variability)

### Minor Drainage Work

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Relocate one waste point (timber floor)** | $300 - $800 | Short extension of existing drainage |
| **Relocate one waste point (slab)** | $800 - $2,000 | Slab cutting + re-making good |
| **New floor waste (timber floor)** | $250 - $600 | Standard 80mm or 100mm floor grate |
| **New floor waste (slab)** | $600 - $1,500 | Core drilling + new waste connection |

|------|-----------|
| **Concrete slab cutting (per linear metre)** | $150 - $400/m |
| **Core drilling through slab** | $200 - $500 per hole |
| **Excavation (hand digging)** | $80 - $150/hr |
| **Excavation (mini excavator)** | $200 - $400/hr |
| **Reinstatement (concrete, paving, landscaping)** | $500 - $3,000 |
| **Council/authority inspection fee** | $200 - $800 |

**Key notes:**
- Drainage work is the most variable cost in residential plumbing because it depends heavily on depth, soil type, access, and distance to the main sewer
- In older homes (pre-1970s), drainage may be earthenware or cast iron, which is more expensive to modify or connect to
- Tree root intrusion is the most common cause of sewer line damage in Australian homes
- Pipe relining (trenchless repair) is an increasingly popular alternative to full replacement, typically 30% cheaper and less disruptive
- Council or water authority approval may be required for any work on the sewer main or within a defined easement
- Stormwater and sewer are separate systems in most Australian cities -- never connect them
- A drainage camera inspection ($150-$500) before starting renovation work can identify existing issues and avoid costly surprises during construction

## 7.19 Full Bathroom Plumbing Rough-In

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented as a standard renovation scope)

### Standard Bathroom (Shower + Toilet + Vanity + Floor Waste)

| Scenario | Total Rough-In Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Same positions (timber floor)** | $1,500 - $3,500 | Reuse existing drainage positions; new supply runs |
| **Same positions (concrete slab)** | $2,000 - $4,500 | Some slab work even with same positions |
| **Partially relocated (timber floor)** | $2,500 - $5,000 | One or two fixtures moving position |
| **Partially relocated (concrete slab)** | $3,500 - $7,000 | Slab cutting for waste relocations |
| **Fully relocated (timber floor)** | $4,000 - $7,000 | Complete new layout; all new pipework |
| **Fully relocated (concrete slab)** | $6,000 - $12,000+ | Extensive slab work; all new drainage |

### Bathroom with Bath (Shower + Toilet + Vanity + Bath + Floor Waste)

| Scenario | Total Rough-In Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Same positions (timber floor)** | $2,000 - $4,500 | Additional bath supply and waste |
| **Same positions (concrete slab)** | $2,500 - $5,500 | Additional slab considerations for bath |
| **Partially relocated (timber floor)** | $3,000 - $6,000 | One or two fixtures moving |
| **Partially relocated (concrete slab)** | $4,500 - $8,500 | More slab work required |
| **Fully relocated (timber floor)** | $5,000 - $9,000 | Complete new layout |
| **Fully relocated (concrete slab)** | $7,000 - $15,000+ | Extensive slab work |

### Typical Line Items in a Bathroom Rough-In Quote

| Item | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Toilet waste rough-in (100mm) | $300 - $800 |
| Toilet cold water supply | $100 - $250 |
| Shower mixer rough-in (hot + cold) | $250 - $600 |
| Shower waste rough-in (50mm or 80mm) | $200 - $500 |
| Shower arm point | $80 - $200 |
| Vanity hot + cold supply rough-in | $200 - $500 |
| Vanity waste rough-in (40mm) | $150 - $350 |
| Floor waste rough-in (80mm or 100mm) | $150 - $400 |
| Bath supply rough-in (if applicable) | $200 - $500 |
| Bath waste rough-in (if applicable) | $200 - $500 |
| Bath spout rough-in (if applicable) | $100 - $300 |
| Washing machine taps rough-in (if combined) | $200 - $400 |

**Key notes:**
- The single biggest cost difference is slab vs timber floor construction. If you are renovating a bathroom on a concrete slab, expect 40-80% higher plumbing rough-in costs compared to timber floor construction
- "Same position" means the fixtures are going back in the same location -- the plumber connects to existing drainage positions (much cheaper)
- "Relocated" means one or more fixtures are moving to a new position, requiring new drainage runs
- The rough-in must happen BEFORE waterproofing, tiling, and fixture installation
- Rough-in and fit-off are typically quoted separately: rough-in is the pipework in walls/floors; fit-off is connecting fixtures after tiling
- Fit-off (connecting all fixtures after tiling) typically adds $800-$2,000 to the bathroom cost
- The plumber must coordinate with the waterproofer: all rough-in bodies must be correctly positioned and clamped before the waterproof membrane is applied
- Floor wastes are mandatory in all wet areas in Australia (AS/NZS 3500)

| Pot filler tap rough-in (if applicable) | $200 - $500 |
| Under-sink instant hot water tap (if applicable) | $150 - $300 |
| Relocate plumbing points (per point) | $200 - $600 |

### Kitchen Fit-Off (After Benchtops Installed)

| Item | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Connect sink and mixer | $150 - $400 |
| Connect dishwasher | $100 - $250 |
| Connect gas cooktop | $100 - $250 |
| Test and commission | Included |
| **Total kitchen fit-off** | $350 - $900 |

**Key notes:**
- Kitchen plumbing is typically split into rough-in (before cabinetry) and fit-off (after benchtops)
- The biggest cost driver is whether the sink position is changing -- keeping the sink in the same location saves significant money
- Gas cooktop connection requires a licensed gas fitter (many plumbers hold this endorsement)
- If switching from gas to induction, the plumber caps the gas and the electrician installs the new circuit (see Section 7.12)
- Kitchen waste connects to 50mm branch drainage; the dishwasher typically shares the sink waste connection via a spigot
- For island bench sinks, see Section 7.9 for detailed pricing
- Plumbing in Sydney is among the most expensive nationally: kitchen plumbing rates are $110-$180/hr

## 7.21 Laundry Plumbing Rough-In

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (less itemised data available; compiled from broader sources)

### Standard Laundry (Trough + Washing Machine Taps + Floor Waste)

| Scenario | Total Rough-In Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Same position (existing connections)** | $600 - $1,500 | Reuse existing supply and waste |
| **Minor relocation** | $1,000 - $2,500 | Short move of trough or washing machine taps |
| **Full relocation** | $2,000 - $4,500 | New location; all new pipework |
| **New laundry (from scratch)** | $2,500 - $5,000+ | Full new plumbing for trough, washing machine, and waste |

### Typical Line Items

| Item | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Laundry trough hot + cold supply | $200 - $500 |
| Laundry trough waste (40mm) | $150 - $350 |
| Washing machine taps (hot + cold) | $200 - $500 |
| Washing machine waste standpipe or outlet box | $100 - $300 |
| Floor waste (80mm) | $150 - $400 |
| Dryer exhaust vent (if ducted externally) | $100 - $300 |

### Laundry Fit-Off

| Item | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Connect trough and mixer | $100 - $300 |
| Connect washing machine taps | $80 - $200 |
| Install floor grate | $50 - $150 |
| **Total laundry fit-off** | $200 - $600 |

**Key notes:**
- Laundry plumbing is generally the simplest and cheapest of the three wet areas (bathroom, kitchen, laundry)
- Washing machine connections require: hot + cold supply taps (quarter-turn taps are standard), and a 40mm waste outlet (standpipe or outlet box)
- A floor waste is required in all laundries in Australia (AS/NZS 3500)
- Modern laundry outlet boxes (e.g., Allproof) combine washing machine taps, waste, and overflow into a single in-wall unit -- these cost $80-$200 for the unit plus installation
- If the laundry is being relocated (e.g., from a separate room to under the stairs or in the bathroom), the waste fall and venting requirements must be carefully considered
- Keeping the laundry in its existing position saves significant cost -- avoid relocating taps and drains unless absolutely necessary

## 7.22 Outdoor Tap Installation

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented; common service)

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Replace existing garden tap (like-for-like)** | $100 - $250 | Simple swap; 30-60 minutes |
| **New garden tap (short pipe run from existing supply)** | $200 - $400 | Tee off existing line; through external wall |
| **New garden tap (extended pipe run)** | $350 - $600 | Longer run from main supply |
| **New garden tap (remote location)** | $500 - $1,000+ | Long pipe run across property |
| **Frost-proof garden tap** | $250 - $500 | Required in cold climate areas |
| **Hose tap timer installation** | $50 - $150 | If done at same time as tap work |

**Key notes:**
- Bunnings offers a garden tap installation service from $199 for like-for-like replacement of up to 3 garden taps
- Garden taps should have a backflow prevention device (hose connection vacuum breaker) to prevent contamination of the drinking water supply
- The pipe material for outdoor runs is typically copper or PEX (UV-protected if exposed)
- If the pipe run is external and exposed, it should be lagged (insulated) in frost-prone areas
- Some councils require garden taps to be connected to the rainwater tank (not mains) for outdoor use -- check local regulations

## 7.23 Rainwater Tank Connection

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies significantly by scope and state regulations)

### Plumbing Connection Only (Tank Already Installed)

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Connect tank to toilet cisterns** | $500 - $1,500 | Requires pump, mains switching device, and dedicated pipework |
| **Connect tank to washing machine** | $400 - $1,200 | Similar to toilet connection |
| **Connect tank to garden taps only** | $300 - $800 | Simplest connection; gravity-fed or with small pump |
| **Connect tank to toilet + washing machine + garden** | $1,000 - $2,500 | Full internal connection with switching device |
| **Mains water switching device (supply + install)** | $800 - $1,500 | Automatic switch to mains when tank is empty |

### Full Tank and Pump Package

| Configuration | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Small poly tank (2,000-3,000L) + pump** | $1,000 - $2,500 | Basic setup; garden use |
| **Medium poly tank (5,000L) + pump + switching device** | $1,500 - $4,000 | Full residential setup |
| **Large tank (10,000L+) + pump + switching device** | $3,000 - $8,000+ | Larger properties or BASIX compliance |
| **Underground tank** | $4,000 - $12,000+ | Excavation adds significant cost |

### Component Costs

| Component | Cost Range |
|-----------|-----------|
| Pump (surface-mounted) | $200 - $600 |
| Pump (submersible) | $300 - $900 |
| Pressure tank (20-40L) | $100 - $300 |
| Mains water switching device | $400 - $800 |
| First flush diverter | $50 - $200 |
| Tank screen / filter | $100 - $500 |
| Pump cover / housing | $100 - $300 |

**Key notes:**
- In NSW, BASIX (Building Sustainability Index) requirements often mandate rainwater tank connection for new builds and major renovations
- Similar sustainability requirements exist in other states (e.g., 6 Star energy rating requirements)
- Rainwater used for internal purposes (toilets, washing machine) requires a mains water switching device to ensure supply continuity
- If rainwater is connected to internal plumbing, a backflow prevention device is typically required at the mains water meter
- The tank and pump are separate from the plumbing connection -- many homeowners purchase the tank directly and engage a plumber for connections
- Council approval may be required for tank placement, particularly in heritage areas or where tanks are visible from the street
- Pumps require an electrical connection (electrician's work, not plumber's)

## 7.24 Re-Piping

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (wide range; highly dependent on property specifics)

### Pipe Material Costs (Supply Only)

| Material | Cost Per Metre | Typical Use |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **PVC (drainage)** | $3 - $6/m | Drainage and waste lines |
| **PEX (cross-linked polyethylene)** | $5 - $15/m | Hot and cold water supply; flexible |
| **Copper** | $10 - $25/m | Hot and cold water supply; traditional |
| **Galvanised steel** | $6 - $10/m | Legacy pipes; rarely used for new work |
| **HDPE (high-density polyethylene)** | $8 - $20/m | Larger supply lines; mains connections |

### Re-Piping Labour and Total Costs

| Scope | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Single section repair/replacement** | $250 - $750 | Localised patch; 1-3 hours |
| **Per water supply point (replace pipe to fixture)** | $300 - $600 | New PEX or copper from manifold to fixture |
| **Single room re-pipe (e.g., bathroom)** | $1,500 - $4,000 | All supply lines in one room |
| **Full house re-pipe (small, 2-bed)** | $5,000 - $12,000 | All water supply lines replaced |
| **Full house re-pipe (medium, 3-bed)** | $8,000 - $20,000 | All water supply lines replaced |
| **Full house re-pipe (large, 4+ bed)** | $12,000 - $25,000+ | Extensive pipe network |
| **Full drainage re-pipe** | $5,000 - $20,000 | All waste and drainage lines |

### Common Re-Piping Scenarios

| Scenario | Cost Range | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Replace galvanised with PEX (per point)** | $300 - $600 | Most common upgrade; galvanised corrodes internally |
| **Replace galvanised with copper (per point)** | $400 - $800 | Premium option; longer lifespan |
| **Replace lead pipes** | $2,000 - $8,000+ | Rare but critical health issue; pre-1930s homes |
| **Replace polybutylene (grey poly)** | $3,000 - $15,000 | Prone to failure; common in 1980s-1990s homes |

### Additional Costs

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| **Excavation (if underground)** | $500 - $2,000 |
| **Permits and inspections** | $100 - $1,000 |
| **Interior repairs (walls, flooring)** | $1,000 - $3,000 |
| **Fittings and components** | $100 - $500 |

### Pipe Material Lifespan Guide

| Material | Expected Lifespan |
|----------|-------------------|
| **PVC (drainage)** | 25 - 50 years |
| **PEX** | 40 - 50 years |
| **Copper** | 50 - 100 years |
| **Galvanised steel** | 20 - 50 years (often less due to internal corrosion) |
| **Cast iron (drainage)** | 50 - 100 years |
| **Earthenware (drainage)** | 50 - 100 years (but prone to root intrusion) |
| **Polybutylene** | 10 - 15 years (known failure issues) |

**Key notes:**
- The most common re-piping scenario in Australian renovations is replacing old galvanised steel water supply pipes with PEX or copper
- Galvanised pipes corrode internally over time, reducing water flow and discolouring water -- if you see brown water or reduced pressure, galvanised pipes may need replacing
- PEX has become the preferred material for residential water supply due to lower cost, easier installation, resistance to corrosion, and flexibility (fewer joints = fewer potential leak points)
- Copper remains a premium option with the longest lifespan but costs more in both material and labour
- A full house re-pipe is a major project that typically requires cutting into walls and floors, followed by repair (patching, painting) -- the make-good cost is often significant
- For renovation projects, re-piping is best done during the rough-in phase when walls and floors are already open
- If only part of the house is being renovated, consider re-piping the whole house while walls are open -- the incremental cost is much lower than doing it later

## 7.25 Factors Affecting Pricing

**Confidence:** HIGH (universally agreed upon across all sources)

### Primary Cost Factors

| Factor | Impact on Price | Details |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Floor construction (slab vs timber)** | +40% to +100% for slab | Concrete slab work requires cutting, core drilling, and re-making good. Timber floors provide easy access from below |
| **Access difficulty** | +20% to +50% | Narrow spaces, ceiling cavities, under-floor crawl spaces, or areas behind fixed cabinetry all increase time and cost |
| **Multi-storey properties** | +15% to +40% | Upper floor work requires longer pipe runs, potentially scaffolding, and more complex drainage (gravity requirements) |
| **Age of property** | +10% to +50% | Older properties may have non-standard pipe sizes, degraded fittings, asbestos materials, or lead pipes |
| **Distance of pipe runs** | Variable | Longer runs from water main or drainage stack = more materials + more labour |
| **Number of fixtures** | Economy of scale | Cost per fixture decreases when multiple fixtures are done in the same area |
| **Fixture complexity** | Variable | Wall-hung toilets, freestanding baths, and rain showers cost more to rough-in than standard fixtures |
| **Location (city)** | Sydney highest; Adelaide lowest | Up to 30-40% difference between most and least expensive capital cities |
| **Time of year** | +10% to +30% in peak season | Summer (hot water failures) and winter (burst pipes) are peak seasons for plumbers |

### Secondary Cost Factors

| Factor | Impact | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Pipe material choice** | Variable | Copper costs more than PEX; some homeowners or plumbers prefer one over the other |
| **Compliance requirements** | +$200 to +$1,000 | Gas compliance certificates, drainage inspections, backflow testing |
| **Coordination with other trades** | Time cost | If the plumber must return multiple times (rough-in, then fit-off), each visit incurs travel time |
| **Site conditions** | Variable | Inner-city terrace with no side access vs suburban house with clear access |
| **Waste disposal** | +$100 to +$500 | Old fittings, pipe offcuts, removed hot water systems need disposal |
| **After-hours work** | +50% to +100% | If plumbing must be done outside standard hours for building management or strata requirements |

---

## 7.26 When Pricing Increases Significantly

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented cost escalation scenarios)

### Slab Penetration

| Scenario | Additional Cost | Details |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Single waste point through slab** | +$500 - $1,500 | Core drilling + waste connection below slab |
| **Multiple waste points through slab** | +$1,500 - $5,000+ | Multiple penetrations; may need mini excavator under slab |
| **Full bathroom on slab (new layout)** | +$3,000 - $8,000 | Extensive slab cutting for new drainage layout |

Slab work is the single most significant cost escalator in residential plumbing. A bathroom renovation on a timber floor might cost $2,000-$4,000 for plumbing rough-in, while the same scope on a concrete slab could be $4,000-$10,000+.

### Asbestos Encounters

| Scenario | Additional Cost | Details |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Asbestos cement pipe removal (small section)** | +$500 - $2,000 | Licensed asbestos removalist required |
| **Asbestos cement sheeting around pipes** | +$1,000 - $5,000 | Removal before plumbing work can proceed |
| **Asbestos in wall/floor cavities** | +$2,000 - $10,000+ | Full remediation may be required |
| **Asbestos testing (per sample)** | $30 - $80 | Always test suspect materials in pre-1990 homes |

Asbestos cement pipes and sheeting were commonly used in Australian homes built before 1990. If asbestos is encountered during plumbing work, the plumber must stop work and engage a licensed asbestos removalist. This can add significant cost and delay to the project.

### Heritage Properties

| Scenario | Additional Cost | Details |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Heritage overlay approval process** | +$500 - $3,000+ | Council heritage assessment; 8-12 week delay typical |
| **Sympathetic materials/methods** | +20% to +50% | May need copper rather than PEX; concealed rather than surface-mounted |
| **Restricted access / preservation constraints** | +30% to +100% | Cannot cut into heritage fabric; creative routing required |
| **Heritage consultant fees** | $500 - $2,000 | May be required by council before approval |

### Other Cost Escalators

| Scenario | Additional Cost | Details |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **Narrow site access (terrace house, no side access)** | +$1,000 - $5,000 | Materials must be hand-carried; no machine access |
| **Apartment / strata building** | +$500 - $3,000 | Building management requirements, restricted work hours, shared drainage considerations |
| **Lead pipe discovery** | +$2,000 - $8,000+ | Must be replaced entirely; health hazard |
| **Unexpected tree root intrusion** | +$500 - $3,000 | Root cutting or pipe relining/replacement |
| **Building defects discovered during work** | Variable | Rot, structural issues, previous non-compliant work |
| **Requirement for temporary water supply** | +$200 - $500 | If water must be shut off for extended period |

## 7.27 How to Read a Plumber's Quote

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on industry guidance and plumber websites)

### What a Good Plumbing Quote Should Include

A professional plumbing quote for renovation work should clearly itemise the following:

| Section | What to Look For |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Scope of work** | Specific description of each task, location within the property, and what is being done (e.g., "Supply and install new 15mm PEX hot and cold water supply to shower mixer position in ensuite bathroom") |
| **Labour costs** | Either an hourly rate with estimated hours, or a fixed price for the defined scope. If hourly, the total estimate should be provided |
| **Materials** | Key materials listed with specifications (e.g., pipe type, valve brands). Standard consumables (tape, glue, clamps) are usually included in the price |
| **PC sums / provisional sums** | Items where the final cost depends on homeowner selection (e.g., "PC sum of $500 for shower mixer and rail -- supply by owner") |
| **Inclusions** | Clearly state what IS included: permits, compliance certificates, testing, cleanup |
| **Exclusions** | Clearly state what is NOT included: electrical work, structural modifications, tiling, waterproofing, fixture supply, wall patching |
| **Assumptions** | Conditions the quote is based on (e.g., "assumes timber floor access from below" or "assumes existing drainage positions are reusable") |
| **Variations clause** | How unforeseen work will be handled and priced (should require written approval before proceeding) |
| **Timeline** | Estimated duration and key milestones (rough-in date, fit-off date) |
| **Warranty** | Labour warranty period (standard is 1-7 years; some offer lifetime) and material warranty (manufacturer's warranty, separate from labour) |
| **Licence and insurance** | Current plumbing licence number, public liability insurance, and workers compensation insurance |

### Hourly vs Fixed Price

| Pricing Model | Best For | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Fixed price** | Defined scope work (bathroom rough-in, hot water replacement, fixture installation) | Cost certainty; easier to compare quotes; no surprises | Plumber may build in buffer for unknowns; less flexible if scope changes |
| **Hourly rate** | Diagnostic work, fault-finding, emergency repairs, work where scope is unclear | Only pay for time actually spent; flexible | Hard to budget; costs can escalate; harder to compare quotes |
| **Hybrid** | Emergency work that leads to defined repair | Hourly for diagnosis, then fixed price for repair | Need clear transition point between hourly and fixed |

### Red Flags When Reviewing a Quote

| Red Flag | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **No licence number shown** | Unlicensed plumbing work is illegal and uninsurable |
| **No itemisation (single lump sum only)** | Cannot compare with other quotes; hard to identify what is/is not included |
| **No exclusions listed** | Risk of disputes about what is covered |
| **No assumptions stated** | Quote may change dramatically if conditions differ |
| **Unusually low price** | May indicate corners being cut, unlicensed work, or a "get in the door" price with variations to follow |
| **No warranty mentioned** | Professional plumbers stand behind their work |
| **Verbal quote only** | Always get it in writing |
| **No compliance certificate mentioned** | Gas work and certain plumbing work requires compliance certificates |
| **"Plus materials at cost"** | Open-ended; materials should be estimated or capped |
| **No variations process** | Unforeseen work should require written approval before proceeding |

### Tips for Comparing Quotes

1. **Get 2-3 quotes** for any plumbing work over $500
2. **Ensure quotes are for the same scope** -- if one plumber includes items that another excludes, adjust for comparison
3. **Check that all quotes include GST** -- some plumbers quote ex-GST
4. **Ask about the rough-in vs fit-off split** -- some quote them together, others separately
5. **Confirm what "make-good" means** -- does the plumber patch walls and concrete after cutting, or is that the builder's responsibility?
6. **Ask about access requirements** -- does the plumber need the builder to open walls/floors, or will they do it themselves?
7. **Check the plumber's licence** on the relevant state authority website (e.g., NSW Fair Trading, VBA in Victoria, QBCC in Queensland)
8. **Ask about payment terms** -- a deposit (10-20%) is normal for larger jobs; balance on completion. Never pay 100% upfront
9. **Confirm the timeline** -- when will the plumber be available for rough-in, and when for fit-off? This must align with the overall renovation schedule
10. **Request a written variations process** -- any changes to scope should be documented and approved before work proceeds

### Understanding Common Quote Line Items

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Rough-in** | Installing pipes within walls, floors, and ceilings before fixtures are installed. Happens early in the renovation |
| **Fit-off** | Connecting fixtures (taps, toilets, basins, etc.) to the pre-installed pipework. Happens after tiling/painting |
| **PC sum (Prime Cost sum)** | An allowance for an item that the homeowner will select (e.g., tapware). The plumber includes a budget amount; actual cost may differ |
| **Provisional sum** | An estimate for work that cannot be precisely priced until conditions are revealed (e.g., "provisional sum of $800 for any required slab cutting") |
| **Day works** | Work charged at hourly rates, typically for unforeseen issues |
| **Make good** | Repairing surfaces (walls, floors, concrete) after cutting or drilling for pipe access |
| **Compliance certificate** | Official document certifying that plumbing/gas work meets Australian Standards |
| **Point** | A single plumbing connection (supply or waste) |
| **Stack** | The main vertical drainage pipe that all fixtures connect to |
| **Fall** | The gradient (slope) required for drainage pipes to flow correctly by gravity |
