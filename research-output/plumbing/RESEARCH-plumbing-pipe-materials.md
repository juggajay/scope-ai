### 1.2 Material Selection Hierarchy for Renovations

In Australian residential renovations, the plumber's choice of pipe material is typically driven by:

1. **Application** — Water supply (hot/cold) vs drainage vs gas — each has different approved materials
2. **Access** — Renovation work in existing walls/floors vs new work with open access
3. **Connection to existing** — What pipe material is already installed (transition fittings add cost)
4. **Plumber preference** — Most plumbers are trained on and prefer one PEX system (Auspex OR Rehau)
5. **Cost** — Material + labour combined cost
6. **Compliance** — State and local authority requirements

### 1.3 Market Share (Australian Residential — Water Supply)

| Material | Approximate Market Share (New Residential) | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| PEX (all types) | ~60% | Dominant and growing |
| Copper | ~25% | Declining but stable in premium/heritage |
| Multilayer (PEX-AL-PEX) | ~10% | Growing, especially gas and hydronic |
| Other (CPVC, PP, etc.) | ~5% | Niche |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (industry estimates, not official data)

---

## 2. WaterMark Certification & Lead-Free Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH (direct regulatory references)

### 2.1 WaterMark Certification Scheme

The WaterMark Certification Scheme is a **mandatory** product certification scheme administered by the Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB). All plumbing products installed in Australian buildings must carry WaterMark certification where listed in the Schedule of Products.

**Key requirements:**
- Licensed plumbers may **only** install WaterMark-certified products for regulated plumbing work
- Products must comply with the relevant AS/NZS standard AND pass AS/NZS 4020 testing (for products in contact with drinking water)
- The WaterMark logo must be visible on the product or packaging
- Non-compliant installations may be rejected by plumbing inspectors and may void insurance

**Scope impact:** Every pipe and fitting specified in a scope of works must be WaterMark-certified. Scope documents should include the phrase "All materials to be WaterMark certified to relevant Australian Standards."

### 2.2 Lead-Free Requirements (Effective 1 May 2026)

**This is a critical change taking effect during the active life of this product.**

From **1 May 2026**, new national requirements mandate that all plumbing products installed in contact with drinking water must contain **no more than 0.25% lead** (weighted average). This affects:

| Affected Products | Examples |
|---|---|
| Copper alloy fittings | Brass valves, compression fittings, tee pieces |
| Taps and mixers | Kitchen taps, bathroom basin mixers |
| Valves | Ball valves, gate valves, check valves |
| Backflow prevention devices | RPZ valves, dual check valves |
| Water meters | All residential water meters |
| Water heaters | Hot water system components |

**Exempt products** (not in constant contact with drinking water): shower heads, washing machines, dishwashers, commercial HVAC boilers, emergency deluge showers.

**Transition:** Until 1 May 2026, plumbers may install existing WaterMark-certified products. From 1 May 2026, only products displaying both the **WaterMark** and **Lead-Free** logos are authorised.

**Scope impact:** All scopes generated after May 2026 should specify "Lead-free WaterMark certified fittings" for all water supply connections. This particularly affects brass fittings used with copper pipe.

## 3. Copper Pipe

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-established, AS 1432 referenced directly)

### 3.1 Overview

Copper has been the traditional pipe material for Australian plumbing for over 70 years. While PEX has overtaken copper in new residential construction by market share, copper remains widely used in renovations, especially:

- Heritage and premium homes where copper is preferred or required
- Gas installations (internal copper gas lines)
- Connections to existing copper systems where transition fittings would be impractical
- Exposed pipe runs where appearance matters
- Hot water system connections (final connections to storage tanks and tempering valves)

### 3.2 Australian Standard — AS 1432:2004 (R2016)

AS 1432 specifies requirements for round seamless copper tubes for plumbing, gasfitting, and drainage applications. Tubes are classified into **four types** based on wall thickness:

| Type | Colour Code | Wall Thickness | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Type A** | Green | Thickest | Heavy-duty, industrial, high-pressure |
| **Type B** | Blue | Standard | **Standard residential plumbing** (most common) |
| **Type C** | Red | Thinner | Light-duty residential, some water authorities |
| **Type D** | Black | Thinnest | Drainage, non-pressure applications only |

**Type B is the standard for Australian residential plumbing.** Type C is permitted by some water authorities for low-pressure applications but is less common.

### 3.3 Type B Copper Pipe — Dimensions (Residential Sizes)

| Nominal Size | Outside Diameter (mm) | Wall Thickness (mm) | Internal Diameter (mm) | Safe Working Pressure (kPa) | Common Application |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 mm (1/2") | 15.88 | 0.91 | 14.06 | ~3,800 | Individual fixture supply (basin, toilet) |
| 20 mm (3/4") | 19.05 | 1.02 | 17.01 | ~3,500 | Branch lines, hot water runs |
| 25 mm (1") | 25.40 | 1.22 | 22.96 | ~3,100 | Main supply lines within building |
| 32 mm (1-1/4") | 31.75 | 1.42 | 28.91 | ~2,900 | Main supply, larger fixtures |
| 40 mm (1-1/2") | 38.10 | 1.22 | 35.66 | ~2,100 | Sub-mains, multi-unit supply |
| 50 mm (2") | 50.80 | 1.42 | 47.96 | ~1,800 | Building main supply |

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS 1432 specifications — values are standard reference)

**Supply form:**
- **Hard drawn (straight lengths):** 6-metre lengths, used for exposed and fixed pipe runs
- **Annealed (soft/coil):** 15m or 30m coils, used for concealed runs, bending around obstacles

### 3.4 Connection Methods

#### 3.4.1 Soldering (Silver Solder / Capillary)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Heat pipe and fitting with oxy-acetylene or MAPP gas torch, apply flux and silver solder alloy |
| **Solder type** | Lead-free silver solder (minimum 2% silver content for potable water — "plumber's solder"). Lead-based solder has been **illegal** for potable water in Australia for decades |
| **Alloy types** | 2% silver (economical, general plumbing), 5% silver (stronger), 15% silver "phos-copper" (copper-to-copper and HVAC) |
| **Joint strength** | Excellent — permanent, full-pressure rated |
| **Skill required** | High — requires proper flux application, correct heat, and capillary action technique |
| **Fire risk** | Open flame required — hot work permit may be needed in renovation context, fire blankets mandatory near combustible materials |
| **Speed** | Slow — each joint requires individual heating, soldering, cooling |
| **Inspection** | Visual inspection — clean, uniform fillet of solder around joint |
| **Standard** | AS 1432, AS/NZS 3500.1 |
| **Best for** | Final connections, exposed work, heritage renovations, connections to existing copper |
| **Avoid when** | Working near combustible framing, in confined roof spaces, bulk installation |

#### 3.4.2 Press-Fit (Kempress / Viega Propress)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Cut pipe square, deburr, insert into fitting, compress with hydraulic press tool using profile-specific jaws |
| **Systems** | **Kempress** (MM Kembla — Australian, 2-point press) and **Viega Propress** (German, 3-point press, "Smart Connect" leak detection) |
| **Joint strength** | Excellent — equal to or exceeding soldered joints |
| **Skill required** | Medium — correct pipe preparation essential, but no flame skills needed |
| **Fire risk** | None — flameless connection |
| **Speed** | Fast — each connection takes seconds once pipe is prepared. Installation time approximately **21% faster** than brazed fittings |
| **Fitting cost** | Higher than solder fittings (approximately 2-3x per fitting) |
| **Overall cost** | Despite higher fitting cost, overall installation cost is approximately **10% cheaper** than soldered due to labour savings |
| **Tool cost** | Requires hydraulic press tool ($2,000-$5,000+ depending on brand and kit) — most plumbers own or hire |
| **Warranty** | 25 years (both Kempress and Viega) |
| **Design life** | 50 years (Kempress) |
| **Safety feature** | Viega Propress "Smart Connect" — unpressed fittings are guaranteed to leak during pressure testing, making missed connections easily identifiable |
| **Compatibility** | Kempress fittings are compatible with Viega, Rothenberger, Novopress, Milwaukee & Ridgid press tools with Australian-sized jaws |
| **Best for** | Renovation work (no flame), bulk connections, confined spaces, speed-critical projects |
| **Avoid when** | Very small jobs where tooling cost is not justified (use solder instead) |

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer specifications — Kembla, Viega)

#### 3.4.3 Compression Fittings

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Brass body with compression nut and olive — tighten with spanners to compress olive onto pipe |
| **Joint strength** | Good — suitable for concealed and exposed work |
| **Skill required** | Low — no special tools beyond standard spanners |
| **Fire risk** | None |
| **Speed** | Moderate — individual assembly |
| **Cost** | Moderate — fittings are inexpensive but labour is manual |
| **Accessibility** | Can be disassembled and reused — excellent for maintenance points |
| **Best for** | Connections under sinks, to fixtures, maintenance access points, temporary connections |
| **Avoid when** | Concealed in walls (prefer permanent joints), high-vibration locations |

#### 3.4.4 Push-Fit (SharkBite)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Cut pipe square, deburr, push into fitting until it clicks — no tools, no heat, no crimping |
| **Compatible with** | Copper, PEX, CPVC, PE-RT, SDR-9 HDPE — any combination |
| **Joint strength** | Good — suitable for pressure applications |
| **Skill required** | Very low — DIY-level simplicity (but must be installed by licensed plumber for compliance) |
| **Fire risk** | None |
| **Speed** | Very fast — seconds per connection |
| **Cost** | High per fitting — push-fit fittings are the most expensive connection method per joint |
| **Reliability** | Good, but some plumbers are wary of long-term concealed use. O-ring seal may degrade over very long periods |
| **Standards** | SharkBite fittings meet NCC 2022 Vol. 3 lead-free standards |
| **Best for** | Emergency repairs, transitions between pipe materials, renovation work where speed is critical |
| **Avoid when** | Large-scale installations (cost prohibitive), direct burial, extremely high-temperature applications |

**Confidence:** HIGH (SharkBite manufacturer data)

### 3.5 Advantages of Copper in Renovation Context

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| Proven longevity | 50-70+ year lifespan with proper installation |
| Bacterial resistance | Copper is naturally antimicrobial — inhibits biofilm growth |
| UV resistant | Can be used in exposed outdoor applications without degradation |
| High temperature tolerance | Continuous operating temperature well above hot water requirements |
| Fire rating | Non-combustible — important for fire-rated wall assemblies |
| Recyclable | 100% recyclable — environmentally preferred by some specifiers |
| Compatible with existing | Most pre-2000 Australian homes have copper — direct connection without adaptors |
| Heritage appropriate | Required or preferred for heritage-listed properties |

### 3.6 Disadvantages of Copper in Renovation Context

| Disadvantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| Material cost | 3-5x more expensive per metre than PEX |
| Labour cost | Soldered connections require significantly more time than PEX crimp/expansion |
| Fire risk | Soldering requires open flame — problematic in renovation with existing framing |
| Noise | Water hammer and thermal expansion more audible in copper than PEX |
| Corrosion risk | Susceptible to pinhole leaks in aggressive water conditions (low pH, high chloride) |
| Electrolysis risk | Dissimilar metal corrosion when copper contacts galvanised steel without dielectric union |
| Theft risk | Copper has scrap value — theft from building sites is a known problem |
| Rigidity | Cannot be bent around obstacles like PEX — requires fittings for direction changes |

### 3.7 When to Use Copper

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Heritage renovation | **Preferred** — often required by heritage overlay |
| Premium/luxury fit-out | **Preferred** — perceived quality, longevity |
| Connecting to existing copper (limited scope) | **Preferred** — avoid transition fittings for small jobs |
| Gas installation (internal) | **Required** — copper is standard for internal gas runs |
| Exposed pipe runs (feature) | **Preferred** — aesthetically superior |
| Hot water final connections | **Common** — connecting to storage HWS and tempering valves |
| Budget renovation | **Avoid** — PEX is significantly cheaper |
| Full re-pipe behind walls | **Avoid** — PEX is faster, cheaper, and equally reliable |
| Confined spaces with combustibles | **Avoid** — fire risk from soldering (unless using press-fit) |

### 3.8 Cost Comparison (Relative)

| Item | Approximate Cost Range | Rating |
|---|---|---|
| 15mm Type B copper tube (6m length) | $35-$55 | Premium |
| 20mm Type B copper tube (6m length) | $55-$80 | Premium |
| 25mm Type B copper tube (6m length) | $85-$130 | Premium |
| Solder fitting (15mm elbow) | $1.50-$3.00 | Budget |
| Press-fit fitting (15mm elbow) | $5.00-$10.00 | Mid-range |
| Compression fitting (15mm elbow) | $3.00-$6.00 | Budget-Mid |
| Push-fit fitting (15mm elbow) | $8.00-$15.00 | Premium |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (prices fluctuate with copper commodity markets — copper hit record US$11,870/tonne in December 2025)

### 3.9 Australian Manufacturers & Suppliers

## 4. PEX (Cross-Linked Polyethylene)

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 2492 referenced, manufacturer data confirmed)

### 4.1 Overview

PEX (cross-linked polyethylene) is now the **dominant pipe material** for residential water supply in Australia, accounting for approximately 60% of the residential market. PEX is used in more than half of all new home builds across Australia.

PEX is a flexible plastic pipe where the polyethylene molecular chains have been cross-linked (bonded together) to create a stronger, more heat-resistant material than standard polyethylene. The cross-linking process determines the pipe type (PEX-A, PEX-B, or PEX-C).

### 4.2 Australian Standard — AS/NZS 2492:2007

AS/NZS 2492 specifies requirements for cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes for hot and cold water pressure applications. All PEX pipe sold in Australia must:

- Comply with AS/NZS 2492
- Carry WaterMark certification
- Meet AS/NZS 4020 for drinking water contact
- Be rated minimum **PN16** (16 bar at 20 degrees C) for cold water or **PN20** (20 bar at 20 degrees C) for hot water applications
- AS/NZS 3500 requires PN16 or PN20 rated PEX for hot water services

### 4.3 PEX Types — Manufacturing Methods

| Type | Cross-Linking Method | Cross-Linking Degree | Flexibility | Cost | Common in Australia |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PEX-A** | Peroxide (Engel method) — "hot" cross-linking above crystal melting point at 200-250 degrees C | Highest (~75-85%) | Most flexible — 5-6x OD bend radius | Highest | Yes — Rehau RAUTITAN is PEX-A |
| **PEX-B** | Silane (moisture cure) — cross-linking occurs post-extrusion using heat and moisture | Lower (~65-70%) | Less flexible — 8x OD bend radius | Lowest | Yes — Auspex is PEX-B |
| **PEX-C** | Electron beam (irradiation) — cross-linking via radiation exposure | Variable (~60-75%) | Moderate | Mid-range | Less common in Australia |

#### PEX-A vs PEX-B — Key Differences for Scope Purposes

| Attribute | PEX-A | PEX-B |
|---|---|---|
| **Flexibility** | Superior — easier to route through existing walls | Stiffer — still flexible but less forgiving |
| **Kink resistance** | Excellent — kinks can be repaired with heat gun | More prone to kinking — kinks are permanent |
| **Burst pressure** | Lower than PEX-B | **Highest** burst pressure of all PEX types |
| **Oxidation resistance** | Good | **Better** — slightly higher resistance |
| **Memory** | Strong shape memory (returns to shape) | Less shape memory |
| **Connection method** | Expansion fittings (Rehau compression sleeve) | Crimp fittings (Auspex crimp ring) |
| **Price** | Higher per metre | Lower per metre |
| **Australian brands** | Rehau RAUTITAN | Auspex |

**Scope impact:** Both PEX-A and PEX-B are fully compliant and appropriate for all residential water supply applications. The choice is typically driven by the plumber's preference and tooling investment. Do not specify PEX-A vs PEX-B in scope documents — specify by brand system (e.g., "Rehau RAUTITAN" or "Auspex") or simply "PEX pipe to AS/NZS 2492."

### 4.4 PEX Pipe Sizes — Residential Applications

| Nominal Size (OD) | Common Application | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **16 mm** | Individual fixture supply — basins, toilets, dishwashers, washing machines | Most common size for point-of-use connections |
| **20 mm** | Branch lines, shower supply, kitchen sink, bath | Standard for most fixtures requiring higher flow |
| **25 mm** | Main cold water supply within building, hot water supply from HWS | Primary distribution pipe |
| **32 mm** | Sub-main supply, large buildings, multiple wet areas | Less common in single-dwelling residential |

**Note:** PEX sizes refer to the **outside diameter** (OD), unlike copper which uses nominal bore. The internal bore of PEX is smaller than copper of the same nominal size due to thicker walls, which affects flow calculations.

| PEX Size (OD) | Approximate Internal Diameter | Equivalent Copper Size |
|---|---|---|
| 16 mm PEX | ~11.6 mm | Slightly less flow than 15 mm copper |
| 20 mm PEX | ~14.4 mm | Slightly less flow than 20 mm copper |
| 25 mm PEX | ~18.0 mm | Less flow than 25 mm copper |
| 32 mm PEX | ~23.2 mm | Less flow than 32 mm copper |

**Scope impact:** When replacing copper with PEX, the plumber may need to upsize in some situations to maintain equivalent flow rates. This is particularly relevant for long runs and multi-fixture supply lines.

### 4.5 Temperature and Pressure Ratings

| Condition | PN16 Rating | PN20 Rating (Hot Water) |
|---|---|---|
| 20 degrees C (cold water) | 1,600 kPa (16 bar) | 2,000 kPa (20 bar) |
| 60 degrees C | ~800 kPa | ~1,000 kPa |
| 70 degrees C | ~600 kPa | ~800 kPa |
| 80 degrees C | ~400 kPa | ~600 kPa |
| 95 degrees C (maximum intermittent) | ~200 kPa | ~350 kPa |

**Key points:**
- PEX is rated for continuous use up to **70 degrees C** (which exceeds the AS/NZS 3500 maximum delivery temperature of 50 degrees C at fixtures)
- PEX can handle intermittent temperatures up to **95 degrees C** (e.g., tempering valve failure scenarios)
- Pressure rating decreases as temperature increases — this is normal and accounted for in system design
- PN20 rated pipe (SDR 7.4) exceeds AS/NZS 3500 requirements for hot water and should always be used for hot water supply lines

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 2492, manufacturer specifications)

### 4.6 Connection Methods

#### 4.6.1 Crimp System (Auspex Style)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Insert brass fitting into pipe end, place copper crimp ring over joint, compress with crimp tool |
| **Ring material** | Copper (16mm, 20mm, 25mm) or stainless steel (32mm) |
| **Tool** | Battery-powered or manual crimp tool with size-specific jaws |
| **Speed** | Very fast — 2-3 seconds per connection |
| **Reliability** | Excellent — consistent, repeatable connection |
| **Inspection** | Visual — ring must be fully compressed, no gaps |
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 2537 |
| **Brands** | Auspex (primary crimp system in AU market) |
| **Advantages** | Fast, consistent, lower fitting cost than expansion, widely available |
| **Disadvantages** | Connection is permanent — pipe cannot be repositioned after crimping |

#### 4.6.2 Expansion / Compression Sleeve System (Rehau Style)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Expand pipe end with expansion tool (2 expansions, rotating 30 degrees between), insert fitting, slide stainless steel compression sleeve over joint using sliding tool |
| **Sleeve material** | Stainless steel |
| **Tool** | Battery-powered RAUTOOL expansion head + sliding tool |
| **Speed** | Fast — slightly slower than crimp due to expansion steps |
| **Reliability** | Excellent — PEX-A memory "shrinks" around fitting for extremely strong seal |
| **Inspection** | Visual — sleeve must be fully advanced to fitting collar |
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 2537 |
| **Brands** | Rehau RAUTITAN (primary expansion system in AU market) |
| **Advantages** | Strongest possible connection (uses PEX-A shape memory), fitting can be repositioned before sleeve is slid (beneficial for alignment), reversible sleeve |
| **Disadvantages** | Requires specific RAUTOOL (not universal), higher fitting cost, requires PEX-A pipe |

#### 4.6.3 Push-Fit (SharkBite / EvoPEX)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Push pipe into fitting until it locks — no tools required |
| **Compatible** | PEX, copper, CPVC, PE-RT in any combination |
| **Speed** | Fastest — 1-2 seconds per connection |
| **Reliability** | Good — O-ring seal with stainless steel grab ring |
| **Inspection** | Visual — check depth mark on pipe aligns with fitting edge |
| **Standards** | WaterMark certified, NCC 2022 Vol. 3 compliant |
| **Brands** | SharkBite, EvoPEX |
| **Advantages** | No tools, fastest possible connection, excellent for transitions between pipe materials |
| **Disadvantages** | Most expensive fittings, O-ring may degrade long-term, some plumber reluctance for concealed use |

### 4.7 Advantages of PEX in Renovation Context

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Flexibility** | Routes through existing walls, floors, ceiling cavities without needing fittings at every turn |
| **Speed** | Installation up to 3x faster than copper |
| **Cost** | Material cost 3-5x cheaper than copper per metre |
| **No flame** | All connection methods are flameless — critical for renovation safety |
| **Corrosion-free** | No pinhole leaks, no electrolysis, no green staining |
| **Noise reduction** | Naturally dampens water hammer and flow noise |
| **Freeze resistance** | PEX expands to accommodate ice formation (relevant for alpine areas) |
| **Chemical resistance** | Resistant to most plumbing chemicals and water treatments |
| **Continuous lengths** | Available in coils up to 50m — fewer joints means fewer potential leak points |
| **Lightweight** | Easy to handle and transport on renovation sites |

### 4.8 Disadvantages of PEX in Renovation Context

| Disadvantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| **UV sensitivity** | Degrades rapidly in direct sunlight — **must not be exposed to UV**. Maximum UV exposure before installation varies by manufacturer (typically 30-90 days with UV shield) |
| **Rodent damage** | Rodents can chew through PEX — requires protection in accessible roof spaces and sub-floor areas |
| **Chlorine/chloramine degradation** | Chlorine and chloramine in treated water gradually deplete antioxidants in the PEX material. Hot water lines are most affected (heat accelerates degradation). This is a long-term concern (decades) but should be noted |
| **Smaller bore** | Internal diameter is smaller than same-nominal copper — may need upsizing for equivalent flow |
| **Not suitable for external exposed** | Cannot be used for exposed outdoor pipe runs (UV and temperature cycling) |
| **Perception** | Some homeowners (especially in premium market) perceive PEX as "cheaper" than copper |
| **Fitting restriction** | PEX fittings reduce bore at connection points — more significant flow restriction than copper solder joints |
| **Brand lock-in** | Most PEX systems use proprietary fittings — cannot mix Auspex fittings with Rehau pipe (cross-brand adaptors exist but add cost) |

### 4.9 When to Use PEX

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Full re-pipe of water supply | **Preferred** — fastest, most cost-effective |
| New wet area (kitchen, bathroom, laundry) | **Preferred** — standard choice |
| Concealed pipe runs behind walls/in floors | **Preferred** — flexibility makes routing easy |
| Budget renovation | **Preferred** — significant cost savings |
| Any renovation in timber-framed home | **Preferred** — no fire risk from flame connections |
| Heritage property (heritage overlay) | **Check** — heritage requirements may mandate copper |
| Exposed outdoor runs | **Avoid** — UV degradation |
| Accessible roof spaces with rodent activity | **Caution** — protect with conduit or use copper |
| High-temperature industrial applications | **Avoid** — PEX is rated for residential hot water only |

### 4.10 Cost Comparison (Relative)

| Item | Approximate Cost Range | Rating |
|---|---|---|
| 16mm PEX pipe (per metre — coil) | $2.50-$4.50 | Budget |
| 20mm PEX pipe (per metre — coil) | $3.50-$6.00 | Budget |
| 25mm PEX pipe (per metre — coil) | $5.50-$9.00 | Budget-Mid |
| 32mm PEX pipe (per metre — coil) | $8.00-$14.00 | Mid-range |
| Crimp elbow (16mm) | $3.00-$5.00 | Budget |

## 5. Multilayer Pipe (PEX-AL-PEX)

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 4176 referenced, manufacturer data)

### 5.1 Overview

Multilayer pipe (also called composite pipe or PEX-AL-PEX) consists of three layers:

1. **Inner layer** — Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) — smooth bore for water flow
2. **Middle layer** — Aluminium (AL) — provides shape retention, oxygen barrier, and pressure strength
3. **Outer layer** — Polyethylene (PE or PEX) — protects aluminium from external damage

The aluminium layer gives multilayer pipe a unique combination of PEX flexibility with copper-like shape retention — it can be bent by hand and **holds its shape** without springing back.

### 5.2 Australian Standard — AS/NZS 4176:2004

AS/NZS 4176 specifies requirements for multilayer piping systems. Products must be WaterMark certified and meet AS/NZS 4020 for drinking water contact.

**Temperature limitations (from AS/NZS 5601.1 Table 4.1 for gas applications):**

| Pipe Construction | Maximum Temperature |
|---|---|
| PEX/AL/PEX (both layers cross-linked) | 80 degrees C |
| HDPE/AL/PEX or PEX/AL/HDPE (any non-cross-linked layer) | 60 degrees C |

### 5.3 When Multilayer Is Preferred Over PEX

| Scenario | Why Multilayer Is Better |
|---|---|
| **Exposed pipe runs** | Holds shape — no sagging, neater appearance, can be clipped at wider intervals |
| **Gas installations** | AS/NZS 4176-compliant multilayer is approved for internal gas (to 70 kPa max pressure) |
| **Hydronic heating** | Shape retention + oxygen barrier (aluminium layer) prevents oxygen ingress that causes boiler/radiator corrosion |
| **Tight spaces requiring precise bends** | Bends by hand and holds position — no need for bend supports or fittings at every turn |
| **Pipe runs requiring appearance** | Neater than PEX (which wants to coil) when exposed or semi-exposed |
| **Where oxygen barrier is needed** | Aluminium layer provides complete oxygen barrier — important for closed-loop heating systems |

### 5.4 Multilayer Pipe Sizes — Residential

| Size (OD x Wall) | Internal Bore | Common Application |
|---|---|---|
| 16 x 2.0 mm | 12.0 mm | Individual fixture supply, hydronic heating loops |
| 20 x 2.0 mm | 16.0 mm | Branch lines, shower/bath supply, gas |
| 25 x 2.5 mm | 20.0 mm | Main supply lines, larger gas runs |
| 32 x 3.0 mm | 26.0 mm | Sub-main supply, commercial crossover |

### 5.5 Connection Methods

#### 5.5.1 Compression Sleeve (Rehau RAUTITAN PEX-AL-PE)

Same system as PEX-A expansion sleeve — the Rehau RAUTITAN range includes multilayer pipe that uses the same compression sleeve fitting system and RAUTOOL.

#### 5.5.2 Press-Fit

Some multilayer systems use press-fit connections similar to copper press-fit — a hydraulic press tool compresses a sleeve or ring onto the fitting.

#### 5.5.3 Compression (Mechanical)

Brass compression fittings are available for multilayer pipe — similar to copper compression fittings but sized for multilayer OD dimensions.

### 5.6 Advantages

| Advantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| Shape retention | Bends by hand, holds shape — reduces need for clips and supports |
| Oxygen barrier | Aluminium layer prevents oxygen ingress — essential for closed heating systems |
| Versatility | Approved for water supply, gas (to 70 kPa), and hydronic heating |
| Lower thermal expansion | Aluminium layer significantly reduces thermal expansion compared to PEX alone |
| Kink resistance | More kink-resistant than PEX-B due to aluminium reinforcement |
| Neat appearance | Excellent for exposed or semi-exposed installations |

### 5.7 Disadvantages

| Disadvantage | Detail |
|---|---|
| Higher cost | More expensive than PEX per metre (aluminium layer adds cost) |
| Fatigue failure risk | Repeated bending at the same point can cause aluminium layer to fatigue and crack |
| Delamination | In poor-quality products, the aluminium layer can delaminate from the PEX layers |
| Fewer fittings available | Narrower range of fittings compared to PEX or copper |
| Slightly larger OD | For same bore, multilayer has larger OD than PEX due to aluminium layer thickness |

## 6. PVC / uPVC (Drainage, Waste & Vent)

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 1260 and AS/NZS 1477 referenced directly)

### 6.1 Overview

PVC-U (unplasticised polyvinyl chloride, also written as uPVC) is the **standard pipe material for drainage, waste, and vent (DWV) systems** in Australian residential buildings. PVC is **NOT used for hot or cold water supply** in standard residential plumbing (unlike in some overseas markets).

PVC in Australian residential plumbing falls into three distinct categories:

1. **DWV** (Drain, Waste, Vent) — Non-pressure, gravity-flow drainage
2. **Stormwater** — Non-pressure, gravity-flow rainwater/surface water drainage
3. **Pressure** — For water supply mains (typically utility connection to meter only, not within building)

### 6.2 Applicable Standards

| Standard | Application |
|---|---|
| **AS/NZS 1260:2017** | PVC-U pipes and fittings for DWV applications |
| **AS/NZS 1254:2010** | PVC-U pipes and fittings for stormwater and surface water applications |
| **AS/NZS 1477:2017** | PVC pipes and fittings for pressure applications |
| **AS/NZS 2032:2006** | Installation of PVC pipe systems |
| **AS/NZS 3500.2:2021** | Sanitary plumbing and drainage (governs installation) |
| **AS/NZS 3500.3:2021** | Stormwater drainage (governs installation) |

### 6.3 PVC Colour Coding — Australian Convention

| Colour | Application | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| **Light grey** (Pearl Grey N11 or Cloud Grey N22 per AS 2700) | DWV — Drain, Waste, Vent (sanitary drainage) | AS/NZS 1260 |
| **Cream / off-white** | Pressure sewer | Various |
| **White** (Series 1) or **Light blue** (Series 2) | PVC pressure pipe (drinking water mains) | AS/NZS 1477 |
| **Dark grey / no specific colour** | Stormwater (no mandatory colour in AS/NZS 1254) | AS/NZS 1254 |
| **Purple** | Recycled water | Various |
| **Orange** | Underground electrical conduit (not plumbing) | AS/NZS 2053 |

**Important:** DWV pipe (grey) must **NOT** be used for pressure applications. Stormwater pipe must **NOT** be used for sanitary drainage (different specifications and fittings).

### 6.4 Stiffness Ratings (SN Classification)

For DWV pipes of DN100 and larger, pipes are classified by stiffness number (SN) which measures resistance to external pressure and lateral deflection:

| SN Rating | Ring Stiffness | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **SN4** | 4 kN/m2 | Standard domestic plumbing, shallow burial (<600mm cover), slab-on-ground |
| **SN6** | 6 kN/m2 | Domestic and light commercial, moderate burial depths |
| **SN8** | 8 kN/m2 | Municipal drainage, deeper burial, traffic-loaded areas |
| **SN10** | 10 kN/m2 | Heavy municipal drainage, deep burial, under roads |

**For residential renovations:** SN4 is standard for above-ground DWV and slab-on-ground drainage. SN6 is used for below-ground drainage outside the building footprint. SN8 and SN10 are not typically required for residential work.

**For pipes smaller than DN100:** Classification is by minimum wall thickness rather than SN rating.

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 1260 specifications)

### 6.5 DWV Pipe Sizes — Residential Applications

| Nominal Size (DN) | Outside Diameter (mm) | Wall Thickness SN4 (mm) | Common Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DN40** | 42.0 | 2.0 (min wall) | Basin waste, laundry tub waste, dishwasher waste |
| **DN50** | 55.5 | 2.0 (min wall) | Kitchen sink waste, shower waste (some states), bath waste |
| **DN65** | 68.5 | 2.3 (min wall) | Combined basin/bath waste, laundry floor waste connections |
| **DN80** | 84.0 | 2.7 (min wall) | Shower floor waste gully connections, combined wastes |
| **DN100** | 109.5 | 2.7 (SN4) | **Toilet/WC connection**, building drain, sewer connection — the "hundred mil" pipe |
| **DN150** | 163.0 | 4.0 (SN4) | Building sewer drain (from junction to property boundary), combined drainage |

**Key sizing rules (AS/NZS 3500.2):**

| Fixture | Minimum Trap Size | Minimum Waste Pipe Size |
|---|---|---|
| Basin (hand wash) | 32mm | DN40 |
| Kitchen sink | 40mm | DN40 (minimum) — DN50 (recommended and common practice) |
| Shower | 40mm (50mm grate) | DN40 to floor waste gully |
| Bath | 40mm | DN40 |
| Laundry tub | 40mm | DN40 |
| Washing machine | 40mm | DN40 |
| Toilet (WC) | N/A (integral trap) | **DN100** (mandatory — no exceptions) |
| Floor waste gully | 50mm minimum | DN50-DN100 depending on connected fixtures |
| Building drain | N/A | **DN100** minimum |
| Building sewer | N/A | **DN100** minimum (DN150 common) |

**Scope impact:** Toilet drainage is always DN100. Kitchen and bathroom waste is typically DN40-DN50. The building drain and sewer connection are always minimum DN100.

### 6.6 Connection Methods — DWV PVC

#### 6.6.1 Solvent Cement Jointing (SCJ)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Clean surfaces, apply primer (for some brands), apply solvent cement to pipe and fitting socket, insert and twist 1/4 turn, hold for 30 seconds |
| **Joint type** | Permanent — chemically fused (solvent welds the PVC surfaces together) |
| **Products** | PVC solvent cement (blue can) and primer (clear or purple) |
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 2032 |
| **Set time** | Initial set: 30-60 seconds. Full cure: 24 hours (before pressure testing) |
| **Best for** | All above-ground DWV installations, below-ground pipes up to ~DN100 |
| **Considerations** | Cannot be undone — mistakes require cutting and replacing. Ensure correct alignment before solvent sets |

#### 6.6.2 Rubber Ring Joint (RRJ)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Method** | Lubricant applied to rubber ring in socket, spigot end pushed into socket — rubber ring creates seal |
| **Joint type** | Flexible — allows minor angular deflection and axial movement |
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 1260, AS/NZS 2032 |
| **Best for** | Below-ground drainage, longer runs where ground movement is expected, DN100 and larger |
| **Considerations** | Not as rigid as SCJ — pipe must be bedded properly to prevent movement |

### 6.7 When to Use / When NOT to Use PVC

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Sanitary drainage (toilet, basin, shower, bath waste) | **Standard choice** — PVC DWV to AS/NZS 1260 |
| Vent pipes | **Standard choice** — same PVC DWV material |
| Stormwater drainage | **Standard choice** — PVC stormwater to AS/NZS 1254 |
| Below-ground building sewer | **Standard choice** — SN4 or SN6 depending on depth |
| Hot or cold water supply | **NEVER** — PVC-U is not approved for pressure water supply within buildings in Australia |
| Gas installation | **NEVER** — PVC is not approved for gas |
| Above ground in direct sunlight (long-term) | **Avoid** — PVC degrades with prolonged UV exposure (paint or sleeve if unavoidable) |
| High-temperature discharge (>60 degrees C sustained) | **Caution** — PVC softens at high temperatures. Tempering or mixing required before discharge |

## 7. HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 4130 referenced)

### 7.1 Overview

HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pipe is a tough, flexible, corrosion-resistant pipe used primarily for **underground water supply mains** and **gas distribution** in Australia. In residential renovations, HDPE is most commonly encountered as:

- The water supply main from the water meter to the building
- Underground gas pipe (yellow-stripe PE — covered in Section 8)
- Stormwater and drainage in some newer installations

HDPE is **less commonly used inside buildings** for residential water supply (PEX and copper are preferred for internal reticulation). However, PE pipe is standard for the external supply connection.

### 7.2 Australian Standard — AS/NZS 4130:2018

AS/NZS 4130 specifies requirements for polyethylene pipes for pressure applications. The standard covers PE80 and PE100 grades.

| Grade | Minimum Required Strength (MRS) | Typical Application |
|---|---|---|
| **PE80** | 8 MPa | Older installations, lower-pressure applications |
| **PE100** | 10 MPa | Current standard — higher pressure rating, longer design life |

**Design life:** PE100 pipe is designed for a service life of **100+ years** under normal operating conditions.

### 7.3 HDPE Sizes — Residential Applications

| Size (OD) | SDR | Pressure Rating | Common Application |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 mm | SDR 11 | PN16 | Individual dwelling water service connection |
| 25 mm | SDR 11 | PN16 | Standard residential water service (meter to building) |
| 32 mm | SDR 11 | PN16 | Larger residential, dual-occupancy |
| 40 mm | SDR 11 | PN16 | Multi-unit residential |
| 50 mm | SDR 11 | PN16 | Multi-unit, commercial crossover |
| 63 mm | SDR 11 | PN16 | Larger multi-unit residential |

## 8. Gas Piping

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 5601.1:2022 referenced)

### 8.1 Overview

Gas piping in Australian residential buildings is governed by **AS/NZS 5601.1:2022** (General Gas Installations). Gas work must be performed by a licensed gasfitter (in most states, this is a separate licence from general plumbing, although many plumbers hold both).

The choice of gas piping material depends on:
- Whether the installation is **internal** (inside the building) or **external** (underground)
- The type of gas (natural gas or LPG)
- The operating pressure (low, medium, or high pressure)
- State-specific requirements

### 8.2 Approved Gas Piping Materials

| Material | Internal Use | External/Underground | Standard | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Copper** | YES — standard for internal gas | YES (with protection) | AS 1432 | Traditional material for internal gas reticulation |
| **Multilayer (PEX-AL-PEX)** | YES (with conditions) | YES (buried) | AS/NZS 4176 | Must be yellow with black lettering or black with yellow lettering. Must terminate min 1m from appliance |
| **Composite (GasPex)** | YES (with conditions) | YES (buried) | AS/NZS 4176 | Similar to multilayer — specific gas-rated products required |
| **Polyethylene (PE)** | **NO** — not for internal use | YES — standard for underground external gas | AS/NZS 4130 | Yellow-stripe PE. Must transition to copper or multilayer before entering building |
| **Stainless steel (CSST)** | YES (with conditions) | LIMITED | Various | Corrugated stainless steel tubing — available but less common in AU |
| **PVC** | **NO** | **NO** | N/A | PVC is NEVER approved for gas |
| **PEX (plain — no aluminium layer)** | **NO** for most applications | **NO** | N/A | Standard PEX without aluminium barrier is generally not approved for gas. Some gas-rated PEX products exist (e.g., Auspex Gas) — check specific product approvals |

### 8.3 Copper for Gas

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Standard** | AS 1432 Type B copper tube |
| **Sizes** | 15mm (single appliance), 20mm (multiple appliances/longer runs), 25mm (larger installations) |
| **Connection** | Silver brazed (NOT soft soldered — gas joints must be brazed with BCuP series filler metals, minimum 5% silver content) |
| **Testing** | Air pressure test at 7 kPa for 10 minutes (standard residential) with no pressure drop. Higher pressures for medium/high pressure systems |
| **Location** | Must be accessible for inspection. Cannot be buried in concrete without protection |
| **Internal standard** | Copper is the default internal gas piping material in most Australian states |
| **Key requirement** | Minimum 6 metres of copper from the gas meter outlet is commonly required before any transition to composite pipe (state-specific — check local requirements) |

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 5601.1 direct requirements)

### 8.4 Polyethylene (PE) for Gas — External/Underground

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Material** | PE80 or PE100, SDR 11 or SDR 17 |
| **Colour** | Yellow-stripe (yellow identification stripe on black pipe) or fully yellow |
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 4130 for pipe, AS/NZS 4129 for fittings |
| **Connection** | Electrofusion (preferred), compression fittings (for smaller sizes) |
| **Burial depth** | Minimum 300mm cover in residential (500mm under driveways/traffic) |
| **Transition** | Must transition to approved internal material (copper or multilayer) at building entry point — typically using a PE-to-copper or PE-to-multilayer transition fitting |
| **Marking** | Pipe must be permanently marked with: AS 4130 / manufacturer / GAS / pipe size / SDR |
| **Advantages** | Cost-effective for long underground runs, flexible (accommodates ground movement and earthquakes), corrosion-free, long coils reduce joints |
| **Key restriction** | **Cannot be used inside buildings** — must terminate outside the building envelope |

### 8.5 Multilayer/Composite for Gas

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Products** | GasPex, EziPEX Gas, Auspex DuoPEX Gas, Rehau RAUTITAN Gas |
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 4176 |

| **Maximum pressure** | 70 kPa for both natural gas and LPG (AS/NZS 5601.1 Table 4.1) |
| **Maximum temperature** | 80 degrees C for PEX/AL/PEX; 60 degrees C if any layer is non-cross-linked PE |
| **Termination** | Must terminate at least **1 metre** from the nearest part of any gas appliance (to prevent heat damage) |
| **Transition requirement** | Some jurisdictions require minimum 6 metres of copper from meter before composite pipe begins. Some require composite to transition to copper for the final connection to each appliance. Check local authority requirements |
| **Connection** | Crimp or compression sleeve (brand-specific — same as water PEX fittings but gas-rated) |
| **Advantages** | Faster installation than copper, flameless connections, flexible, cost-effective for long runs |
| **Disadvantages** | More fittings restrictions, termination distance requirements, state-specific rules vary |

### 8.6 Gas Pipe Sizing — Residential

Gas pipe sizing is based on:
1. Total gas load (MJ/h) of all connected appliances
2. Pipe length (longest run from meter to furthest appliance)
3. Allowable pressure drop (typically 0.75 kPa for natural gas residential)
4. Pipe material (copper, PE, and multilayer have different flow characteristics)

**Common residential gas appliance loads (natural gas):**

| Appliance | Typical Gas Load (MJ/h) |
|---|---|
| Gas cooktop (4 burner) | 30-40 |
| Gas oven | 10-15 |
| Gas hot water system (instantaneous/continuous flow) | 120-200 |
| Gas hot water system (storage) | 40-80 |
| Gas ducted heating | 40-80 |
| Gas space heater (flued) | 15-30 |
| Gas bayonet (portable heater) | 15-25 |
| Gas BBQ outlet | 15-20 |

**Typical pipe sizing for copper (natural gas at 2.75 kPa delivery pressure):**

| Pipe Length (m) | 15mm Copper Max Load (MJ/h) | 20mm Copper Max Load (MJ/h) | 25mm Copper Max Load (MJ/h) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | ~80 | ~190 | ~420 |
| 10 | ~55 | ~130 | ~290 |
| 15 | ~45 | ~105 | ~230 |
| 20 | ~38 | ~90 | ~200 |
| 30 | ~30 | ~72 | ~160 |

**Note:** These are approximate values only — actual sizing must be calculated by the licensed gasfitter using AS/NZS 5601.1 Appendix F tables or manufacturer-specific flow charts.

**Scope impact:** Scope documents should NOT specify gas pipe sizes — this is the gasfitter's responsibility based on load calculations. Scopes should specify the number and type of gas points required and leave sizing to the tradesperson.

### 8.7 Gas Testing Requirements

| Test | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Standing pressure test** | All new gas installations must be pressure tested before commissioning |
| **Test medium** | Air or inert gas (nitrogen) — **NEVER** test with gas |
| **Low pressure residential** | 7 kPa for 10 minutes with no pressure drop |
| **Medium pressure** | Higher test pressures per AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Instrument** | Calibrated pressure gauge or manometer |
| **Compliance** | Test results recorded on Certificate of Compliance/Gas work notice |

### 8.8 Cost Comparison (Relative — Gas Piping)

| Item | Approximate Cost Range | Rating |
|---|---|---|
| 15mm copper gas pipe (per metre) | $6.00-$10.00 | Mid-range |
| 20mm copper gas pipe (per metre) | $9.00-$14.00 | Mid-range to Premium |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (industry knowledge — limited standard references for obsolete materials)

### 9.1 Overview

When renovating older Australian homes, plumbers frequently encounter legacy pipe materials that are no longer installed in new work. Understanding these materials is important for:
- Identifying what needs to be replaced
- Understanding limitations of existing systems
- Planning transition points between old and new materials
- Estimating scope of replacement work

### 9.2 Galvanised Steel

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Era** | Common in Australian homes built 1940s-1970s |
| **Application** | Hot and cold water supply, sometimes drainage |
| **Lifespan** | 40-60 years (zinc coating erodes, then steel corrodes from inside) |
| **Common issues** | Internal corrosion and scale buildup (restricts flow), rusty/discoloured water, reduced water pressure, pinhole leaks at threaded joints |
| **Renovation action** | **Replace entirely** — partial replacement creates galvanic corrosion at copper/galvanised junctions. Replace with PEX or copper |
| **Scope consideration** | Budget for full re-pipe when galvanised is encountered. Partial replacement is false economy |
| **Electrical grounding** | Older homes may use galvanised water pipes for electrical grounding — electrician must install alternative earthing before plumber removes metal pipes |

### 9.3 Cast Iron

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Era** | Common in Australian homes built pre-1970s for drainage |
| **Application** | Sanitary drainage, sewer lines, vent stacks |
| **Lifespan** | 50-100 years |
| **Common issues** | Brittleness with age, root intrusion at joints, internal corrosion and blockages, heavy and difficult to support |
| **Renovation action** | Replace with PVC DWV when accessible. Transition fittings available (Fernco rubber couplings) for connecting PVC to existing cast iron where full replacement is not practical |
| **Scope consideration** | Cast iron removal is heavy, dirty work — budget for additional demolition and disposal |

### 9.4 Lead Pipe

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Era** | Pre-1930s Australian homes — very old properties only |
| **Application** | Water supply (primarily service connection from main to building) |
| **Lifespan** | 100+ years (lead is very durable) |
| **Common issues** | **Lead poisoning risk** — lead leaches into drinking water, especially with soft/acidic water |
| **Renovation action** | **Must be replaced** — any lead water supply pipe discovered during renovation should be reported to the water authority and replaced immediately |
| **Scope consideration** | Lead pipe replacement may involve the water authority for the section from main to meter. Homeowner is responsible for meter to building |

### 9.5 Earthenware (Vitrified Clay)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Era** | Pre-1970s Australian homes — drainage and sewer |
| **Application** | Below-ground sanitary drainage and sewer |
| **Lifespan** | 50-80 years |
| **Common issues** | Brittle, susceptible to root intrusion at mortar joints, joint displacement from ground movement |
| **Renovation action** | Replace with PVC when exposed during renovation. CCTV inspection recommended for below-ground sections before deciding scope of replacement |
| **Scope consideration** | Earthenware replacement involves excavation — significant cost if pipe is under established landscaping or structures |

### 9.6 Polybutylene (PB)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Era** | 1980s-1990s — installed as a cheaper alternative to copper |
| **Application** | Hot and cold water supply |
| **Lifespan** | 10-25 years (known failure material) |
| **Common issues** | Premature failure due to chlorine degradation — micro-fractures develop at fittings and in pipe walls. Subject to class action lawsuits in multiple countries |
| **Renovation action** | **Replace entirely with PEX or copper** — polybutylene should never be retained or extended |
| **Scope consideration** | If polybutylene is identified during renovation, full re-pipe should be recommended regardless of original scope |

## 10. Pipe Sizing Quick Reference — Residential Applications

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 3500 requirements)

### 10.1 Water Supply Pipe Sizing

| Application | Minimum Size (Copper) | Minimum Size (PEX) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Water meter to building (external) | 20mm (typically PE) | 20mm PE | Size determined by water authority — typically 20mm or 25mm |
| Main cold water supply (internal) | 20mm | 25mm (PEX has smaller bore) | Size up PEX to compensate for bore reduction |
| Hot water supply from HWS | 20mm | 20-25mm | Depends on number of fixtures served |
| Branch to kitchen | 15mm | 16mm | Both hot and cold |
| Branch to bathroom (single fixture) | 15mm | 16mm | Basin, toilet cistern |
| Branch to shower | 15mm | 20mm | Higher flow demand |
| Branch to bath | 15mm | 20mm | Higher flow demand for faster fill |
| Hose cock / garden tap | 15-20mm | 16-20mm | 20mm preferred for hose flow |

**Key principles:**
- Maximum velocity permitted by AS/NZS 3500.1 is **3 m/s**, but best practice is **2.2 m/s or less**
- Minimum pressure at any outlet must be **5 metres head** (50 kPa) per AS/NZS 3500.1
- Pipe sizing is based on **probable simultaneous flow** — not all fixtures operate at once
- Each fixture is assigned **loading units (LU)** per AS/NZS 3500.1 tables

### 10.2 Drainage Pipe Sizing

| Application | Minimum Size | Pipe Material | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hand basin waste | DN40 | PVC DWV | 32mm trap, DN40 pipe |
| Kitchen sink waste | DN40 (DN50 preferred) | PVC DWV | DN50 is best practice — grease and food particles require larger bore |
| Shower waste | DN40 | PVC DWV | Connected to floor waste gully (minimum DN80 grate) |
| Bath waste | DN40 | PVC DWV | 40mm trap |
| Laundry tub waste | DN40 | PVC DWV | 40mm trap |
| Washing machine waste | DN40 | PVC DWV | Must discharge to floor waste gully or dedicated standpipe |
| Floor waste gully (bathroom) | DN50-DN80 | PVC DWV | Size depends on connected fixtures |
| Toilet (WC) | **DN100** | PVC DWV | **Always DN100 — mandatory, no exceptions** |
| Building drain (horizontal) | **DN100** minimum | PVC DWV | Minimum grade: 1:60 for DN100 |
| Building sewer (to boundary) | **DN100** minimum | PVC DWV SN6+ | DN150 common for shared sewer runs |
| Vent pipe (individual) | DN40 minimum | PVC DWV | Same material as DWV |
| Vent stack | DN65-DN100 | PVC DWV | Size depends on drainage load |

### 10.3 Gas Pipe Sizing

Refer to Section 8.6 — Gas pipe sizing must be calculated by the licensed gasfitter based on total gas load and pipe run length. Do not specify gas pipe sizes in scope documents.
