# 9.1 How Plumbing Items Are Described in Professional Scopes

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on analysis of Australian plumbing company quote formats, HIA contract templates, and industry practice)

## General Conventions

Plumbing scope items in Australian residential renovations follow a consistent pattern that mirrors other trades but includes plumbing-specific conventions:

**Standard Structure:**
`[Action verb] + [Quantity] + [Item description] + [Specification/Type] + [Location] + [Connection details] + [Notes/qualifiers]`

The action verb is critical because it defines **who is responsible for what**:

| Action Verb | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Supply and install** (S&I) | Plumber provides the item AND installs it — includes materials and labour |
| **Install only** | Owner (or another party) supplies the item; plumber installs it — labour only |
| **Rough-in** | First fix work: run pipework (water supply, waste, gas) to the fixture location, ready for connection after linings/tiling |
| **Fit-off** | Second fix work: connect the fixture to the pre-installed pipework after tiling/linings are complete |
| **Rough-in and fit-off** | Both stages included — covers the full plumbing scope for that fixture |
| **Disconnect and remove** | Remove existing fixture, cap/plug existing services |
| **Disconnect, remove, and dispose** | As above plus remove from site |
| **Cap off** | Seal an unused pipe end permanently |
| **Relocate** | Move an existing service point to a new position — implies both disconnection from old and connection at new |
| **Connect** | Join to existing services (implies pipework is already in position) |
| **Test and commission** | Pressure test, leak check, and verify operation |
| **Make good** | Repair/restore surfaces after plumbing work (patching, sealing) — note: plumbers typically exclude plaster/tile make-good |

## How Specifications Are Referenced

In plumbing scopes for residential renovations, specifications are referenced at a practical level — not the full engineering specification you would see on a commercial project:

- **Pipe material:** "copper", "PEX", "PVC", "HDPE" — stated when it matters (e.g., "re-pipe in PEX" or "copper to hot water system")
- **Pipe size:** DN (nominal diameter) — e.g., DN15, DN20, DN25 for water supply; DN40, DN50, DN65, DN80, DN100 for waste/drainage
- **Fixture brands:** Referenced when owner has selected a specific product, or as "or equivalent"
- **Standards:** Referenced as "per AS/NZS 3500" or "compliant with Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA)"
- **Valve types:** TMV, tempering valve, backflow prevention device, isolation valve, pressure limiting valve (PLV) — stated by function
- **Connection type:** "to existing" vs "new run from meter/main" — critical cost distinction

## Plumbing-Specific Language Conventions

Plumbing scopes use some conventions that differ from other trades:

1. **"Services" not "utilities"** — In Australian plumbing, the water supply, waste, gas, and stormwater are collectively called "services"
2. **"Points" as a unit of measure** — Plumbers often quote "per point" where a point equals one fixture connection (e.g., "one hot water point, one cold water point, one waste point" for a basin = 3 points)
3. **"Set-out" not "layout"** — The positioning of rough-in pipework to match fixture locations is called the "set-out"
4. **"Centres" for measurement** — Tap positions are described as "centres" (the distance between hot and cold water inlets)
5. **"Stack" for vertical drainage** — The main vertical drainage pipe is the "stack" or "soil stack"
6. **"Fall" or "grade"** — The slope on drainage pipes (minimum 1:60 for horizontal runs per AS/NZS 3500.2)
7. **"Wet area" designation** — Bathrooms, laundries, and ensuites are "wet areas" with specific plumbing and waterproofing requirements
8. **"Like-for-like"** — Replacing a fixture in the same position with the same type of fixture, reusing existing pipework where possible

# 9.3 Level of Specification — The Sweet Spot

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on industry best practice analysis and plumber feedback from Australian forums and trade websites)

## The Goldilocks Principle for Plumbing Scopes

The scope needs to be detailed enough for a plumber to provide an accurate, comparable quote — but not so prescriptive that it constrains their professional judgement or locks in products that may be unavailable.

### Too Vague (Bad)

```
- New plumbing for the bathroom
- Replace kitchen sink
- Fix the hot water
- New taps throughout
- General plumbing for renovation
```

**Problem:** "New plumbing for the bathroom" could mean anything from connecting a new basin ($300) to a complete strip-out and re-pipe ($5,000-$10,000). The plumber will quote the minimum interpretation, and everything else becomes a variation. Disputes are inevitable.

### Too Prescriptive (Also Bad)

```
- Supply and install 1x Caroma Luna 1675mm freestanding acrylic bath
  in gloss white (product code GES7845W), positioned with centreline
  at exactly 1,250mm from north wall, with Caroma Luna floor-mounted
  bath mixer in chrome (product code 98230C6A), waste connected using
  DN40 Schedule 40 PVC pipe with 50mm seal depth P-trap (McAlpine
  SM10), falling at exactly 1:40 to the floor waste gully (Allproof
  Boss Gully DN80), with isolation valves (Tomson TE-20B-1520 15mm
  ball valve) at both hot and cold supply lines, hot water supplied
  via 15mm Type B copper pipe to AS 1432, brazed joints using
  Harris Stay-Silv 15% silver brazing alloy...
```

**Problem:** Over-specification creates several issues:
- Locks you into specific products that may be out of stock, discontinued, or not stocked by the plumber's regular supplier
- Adds cost — the plumber can't use their preferred (and potentially cheaper) equivalent materials
- Makes quoting harder — the plumber must price-check every specified item
- Doesn't leave room for the plumber's professional judgement on best practice
- A homeowner writing this level of detail will likely make technical errors that confuse the plumber

### Just Right (Good)

```
- Rough-in and fit-off 1x freestanding bath (owner to supply,
  approx 1675mm). Include floor-mounted bath mixer rough-in,
  bath waste with overflow, and 2x isolation valves. Position
  per bathroom plan.

- Supply and install 1x wall-mounted shower mixer with overhead
  rain shower head and hand-held shower on rail. Chrome finish.
  Allow PC sum of $600 for owner-selected tapware set. Include
  rough-in to mixer location per plan, DN50 shower waste
  connected to floor waste gully, and hot/cold water supply.

- Disconnect and remove existing vanity, basin, and tapware.
  Cap off services. Dispose of old fixtures off-site.
```

**Why this works:**
- Specifies fixture type and approximate size (1675mm bath)
- Clarifies who supplies what (owner supply vs plumber supply)
- Includes all required connections (mixer, waste, overflow, isolation valves)
- References a plan for positioning
- Uses PC sum for owner-selected items
- Includes both stages (rough-in and fit-off)
- Leaves pipe material, specific fittings, and routing to the plumber's professional judgement
- Is specific enough to generate comparable quotes from different plumbers

## When to Use Brand Names vs Generic Descriptions

| Situation | Use Brand Name | Use Generic |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Owner has already purchased the fixture | Yes — plumber needs exact model for rough-in dimensions | N/A |
| Owner has a strong preference | Yes — "or equivalent" | N/A |
| Owner hasn't decided yet | No | Yes — with PC sum allowance |
| Hot water system type matters | Specify type (e.g., "continuous flow gas") | Brand not needed unless specific model selected |
| Tapware finish matters for design | Specify finish (e.g., "matte black", "brushed nickel") | Can leave open with PC sum |
| Compliance items (TMV, backflow) | No — plumber selects compliant product | Yes — "TMV compliant with AS 4032" |

### Key Principle for ScopeAI
> **Specify the "what" and "where" — let the plumber determine the "how."**
> The scope should define what fixtures go where, what connections are required, and what the performance requirements are. The plumber decides pipe routing, material selection (within standards), fitting brands, and installation methods.

# 9.4 Rough-In vs Fit-Off — First Fix and Second Fix

**Confidence:** HIGH (standard Australian trade practice, confirmed across multiple plumbing company sources)

## Why This Separation Matters

Plumbing work in a renovation happens in minimum two site visits, separated by other trades' work:

### Stage 1: Rough-In (First Fix)

**When:** After demolition and framing, BEFORE wall linings (plasterboard), waterproofing, and tiling.

**What happens:**
- All pipework is run through wall cavities, under floors, and through ceiling spaces
- Water supply lines (hot and cold) are run to each fixture location and terminated with capped stubs at the correct set-out positions and heights
- Waste pipes are run from each fixture location to the main drainage, with correct fall and venting
- Gas pipes are run to appliance locations (if applicable)
- Floor waste gullies are set to correct floor levels
- Puddle flanges are installed at shower waste and floor waste locations (critical for waterproofing)
- Rough-in valves for concealed mixers (e.g., shower wall mixer) are installed and secured to framing
- Cistern frames for wall-hung or concealed-cistern toilets are installed and plumbed
- Hot water system pipework is run (if being relocated)
- All rough-in pipework is pressure tested to verify no leaks
- Plumber marks out set-out dimensions for the tiler/waterproofer

**Critical coordination:**
- Rough-in MUST be completed and signed off before waterproofing commences
- The waterproofer needs to know the exact location of all penetrations (pipe through floor/wall)
- Puddle flanges and floor wastes must be at correct level for the tiler to achieve correct falls
- The plumber provides set-out dimensions to the tiler for fixture locations

### Stage 2: Fit-Off (Second Fix)

**When:** After waterproofing, tiling, painting, and cabinetry are complete.

**What happens:**
- All visible fixtures are installed and connected to the rough-in pipework
- Toilets are set on the waste outlet and connected to the cistern supply
- Vanity basins are connected (hot, cold, waste)
- Tapware is installed (basin mixers, shower mixers, bath fillers)
- Shower screens are NOT the plumber's scope — but the shower head, rail, and hand-held are
- Floor waste grates are set to finished level
- Dishwasher connections are made accessible (hot, cold, waste)
- Washing machine taps are installed
- Hot water system is connected and commissioned
- Gas appliances are connected and leak-tested
- All connections are tested for leaks
- Water is turned on and system is commissioned
- Compliance certificate is issued

### Why Scopes Must Separate Rough-In and Fit-Off

1. **Pricing accuracy:** Rough-in is typically 50-60% of the total plumbing cost (more labour-intensive pipework). Fit-off is 40-50%. Separating them allows for accurate quoting.
2. **Scheduling:** The plumber needs to visit site minimum twice, weeks or months apart. Each visit must be scheduled around other trades.
3. **Callout costs:** Each visit attracts travel time and potentially a callout fee. This should be included in the original quote.
4. **Variation management:** If the homeowner changes fixture selections between rough-in and fit-off, only the fit-off scope changes (as long as the set-out is compatible).
5. **Inspection requirements:** In most states, rough-in work must be inspected and photographed before being concealed by waterproofing and wall linings.

### How to Write Scope Items That Cover Both Stages

**Option A: Combined (simpler, preferred for homeowner scopes)**
```
Rough-in and fit-off 1x wall-hung vanity basin. Include hot and
cold water supply, waste connection, and wall-mounted basin mixer.
Basin and tapware to be supplied by owner.
```

**Option B: Separated (more detailed, used by builders/project managers)**
```
ROUGH-IN:
- Run HW and CW supply to vanity location per plan. Cap off at
  correct set-out for wall-mounted basin mixer (centres TBC
  based on selected mixer).
- Run DN40 waste to vanity location. Include P-trap provision.
- Install isolation valves to HW and CW supply lines (accessible
  under vanity).

FIT-OFF:
- Install owner-supplied wall-mounted vanity unit and basin.
- Install owner-supplied basin mixer to rough-in valves.
- Connect basin waste to P-trap and waste line.
- Test all connections. Commission.
```

**Recommendation for ScopeAI:** Use **Option A** (combined) for the homeowner-facing scope. It is simpler, avoids technical errors, and the plumber will naturally split it into rough-in and fit-off in their own quoting and scheduling. Include a note in the preamble that the plumber should allow for minimum two site visits (rough-in and fit-off).

selected WC model specifications (confirm rough-in dimension with
owner before commencing). Position per bathroom plan.
```
*What makes it good:* Notes the critical set-out dependency (toilets have specific rough-in dimensions that vary by model).

*Common variations:*
- "Wall-faced toilet with concealed cistern" — requires in-wall cistern frame (e.g., Geberit Sigma, Caroma Invisi), significant rough-in scope
- "Wall-hung toilet" — requires structural support frame, heavier rough-in
- "Back-to-wall toilet" — similar to wall-faced, cistern concealed
- "Relocate toilet from existing position" — involves drainage modification

**Example 13: Concealed cistern toilet (wall-faced or wall-hung)**
```

# 9.6 Allowances, PC Sums, and Install-Only Wording

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on HIA contract guidance, QBCC guidance, and industry practice)

## Definitions in Australian Building Contract Context

### Prime Cost (PC) Item
- An item that will be **supplied** by the owner (or selected by the owner for the builder/plumber to supply on their behalf)
- The allowance covers **supply cost only** — NOT installation labour
- Installation labour is costed separately in the plumber's quote
- Used when the owner hasn't selected the specific product yet, OR when the plumber doesn't know the exact cost of the owner's selection
- Example: tapware, toilet suites, vanity basins, shower heads, bath

### Provisional Sum (PS)
- An **estimated amount for work** (both materials AND labour) where the full scope is not yet defined
- Used when there is genuine uncertainty about the extent of work required — typically due to hidden conditions
- Example: "provisional sum of $1,500 for drainage remediation" — actual cost depends on what is found when the floor is opened up
- Provisional sums should be reasonable estimates, not low-balls to win the job

### Install Only
- The fixture is **supplied by the owner** (already purchased or will be purchased separately)
- The plumber provides **labour only** for installation and connection
- The plumber is NOT responsible for warranty on the fixture itself — only on the workmanship of the installation
- The plumber may charge a premium or add a disclaimer if the owner-supplied fixture is non-standard or unfamiliar

## How Each Is Written in Plumbing Scopes

### PC Sum Format (Owner Selecting, Plumber Costing the Allowance)

```
ITEM: 1x basin mixer tap for bathroom vanity
PC ALLOWANCE: $350 for owner-selected basin mixer
INSTALLATION: Included in plumbing scope (rough-in and fit-off)
NOTE: If actual fixture cost exceeds PC allowance, difference
will be added to contract price. If actual cost is less,
difference will be credited to owner. Plumber's margin of [X]%
applies to any adjustment (per HIA contract terms).
```

**More concise version (preferred for ScopeAI):**
```
Rough-in and fit-off 1x basin mixer — allow PC sum of $350 for
owner-selected mixer. Installation included.
```

### Provisional Sum Format (Scope Uncertain)

```
ITEM: Repair/replace existing sanitary drainage under bathroom
floor
PROVISIONAL SUM: $2,000 (labour and materials)
SCOPE: Excavate, inspect, and repair or replace existing
drainage as required to achieve compliant drainage for new
bathroom layout. May include new PVC drainage pipe, new
connections, and backfill.
NOTE: Provisional sum is an estimate only. Actual cost will be
determined once existing drainage condition is assessed (after
demolition). Any difference will be adjusted. Plumber to provide
updated quote once drainage is exposed.
```

**More concise version:**
```
Allow provisional sum of $2,000 for drainage remediation under
bathroom floor. Actual scope to be confirmed after demolition
and inspection of existing drainage. Cost adjustment (up or down)
to be agreed before work proceeds.
```

### Install Only Format (Owner Has Already Purchased)

```
ITEM: Install owner-supplied toilet suite (Caroma Luna
close-coupled, model XXXX)
SCOPE: Install only — owner to supply toilet suite including all
fixings, cistern, seat, and connection kit. Plumber to connect
to pre-positioned cold water supply and waste outlet. Set, seal,
and test.
NOTE: Plumber does not warrant owner-supplied fixture. Any damage
to fixture during installation is owner's risk unless caused by
plumber's negligence. Plumber warrants workmanship of connection
and installation only.
```

**More concise version:**
```
Install only: 1x owner-supplied toilet suite. Connect to water
supply and waste. Set, seal, and test. Fixture warranty is
owner's responsibility.
```

### Combined Example (Showing All Three in Context)

```
BATHROOM PLUMBING SCOPE:

1. Rough-in and fit-off 1x shower mixer and shower set.
   Allow PC sum of $800 for owner-selected tapware set.
   Installation included. ← PC SUM

2. Install only: 1x owner-supplied freestanding bath (Caroma
   Aura 1700mm, already purchased). Connect waste, overflow,
   and bath mixer. ← INSTALL ONLY

3. Allow provisional sum of $1,200 for drainage modification
   to accommodate new toilet position. Actual scope TBC after
   demolition. ← PROVISIONAL SUM

4. Supply and install 1x floor waste gully (DN80) with puddle
   flange and tile-insert grate. ← FIXED PRICE (standard S&I)
```

## Key Rules for ScopeAI

When the AI generates a scope, it should use:

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Homeowner hasn't selected fixtures yet | **PC sum** | Allows comparable quoting; actual fixture cost adjusted later |
| Homeowner has already bought the fixture | **Install only** | Plumber quotes labour only; fixture cost is excluded |
| Work depends on hidden conditions | **Provisional sum** | Fair to both parties; prevents lowball quoting |
| Standard plumbing work with clear scope | **Fixed price (S&I)** | Plumber provides firm price including materials and labour |
| Compliance items (TMV, backflow, PLV) | **Supply and install** | Plumber selects compliant product — don't PC sum compliance items |

## PC Sum Ranges for Common Plumbing Fixtures (2024-2026)

These are suggested PC allowances the AI can use when the homeowner hasn't selected fixtures:

| Fixture | Budget | Mid-Range | Premium | Luxury |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Basin mixer tap | $150-200 | $250-400 | $500-800 | $800-1,500 |
| Shower mixer + head set | $200-350 | $400-800 | $800-1,500 | $1,500-3,000 |
| Kitchen mixer tap | $150-250 | $300-500 | $600-1,000 | $1,000-2,000 |
| Toilet suite (close-coupled) | $200-350 | $400-700 | $800-1,500 | $1,500-3,000 |
| Toilet suite (concealed cistern, wall-faced) | $500-800 | $900-1,500 | $1,500-2,500 | $2,500+ |
| Freestanding bath | $500-1,000 | $1,200-2,500 | $3,000-6,000 | $6,000-15,000 |
| Built-in bath | $300-600 | $700-1,200 | $1,500-3,000 | $3,000+ |
| Vanity unit + basin | $300-600 | $700-1,500 | $1,500-3,500 | $3,500-8,000 |
| Kitchen sink (undermount SS) | $200-400 | $400-700 | $800-1,500 | $1,500-3,000 |
| Laundry tub + cabinet | $200-400 | $400-700 | $800-1,200 | N/A |
| Floor waste grate (tile-insert) | $50-80 | $100-200 | $200-400 | $400+ |
| Heated towel rail (electric) | $200-400 | $400-800 | $800-1,500 | $1,500+ |
| Shower drain (linear/channel) | $150-300 | $350-600 | $700-1,200 | $1,200+ |

**Note:** These are fixture supply costs only (PC allowance). Installation labour is separate and included in the plumber's overall quote.

## What Goes in the Preamble

The preamble sets the ground rules for the entire scope. For a homeowner-generated scope (ScopeAI's output), the preamble should include:

```
GENERAL CONDITIONS

1. All plumbing work to comply with AS/NZS 3500:2025 (Plumbing
   and Drainage), the Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA), and all
   relevant state and local regulations.

2. All gas work to comply with AS/NZS 5601 (Gas Installations)
   where applicable. Gas compliance certificate to be issued
   for all gas work.

3. Plumbing compliance certificate to be issued within 5 business
   days of completion of plumbing work.

4. All plumbing products to carry WaterMark certification as
   required by the Plumbing Code of Australia. All water fixtures
   to carry WELS rating.

5. Plumber to allow for minimum two (2) site visits:
   - Rough-in (first fix) — after demolition/framing, before
     waterproofing and wall linings
   - Fit-off (second fix) — after tiling, painting, and
     cabinetry installation are complete

6. Plumber to coordinate timing with:
   - Demolition contractor (strip-out complete before rough-in)
   - Waterproofer (rough-in complete before waterproofing)
   - Tiler (floor waste levels and puddle flanges set correctly)
   - Carpenter/cabinet maker (vanity and sink locations confirmed)
   - Electrician (if shared penetrations or coordination needed)

7. Owner-supplied fixtures: Where noted as "owner to supply" or
   "PC sum", the owner is responsible for purchasing and
   delivering fixtures to site before fit-off. Plumber to
   confirm fixture selection with owner before rough-in to
   ensure correct set-out dimensions.

8. Access: This scope assumes reasonable access for plumbing
   work. If access is restricted (e.g., concrete slab, cavity
   brick, limited ceiling space), additional costs may apply.
```

## How Exclusions Are Listed

Exclusions should be listed clearly and unambiguously:

```
EXCLUSIONS — The following items are NOT included in this
plumbing scope:

1.  Supply of owner-selected fixtures (tapware, toilet suite,
    vanity, bath, shower set) — installation of these items IS
    included where noted in the scope above
2.  Waterproofing (by licensed waterproofer — separate trade)
3.  Tiling (by licensed tiler — separate trade)
4.  Electrical work (by licensed electrician — separate trade)
5.  Carpentry/framing work, including wall reinforcement for
    wall-hung fixtures
6.  Plaster patching, painting, or making good of surfaces after
    pipe runs
7.  Asbestos identification, testing, or removal
8.  Concrete cutting/coring for slab penetrations (unless
    specifically included above)
9.  Stormwater drainage or downpipe work (unless specifically
    included)
10. Council/water authority fees, permits, or inspection fees
11. Structural work (load-bearing walls, floor joists, etc.)
12. Remediation of existing non-compliant plumbing work
    (quoted separately if discovered)
13. Roof plumbing (gutters, downpipes, flashings)
14. Tree root removal from drainage (quoted separately if
    discovered during CCTV inspection)
15. Fixture delivery to site
16. Builder's temporary facilities (temporary toilet, water supply)
17. Fire services (sprinklers, hydrants)
```

## How Assumptions Are Stated

Assumptions protect both the plumber and the homeowner by stating what conditions were assumed when preparing the scope/quote:

```
ASSUMPTIONS — This scope is based on the following assumptions:

1. Existing water supply pressure is adequate for the proposed
   fixtures (mains pressure system assumed). If pressure is
   below 200kPa or above 500kPa, additional work (booster pump
   or PLV) may be required at additional cost.

2. Existing drainage is in serviceable condition and can accept
   new connections. If drainage is found to be damaged,
   collapsed, or non-compliant during works, remediation will
   be quoted as a variation.

3. Existing hot water system is adequate for the proposed
   fixture load (unless HWS replacement is included in scope).

4. Property is connected to mains sewer (not septic system).
   If septic, additional considerations apply.

5. Single-storey dwelling with accessible ceiling space for
   pipe routing (unless otherwise noted).

6. Standard wall construction (timber frame with plasterboard
   lining). Cavity brick, concrete, or heritage construction
   may require additional labour and cost.

7. All demolition will be completed by others before plumber's
   rough-in visit. Plumber arrives to stripped-out room with
   framing exposed.

8. Owner-supplied fixtures will be on site and available at the
   time of fit-off.

9. Other trades (tiler, waterproofer, carpenter) will complete
   their work between rough-in and fit-off, allowing plumber
   access for fit-off without delay.

10. No hazardous materials (asbestos, lead) will be encountered.
    If encountered, work will stop and remediation will be
    required before plumber continues.
```

## Sign-Off Requirements

For a homeowner-generated scope (ScopeAI's output), the scope document does not need a formal sign-off — it is a briefing document the homeowner provides to plumbers for quoting. However, the scope should note:

```
IMPORTANT: This scope of works has been generated to help
homeowners obtain comparable quotes from licensed plumbers.
It is not a contract and is not a substitute for a professional
site assessment. Plumbers should conduct their own site
inspection before quoting.

Once a plumber is selected, this scope should form the basis
of a formal contract or detailed quotation that both parties
sign before work commences.
```

================================================================
NOTE
================================================================

This scope of works is a briefing document to assist in
obtaining comparable quotes from licensed plumbers. It is not a
contract. Plumbers should conduct their own site inspection
before quoting. Variations from this scope must be agreed in
writing before work proceeds.

================================================================
```

### Annotation: Why This Scope Is Structured This Way

1. **General Conditions first** — Sets expectations for standards, visits, and coordination before getting into detail. Every plumber reading this knows the ground rules.

2. **Disconnection/strip-out separated** — This is often forgotten in homeowner scopes. The plumber needs to disconnect services before demolition can proceed safely. Putting it first mirrors the actual work sequence.

3. **Rough-in grouped by service type (water, drainage, gas)** — Rather than by fixture. This is how plumbers think about rough-in — they run all the water supply at once, then all the drainage, rather than doing one fixture at a time.

4. **Fit-off grouped by fixture** — This is how plumbers think about fit-off — they install one fixture completely before moving to the next.

5. **PC sums in a schedule** — Summarising all PC items in a table makes it easy for the plumber to see total fixture allowances at a glance, and easy for the homeowner to track selections.

6. **Provisional sums separated** — Clearly distinguished from PC sums because they serve a different purpose (uncertain scope vs uncertain product selection).

7. **Exclusions are comprehensive** — No ambiguity about what's NOT included. This prevents scope disputes.

8. **Assumptions are explicit** — If any assumption turns out to be wrong, both parties know it was flagged upfront, and a variation can be fairly discussed.

### Annotation: Why This Kitchen Scope Is Different from the Bathroom

1. **Island bench is the major scope driver** — Running plumbing through the floor to an island bench is the single most complex and expensive item in a kitchen plumbing scope. This is why the scope devotes significant detail to it, including provisional sums and coordination notes.

2. **Gas is a separate section** — Kitchens often involve gas work (cooktop), which requires its own compliance certificate. Bathrooms rarely involve gas (unless hydronic heating).

3. **Fewer fixtures but more complexity** — A kitchen typically has fewer plumbing fixtures than a bathroom (sink, dishwasher, maybe gas, maybe instant hot water) but the fixture positions relative to drainage are often more complex, especially with islands.

4. **More trade coordination** — Kitchen plumbing must coordinate closely with the cabinet maker (sink cutout, dishwasher position), stone mason (benchtop cutout), and builder (slab penetration). The scope reflects this.

5. **Different PC sum approach** — In the bathroom, the major cost is in fixtures (tapware, toilet, bath). In the kitchen, the major fixture is the mixer tap and (if included) the instant hot water system. The sink itself is often a simpler selection.

# 9.10 Scope Language Do's and Don'ts

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on Australian trade forums, builder websites, and contract dispute resources)

## Do's

### 1. DO use specific quantities
```
GOOD: "Supply and install 2x outdoor hose cocks"
BAD:  "Install some outdoor taps"
```
Without a quantity, the plumber quotes one, the homeowner expected three. Dispute.

### 2. DO specify who supplies what
```
GOOD: "Install 1x owner-supplied toilet suite"
GOOD: "Supply and install 1x toilet suite (allow PC sum of $700)"
BAD:  "Install new toilet"  (who buys it?)
```
This is the single most common source of scope disputes in plumbing. If the scope says "install new toilet" the plumber may assume the owner is buying it, the owner may assume it is included in the plumber's price.

### 3. DO reference the plan
```
GOOD: "Position per bathroom plan (attached)"
GOOD: "Per kitchen layout plan dated [date]"
BAD:  "Somewhere near the window"
```
Positions should be confirmed with a plan. Even a hand-drawn sketch is better than a verbal description.

### 4. DO include connection details
```
GOOD: "Include hot and cold water supply, waste with S-trap,
       and 2x isolation valves"
BAD:  "Install kitchen sink"
```
A kitchen sink needs HW, CW, waste, trap, and isolation. If you just say "install kitchen sink" the plumber may quote for the bare minimum connection and charge extra for each additional item.

### 5. DO state what is excluded
```
GOOD: "EXCLUDES: Waterproofing, tiling, electrical work,
       supply of owner-selected fixtures"
BAD:  (no exclusions listed — everything is ambiguous)
```

### 6. DO use "or equivalent" when naming brands
```
GOOD: "Concealed cistern carrier frame (Geberit Sigma 8 or
       equivalent)"
BAD:  "Geberit Sigma 8 only — no substitutions"
```
Unless the homeowner has a specific reason to insist on a brand, "or equivalent" allows the plumber to use their preferred supplier, potentially saving cost.

### 7. DO separate rough-in and fit-off (or note both are included)
```
GOOD: "Rough-in and fit-off 1x shower"
BAD:  "Install shower" (does this include rough-in? or just fit-off?)
```

### 8. DO flag dependencies and coordination
```
GOOD: "Note: Rough-in must be completed before waterproofing.
       Plumber to confirm set-out with tiler before tiling
       commences."
BAD:  (no coordination notes — leads to costly mis-sequencing)
```

### 9. DO use provisional sums for genuine unknowns
```
GOOD: "Allow provisional sum of $1,000 for drainage remediation.
       Actual scope TBC after demolition."
BAD:  "Fix the drainage" (scope undefined, price undefined)
BAD:  "Drainage remediation — TBD" (no budget guidance at all)
```

### 10. DO include compliance requirements
```
GOOD: "Issue plumbing compliance certificate on completion"
GOOD: "All fixtures to carry WaterMark certification"
BAD:  (no mention of compliance — plumber may skip certificates)
```

---

## Don'ts

### 1. DON'T use ambiguous language
```
BAD:  "Make the plumbing nice"
BAD:  "Standard plumbing"
BAD:  "As discussed"
BAD:  "As per industry standard"
BAD:  "All necessary plumbing work"
BAD:  "General plumbing for renovation"
BAD:  "Fix any issues found"
```
Every one of these phrases will be interpreted differently by every plumber. "As discussed" is especially dangerous — there is no written record of what was discussed.

### 2. DON'T assume the plumber knows the layout
```
BAD:  "Install sink where it goes"
BAD:  "Same position as before"
BAD:  "You'll see where it needs to go"
```
Even for like-for-like replacements, confirm positions. "Same position" might mean 50mm different to the plumber than to the homeowner, and 50mm matters when tiles are already cut.

### 3. DON'T forget the waste/drainage side
```
BAD:  "Install new vanity basin"
       (only mentions the basin — what about the waste, trap,
       and drainage connection?)
```
Homeowners almost always focus on the water supply side (taps, mixers) and forget that every fixture also needs waste/drainage. The scope must cover both.

### 4. DON'T over-specify pipe routing
```
BAD:  "Run 15mm copper pipe along north wall, turn left at
       corner, drop through floor at grid line B3, run under
       slab for 2.4m, rise through slab at island position..."
```
Pipe routing is the plumber's professional decision based on site conditions, access, and efficiency. The scope should specify **where** the pipes need to end up, not **how** to get there.

### 5. DON'T use vague location references
```
BAD:  "Near the window"
BAD:  "On the left side"
BAD:  "Roughly in the middle"
```
Use: "per plan", "per drawing", or specific measurements (e.g., "centreline 600mm from left wall").

### 6. DON'T mix plumbing scope with other trades
```
BAD:  "Install shower including tiling, waterproofing, and
       plumbing"
```
The plumbing scope should contain ONLY plumbing work. Reference other trades in exclusions or coordination notes, but don't include their scope items in the plumbing document. This ensures each trade quotes their own work without overlap or gaps.

### 7. DON'T leave out the hot water system
```
BAD:  (Entire bathroom scope with no mention of hot water)
```
Every renovation with new or relocated fixtures should address the hot water system. Is it adequate? Does it need a new tempering valve? Is it being relocated? Even if the answer is "existing HWS adequate — no change", state it explicitly.

### 8. DON'T ignore backflow prevention
```
BAD:  (Outdoor hose cock scope with no mention of backflow)
```
Backflow prevention is mandatory for outdoor taps, bidets, and any connection that could allow contamination of the potable water supply. The scope should include it.

### 9. DON'T use "allow for" without a specific amount
```
BAD:  "Allow for any drainage work required"
BAD:  "Allow for unforeseen issues"
```
These open-ended phrases give the plumber a blank cheque. Use provisional sums with a specific dollar amount and a defined scope of what it covers.

### 10. DON'T forget testing and certification
```
BAD:  (Entire plumbing scope with no mention of pressure testing,
       commissioning, or compliance certificates)
```
Testing and certification are legally required and should be explicitly included. If a plumber's quote doesn't mention a compliance certificate, that is a red flag.

---

## How to Handle Unknowns (Provisional Items)

When the scope has genuine unknowns (common in renovation work), handle them with structured provisional items:

### Template for Provisional Items:
```
PROVISIONAL ITEM: [Description of uncertain work]
PROVISIONAL SUM: $[Amount] (labour and materials)
SCOPE: [Best estimate of what the work might involve]
TRIGGER: [What condition will activate this item — e.g.,
"if existing drainage is found to be damaged during demolition"]
PROCESS: Plumber to inspect, report findings to owner, and
provide updated quote before proceeding. Owner to approve
variation in writing before work commences.
NOTE: If provisional item is not required, the full provisional
sum is credited back to the owner.
```

### Common Provisional Items in Plumbing Scopes:
- Drainage remediation / replacement (hidden condition)
- Slab penetration (complexity unknown until slab is assessed)
- Existing pipework replacement (condition unknown until walls are opened)
- Hot water system upgrade (capacity may be insufficient for new fixtures — TBC after assessment)
- Backflow prevention device upgrade (hazard rating TBC after water authority assessment)
- Tree root removal from drainage (extent unknown until CCTV inspection)

---

## How to Reference Plans and Drawings

When the scope references a plan:

```
GOOD: "Position per bathroom plan (Drawing No. BA-01,
       Rev B, dated [date])"
GOOD: "Per kitchen layout by [Kitchen Company], dated [date]"
GOOD: "Per attached sketch (hand-drawn, signed by owner,
       dated [date])"
```

Even for ScopeAI (where there may not be a formal plan), the scope should reference:
```
"Position per owner's indicated layout (confirmed during
scope questionnaire). Exact positions to be confirmed with
plumber during site inspection before rough-in."
```

This flags to the plumber that positions need site verification, while giving them enough information to provide an indicative quote.

---

## What Plumbers Prefer to See in a Scope

Based on analysis of Australian plumber websites and trade forums:

1. **A clear list of fixtures** — what goes where, how many
2. **Who supplies what** — "owner supply" vs "plumber supply" for each fixture
3. **Access information** — slab or timber floor, wall type, ceiling access
4. **Current conditions** — age of existing plumbing, known issues
5. **A plan or sketch** — even hand-drawn is valuable
6. **Photos** — of current bathroom/kitchen, current plumbing, current hot water system
7. **Fixture selections** (if made) — specific models with rough-in dimensions
8. **Timeline** — when is demolition, when is tiling, when do they need to rough-in and fit-off
9. **Budget indication** — knowing whether the project is budget or premium helps the plumber suggest appropriate solutions

**What plumbers DON'T want:**
- Pinterest boards without any technical information
- Vague verbal descriptions
- Scopes mixed with other trades' work
- Over-specified pipe routing that constrains their professional judgement
- Scope items that change every week (scope lock is important)
