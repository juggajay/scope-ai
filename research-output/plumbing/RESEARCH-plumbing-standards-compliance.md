## 1. AS/NZS 3500 (Plumbing and Drainage) Overview

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 1.1 What Is AS/NZS 3500?

AS/NZS 3500 is the primary Australian and New Zealand Standard governing plumbing and drainage. It is referenced in the National Construction Code (NCC) Volume Three — the Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA). This means compliance with AS/NZS 3500 is a legal requirement for all plumbing work in Australia, including renovations.

The standard is published by Standards Australia and is divided into multiple parts:

| Part | Title | Current Version | Published |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| AS/NZS 3500.0 | Glossary of terms | AS/NZS 3500.0:2021 | 2021 |
| AS/NZS 3500.1 | Water services | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 | April 2025 |
| AS/NZS 3500.2 | Sanitary plumbing and drainage | AS/NZS 3500.2:2025 | April 2025 |
| AS/NZS 3500.3 | Stormwater drainage | AS/NZS 3500.3:2025 | April 2025 |
| AS/NZS 3500.4 | Heated water services | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 | April 2025 |
| AS/NZS 3500.5 | Housing installations | AS/NZS 3500.5:2021 | 2021 |

### 1.2 The 2025 Update

On 17 April 2025, Standards Australia published the 2025 edition of the AS/NZS 3500 series (Parts 1-4), replacing the 2021 editions. Key changes include:

- **Part 1 (Water Services):** Changes to Table 4.4 aligning with international practices, elevating Atmospheric Vacuum Breakers (AVBs) to high hazard testable devices
- **Part 3 (Stormwater):** Valley gutter catchment area increased from 20 m2 (2021 edition) to 40 m2 (2025 edition)
- Various clarifications and corrections across all parts

### 1.3 Transition Period

Plumbing practitioners must ensure all plumbing work commenced on or after **20 October 2025** complies with the 2025 version of the standard. However, adoption and transition periods vary across jurisdictions — practitioners should check with their local authority. As of February 2026, the 2025 standards are the current mandatory requirement in most jurisdictions.

**Scope impact:** Scope documents generated from late 2025 onwards should reference AS/NZS 3500:2025. The AI should always specify compliance with the current version of AS/NZS 3500 without hard-coding a specific year, and instead use language like "in accordance with AS/NZS 3500 (current edition)" to remain future-proof.

## 2. AS/NZS 3500.0 — Glossary of Terms

**Confidence:** HIGH

AS/NZS 3500.0 provides the definitions used throughout the entire 3500 series. The following terms are critical for renovation scope documents and must be used correctly:

### 2.1 Key Definitions for Scope Documents

| Term | Definition | Why It Matters for Scopes |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Fixture** | A receptacle or device connected to a water supply or drainage system (e.g. basin, toilet, shower, sink) | The scope must identify all fixtures being installed, relocated, or replaced |
| **Fixture Unit (FU)** | A numerical measure of the load-producing effect of a fixture on the plumbing system | Used for pipe sizing calculations; relevant when adding fixtures |
| **Rough-in** | The initial installation of pipes, fittings and fixtures concealed within the building structure, before wall and floor coverings are applied | A critical scope stage — must be separated from fit-off |
| **Fit-off** | The final connection and installation of visible fixtures and fittings after wall and floor coverings are complete | Second critical plumbing scope stage |
| **Trap** | A fitting or device designed to retain a body of water to prevent the passage of foul air while permitting the flow of sewage | Every fixture requires a trap; scope must account for trap installation |
| **Vent** | A pipe or system of pipes that allows air movement within the drainage system to prevent trap seal loss | Scope must include venting provisions |
| **Backflow** | Flow of water in a direction contrary to the intended direction of flow | Triggers backflow prevention device requirements |
| **Potable water** | Water that is suitable for human consumption | Scope must clearly distinguish potable from non-potable systems |
| **WaterMark** | The certification scheme for plumbing products in Australia | All products specified in scope must be WaterMark certified |
| **Tempering valve** | A valve that blends hot and cold water to deliver water at a controlled temperature not exceeding 50 degrees C | Required at personal hygiene outlets |
| **Thermostatic mixing valve (TMV)** | A valve that automatically maintains water at a selected temperature by mixing hot and cold water, with fail-safe mechanisms | Required in healthcare, aged care, childcare facilities |
| **Overflow relief gully (ORG)** | A gully fitted with a relief-type grate that permits overflow of sewage at a controlled location | Required on every residential drainage system |
| **Inspection opening (IO)** | A capped opening in a drain or pipe that provides access for inspection and clearing | Must be installed at specified intervals |
| **Inspection shaft (IS)** | A vertical shaft providing access to underground drains for inspection and maintenance | Required at junction points and specified intervals |
| **Sewer service diagram (SSD)** | A diagram showing the location of private sewer/drainage pipes on a property | Required to be submitted after drainage work |

**Scope impact:** The AI must use these terms correctly and consistently throughout every generated scope. Incorrect terminology will undermine the professional credibility of the scope document and confuse tradies.

## 3. AS/NZS 3500.1 — Water Services

**Current version:** AS/NZS 3500.1:2025
**Confidence:** HIGH (direct standard references)

This part covers the design, installation, and commissioning of cold water services. It applies to new installations as well as alterations, additions, and repairs.

### 3.1 Approved Pipe Materials

| Material | Standard | Common Residential Use | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Copper tube | AS 1432 | Hot and cold water, traditional installations | Minimum 0.9mm wall thickness. Durable but more expensive. Most common in existing homes |
| Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) | AS 2492 | Hot and cold water, modern installations | Flexible, easier to install in renovation contexts. Must not be exposed to UV |
| Polybutylene (PB) | AS/NZS 4020 | Hot and cold water | Less common now, some concerns about long-term durability |
| PVC-U (unplasticised PVC) | AS/NZS 1477 | Cold water only | Cannot be used for hot water. Common for cold water mains connections |
| PE (polyethylene) | AS/NZS 4130 | Underground cold water services | Used for water main connections to meter |
| Stainless steel | AS 4020 / WaterMark certified | Hot and cold water | Premium option, increasingly used in high-end renovations |

**Critical requirement:** ALL pipe materials and fittings used must carry WaterMark certification. Products without WaterMark certification cannot be legally installed in Australia. The WaterMark scheme replaced the old state-based approval systems.

**Scope impact:** Scope documents should specify the pipe material to be used (e.g., "Replace existing copper pipework with new PEX pipework" or "New copper pipework to all relocated fixtures"). If the homeowner has a preference or the plumber recommends a specific material, it should be noted. Where a renovation involves connecting new pipework to existing, the scope should note any required adapters or transition fittings.

### 3.2 Pipe Sizing

AS/NZS 3500.1 uses fixture units (FU) to calculate demand and determine minimum pipe sizes. The standard provides detailed sizing tables. For residential renovations, the following are the most commonly encountered sizes:

| Application | Typical Pipe Size (DN) | Notes |
|------------|----------------------|-------|
| Water main connection to meter | DN 20 (3/4") or DN 25 (1") | Depends on number of fixtures and distance |
| Main internal cold water line | DN 20 (3/4") | From meter to first tee-off |
| Branch to individual fixture | DN 15 (1/2") | Standard for basins, toilets, most taps |
| Branch to bath | DN 15 or DN 20 | Larger pipe for faster fill rate |
| Hot water service connection | DN 20 (3/4") | Supply to and from hot water unit |
| Outdoor hose tap | DN 15 (1/2") or DN 20 | May need larger for irrigation |
| Kitchen sink | DN 15 (1/2") | Both hot and cold |
| Dishwasher | DN 15 (1/2") | Cold water connection |
| Washing machine | DN 15 (1/2") or DN 20 | Both hot and cold taps |

**Key requirements:**
- Maximum permitted velocity: 3 m/s (best practice: 2.2 m/s to reduce noise and wear)
- Minimum pressure at fixture: 50 kPa (5 metres head) — this is the absolute minimum; realistic usable pressure is approximately 150-200 kPa (15-20 metres head) for most fixtures
- Maximum pressure: 500 kPa (50 metres head) — pressure-reducing valve required if supply pressure exceeds this
- Where supply pressure exceeds 500 kPa, a pressure-limiting valve compliant with AS 1357.1 must be installed

**Scope impact:** When adding fixtures in a renovation (e.g., adding a second basin to a bathroom, adding an outdoor tap), the plumber must verify that existing pipe sizes are adequate for the increased demand. The scope should note "verify existing water service capacity for additional fixtures" or "upgrade water service size if required." This is especially important in older homes with DN 15 (1/2") mains connections.

### 3.3 Isolation Valves

AS/NZS 3500.1 requires isolation valves at specific locations:

| Location | Requirement |
|----------|------------|
| Main stopcock | At or near the water meter / property boundary — must be accessible |
| Each dwelling unit | Individual isolation valve if multi-unit |
| Hot water system | Isolation valve on cold water inlet |
| Each backflow prevention device | Isolation valves upstream and downstream |
| Each tempering/mixing valve | Isolation valves for maintenance access |
| Individual fixtures | Recommended (not always mandatory for residential) — mini stop cocks under basins, behind toilets, etc. |

**Scope impact:** Renovation scopes should include "install isolation valve to each new fixture" as standard practice. This allows individual fixtures to be serviced without shutting down the entire water supply. For older homes being renovated, the scope should note "install new main isolation valve if existing valve is non-functional or missing."

### 3.4 Pressure Considerations

| Scenario | Action Required |
|----------|----------------|
| Supply pressure below 150 kPa | Pressure pump may be needed for adequate flow |
| Supply pressure above 500 kPa | Pressure-limiting valve (PLV) required |
| Pressure difference between hot and cold at a mixer | Can cause temperature fluctuation; balanced pressure connections or individual pressure regulation may be needed |
| Multi-storey buildings | Pressure reduction at lower levels may be required |

**Scope impact:** For renovations in areas with known high or low water pressure (common in hilly suburbs, high-rise buildings, or rural areas), the scope should include a note about pressure testing and any required pressure regulation devices.

### 3.5 Water Hammer Prevention

AS/NZS 3500.1 requires provisions to prevent water hammer (hydraulic shock) in water supply systems. In residential renovations:

- Quick-closing valves (e.g., ceramic disc mixer taps, solenoid valves on washing machines/dishwashers) are the most common cause
- Water hammer arrestors should be installed near quick-closing valves
- Common locations: washing machine taps, dishwasher connection, ceramic disc mixer taps

**Scope impact:** Include "supply and install water hammer arrestors at washing machine and dishwasher connections" in kitchen and laundry renovation scopes. For bathroom renovations with new mixer taps, include water hammer arrestors where necessary.

## 4. AS/NZS 3500.2 — Sanitary Plumbing and Drainage

**Current version:** AS/NZS 3500.2:2025
**Confidence:** HIGH (direct standard references)

This part covers the design and installation of sanitary plumbing and drainage from fixtures to the sewer connection, common effluent system, or on-site wastewater management system. It applies to new installations as well as alterations, additions, and repairs.

### 4.1 Trap Requirements

Every fixture connected to the drainage system must have a water-sealed trap to prevent sewer gases entering the building.

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Minimum trap seal depth** | 50 mm |
| **Maximum trap seal depth** | 100 mm |
| **Trap types** | P-trap (horizontal outlet), S-trap (vertical outlet), bottle trap (compact, for basins) |
| **S-trap restrictions** | S-traps are not permitted in some jurisdictions and are generally discouraged due to higher risk of siphonage. P-traps are preferred |
| **Bottle trap restrictions** | Permitted for basins only; not permitted for sinks with food waste or high-volume discharge |
| **Floor waste traps** | Required in bathrooms, laundries, and other wet areas. Minimum 50mm seal depth |
| **Trap access** | All traps must be accessible for cleaning and maintenance |

**Common residential trap sizes:**

| Fixture | Minimum Trap Size (DN) |
|---------|----------------------|
| Wash basin | DN 32 or DN 40 |
| Bath | DN 40 or DN 50 |
| Shower | DN 50 |
| Kitchen sink | DN 40 or DN 50 |
| Laundry tub | DN 40 or DN 50 |
| Floor waste | DN 50 or DN 65 |
| Toilet (WC) | Integral trap (built into pan) — DN 80 or DN 100 outlet |

**Scope impact:** Every fixture in a renovation scope must have a trap specified. When relocating fixtures, the existing trap may not be reusable and a new trap must be included. For bathroom renovations with tiled floors, specify "supply and install floor waste gully with 50mm water seal" as a line item. S-traps should be replaced with P-traps where possible during renovation.

### 4.2 Drainage Pipe Grades (Fall/Gradient)

Correct pipe grades are critical for effective drainage. Insufficient fall causes blockages; excessive fall can cause the water to outrun solids, also causing blockages.

| Pipe Size (DN) | Minimum Grade | Maximum Grade | Common Expression |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| DN 40 | 1:40 (2.5%) | — | 25 mm fall per metre |
| DN 50 | 1:40 (2.5%) | — | 25 mm fall per metre |
| DN 65 | 1:40 (2.5%) | 1:15 (6.7%) | 25 mm fall per metre |
| DN 80 | 1:60 (1.65%) | 1:15 (6.7%) | 16.5 mm fall per metre |
| DN 100 | 1:60 (1.65%) | 1:15 (6.7%) | 16.5 mm fall per metre |
| DN 150 | 1:80 (1.25%) | 1:15 (6.7%) | 12.5 mm fall per metre |

**Key principles:**
- Grades are expressed as a percentage of vertical to horizontal distance
- Minimum grade ensures waste flows properly
- Maximum grade prevents water separating from solids (siphonage)
- Grades must be uniform — no dips or sags allowed
- Professional plumbers use spirit levels and laser levels to verify grades during installation

**Scope impact:** The scope should note "all drainage pipework to be installed to grades compliant with AS/NZS 3500.2." Where a renovation involves relocating drainage under a concrete slab, the scope must note that the slab will need to be cut and the drainage re-laid to correct grades — this is a significant cost item. The scope should also note "verify adequate fall available between fixture and sewer connection before commencing work."

### 4.3 Drainage Pipe Materials

| Material | Standard | Common Use |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| uPVC (unplasticised PVC) | AS/NZS 1254 | Most common for residential drainage, both above and below ground |
| Cast iron | — | Found in older homes; often replaced during renovation |
| Vitreous clay (earthenware) | AS 1741 | Found in very old homes; always replaced during renovation |
| High-density polyethylene (HDPE) | AS/NZS 4130 | Below ground, sometimes in difficult access situations |
| Copper | AS 1432 | Waste pipes in some older premium installations |

**Scope impact:** In renovation contexts, existing drainage is often cast iron or earthenware. The scope should note "replace existing [material] drainage with new uPVC drainage to AS/NZS 1254" and include disposal of old pipes. Where connecting new uPVC to existing cast iron, appropriate transition couplings (e.g., Fernco or similar flexible couplings) must be specified.

### 4.4 Venting Requirements

The drainage system must be vented to:
- Prevent trap seal loss through siphonage
- Allow air into the drainage system for proper flow
- Release sewer gases safely above the roofline

**Key venting rules:**

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Stack vent** | All discharge stacks (vertical pipes collecting waste from multiple fixtures) must have an open vent terminating above the roofline |
| **Branch vent** | Branch drains exceeding 10 metres in length must be vented with an open vent |
| **Minimum upstream vent on main drain** | DN 50 minimum |
| **Minimum upstream vent on branch drain** | DN 40 minimum |
| **Vent termination** | Open vents must terminate at least 150 mm above the roof surface and be protected with a vent cowl |
| **Vent distance from trap** | Venting must be provided within 1.5 metres of the trap |
| **Air Admittance Valves (AAVs)** | Permitted ONLY on second and subsequent stacks. At least one open vent to atmosphere is always required. AAVs must comply with the standard and be installed in accessible locations |
| **Unvented branch drains** | Permitted for limited lengths and fixture unit loads as specified in the standard — subject to specific conditions |

**Scope impact:** Venting is one of the most commonly overlooked items in renovation scopes. When adding or relocating fixtures, the scope must account for venting. Typical scope line items include:
- "Extend existing vent stack through new roof penetration with galvanised vent cowl"
- "Install air admittance valve to new branch drain serving relocated basin"
- "Install new vent pipe from relocated toilet to nearest vent stack"

Where a renovation adds fixtures on a new branch line remote from the existing vent stack, significant additional venting work may be required. This is especially common in kitchen island installations where the sink is remote from any wall that connects to the vent stack.

### 4.5 Access Points (Inspection Openings and Shafts)

The drainage system must have sufficient access points for inspection and maintenance:

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Inspection openings (IOs)** | Capped openings in the drainage pipe for rodding and inspection |
| **Inspection shafts (ISs)** | Vertical shafts to below-ground drains for access |
| **IO at base of stack** | Required at the base of every discharge stack |
| **IO at changes of direction** | Required at every change of direction greater than 45 degrees |
| **IO spacing — branch drains** | Not further than 2.5 metres from the junction of a branch drain connecting WC or slop hopper |
| **IO spacing — main drains** | At intervals not greater than 30 metres, minimum one IO on each main drain |
| **IO at junction with sewer** | Inspection shaft or boundary trap required at or near the point of connection to the sewer |
| **Overflow relief gully (ORG)** | Required on every residential drainage system; must be located at a level lower than the lowest sanitary fixture in the building; designed to overflow outside if a blockage occurs, rather than flooding inside |
| **ORG location** | Must be readily accessible and visible; typically installed outside the building near the lowest fixture |

**Scope impact:** When renovation drainage work is done, the scope must include inspection openings at all required locations. Include line items such as:
- "Supply and install inspection opening at base of new stack"
- "Supply and install overflow relief gully adjacent to building"
- "Provide minimum one inspection shaft on new main drain run"

For bathroom renovations involving drainage work, ensure the scope includes an IO accessible from outside the finished room.

### 4.6 Fixture Unit Loadings

Fixture units (FU) determine drain sizing. Common residential values:

| Fixture | Fixture Units (FU) | Minimum Drain Size (DN) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Basin (wash basin) | 1.0 | DN 32 or DN 40 |
| Bath | 2.0 | DN 40 or DN 50 |
| Shower | 2.0 | DN 50 |
| Kitchen sink (single bowl) | 1.5 | DN 40 or DN 50 |
| Kitchen sink (double bowl) | 2.0 | DN 50 |
| Laundry tub (single) | 2.0 | DN 40 |
| Laundry tub (double) | 3.0 | DN 50 |
| Washing machine | 2.0 | DN 40 or DN 50 |
| Dishwasher | 1.0 | DN 40 |
| Toilet (WC) | 4.0 | DN 100 (or DN 80 with specific conditions) |
| Floor waste | 0 (does not add FU) | DN 50 or DN 65 |

**Scope impact:** When adding fixtures in a renovation, the plumber must verify that existing drain sizes can handle the increased fixture unit loading. The scope should note "verify existing drainage capacity for additional fixtures" where fixtures are being added to an existing branch.

---

## 5. AS/NZS 3500.4 — Heated Water Services

**Current version:** AS/NZS 3500.4:2025
**Confidence:** HIGH

This part covers the design, installation, and commissioning of heated water services using drinking water or rainwater or a combination thereof.

### 5.1 Tempering Valve Requirements

**This is one of the most critical plumbing compliance items in any residential renovation.**

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Maximum delivery temperature** | 50 degrees C at all sanitary fixtures used primarily for personal hygiene purposes |
| **Fixtures requiring temperature control** | Baths, showers, basins, bidets — any fixture where a person is likely to come into contact with the water |
| **Kitchen sink** | NOT required to have a tempering valve (kitchen sinks are not considered "personal hygiene" fixtures). However, some jurisdictions or individual plumbers may install them as best practice |
| **Laundry tub** | NOT required to have a tempering valve |
| **Control device options** | Tempering valve (adjusted to max 50 degrees C), or thermostatic mixing valve (TMV) adjusted to max 50 degrees C, or water heater marked to deliver water not exceeding 50 degrees C |
| **Storage temperature** | Hot water storage systems must store water at a minimum of 60 degrees C to prevent Legionella bacteria growth |
| **Instantaneous systems** | If the heater delivers water at or below 50 degrees C, no tempering valve is required. If it delivers above 50 degrees C, a tempering valve is required |

### 5.2 Tempering Valve vs TMV — When to Use Each

| Device | Standard | Max Output | Use Case | Servicing |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Tempering valve** | AS 4032.2 | 50 degrees C | Standard residential — baths, showers, basins | Replace every 5 years; test annually |
| **Thermostatic mixing valve (TMV)** | AS 4032.1 / AS/NZS 4032.1 | 45 degrees C (adjustable) | Healthcare, aged care, childcare, disability facilities, or any situation with vulnerable users | Service every 12 months; replace thermostat and O-rings every 5 years |

**Key differences:**
- A tempering valve blends hot and cold water but does NOT have a fail-safe shut-off if the cold water supply fails. It may deliver scalding water if cold supply is interrupted.
- A TMV has a fail-safe mechanism that shuts down or significantly reduces flow if the cold water supply fails, preventing scalding.
- For standard residential renovations, tempering valves are the minimum requirement. TMVs are required only where vulnerable persons are using the facilities.

### 5.3 Tempering Valve Servicing Requirements

| Requirement | Frequency | Standard |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Functional testing (temperature check) | Every 12 months | AS 4032.3:2004 |
| Full replacement (tempering valve is non-serviceable) | Every 5 years maximum | AS 4032.3:2004 |
| TMV thermostat and O-ring replacement | Every 5 years | AS 4032.3:2004 |
| TMV inspection and maintenance | Every 12 months minimum | AS 4032.3:2004 |

**Scope impact:** Every renovation scope involving hot water (which is virtually every renovation) must include a tempering valve line item. Typical scope items:
- "Supply and install tempering valve to bathroom hot water supply (max 50 degrees C delivery)"
- "Supply and install tempering valve to ensuite hot water supply (max 50 degrees C delivery)"
- "Test and verify tempering valve operation — delivery temperature not exceeding 50 degrees C at all personal hygiene outlets"

If an existing tempering valve is more than 5 years old, the scope should include "replace existing tempering valve with new unit — existing valve exceeds 5-year service life."

### 5.4 Hot Water Storage Temperature

| Type | Minimum Storage Temperature | Why |
|------|---------------------------|-----|
| Storage systems (electric, gas, solar with tank, heat pump with tank) | 60 degrees C minimum | Prevent Legionella bacteria growth |
| Instantaneous systems (gas, electric) | N/A — no storage | No Legionella risk as no water is stored |
| Healthcare / aged care facilities | 70 degrees C minimum (with TMV at outlet) | Higher risk population |

**Scope impact:** When a scope includes hot water system replacement or installation, note the required storage temperature: "Hot water system to be set to store water at minimum 60 degrees C in accordance with AS/NZS 3500.4."

### 5.5 Hot Water System Types — Compliance Considerations

| System Type | Key Compliance Points | Scope Notes |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Electric storage** | Store at 60 degrees C+, tempering valve required, minimum energy performance (MEPS) applies | Note location requirements (outdoor or in approved indoor enclosure), tray/tundish for indoor units |
| **Gas storage** | Store at 60 degrees C+, tempering valve required, minimum 5 star gas rating (AS 4552), gas compliance certificate required | Separate gasfitting licence may be required; flue clearances; ventilation requirements |
| **Gas instantaneous** | Tempering valve required if delivery > 50 degrees C, gas compliance certificate required | Flue requirements (may be room-sealed/balanced flue or open flue); external location preferred |
| **Solar (with tank)** | Store at 60 degrees C+, tempering valve required, booster (electric or gas) required | Roof structural adequacy; collector orientation (north-facing preferred); plumber + electrician/gasfitter coordination |
| **Heat pump** | Store at 60 degrees C+, tempering valve required, outdoor installation required (most units) | Noise considerations (setback from boundaries); electrical circuit required (electrician coordination); refrigerant handling may require separate licence |
| **Continuous flow electric** | Tempering valve may not be required if unit delivers at or below 50 degrees C | Dedicated electrical circuit; may require 3-phase power for high-capacity units |

**Scope impact:** The scope should clearly state the type of hot water system and all associated compliance requirements. Where a hot water system is being changed from one type to another (e.g., electric storage to heat pump), the scope must include all decommissioning, disposal, new installation, electrical/gas work, and tempering valve requirements.

### 5.6 Hot Water Pipe Insulation

AS/NZS 3500.4 and energy efficiency provisions require:

- Hot water pipes to be insulated where they pass through non-heated areas (under floors, in roof spaces, through external walls)
- Minimum insulation requirements apply based on pipe size and location
- In some states (particularly Victoria under energy efficiency regulations), all hot water pipes must be insulated

**Scope impact:** Include "insulate all exposed hot water pipework with minimum 13mm closed-cell insulation" as a standard line item in renovation scopes.

---

## 6. AS/NZS 3500.5 — Housing Installations

**Current version:** AS/NZS 3500.5:2021
**Confidence:** HIGH

### 6.1 Scope of Part 5

AS/NZS 3500.5 is specifically for housing installations and applies to:

- Detached dwellings
- Multi-unit dwellings not exceeding three storeys in height
- Communal residential community service buildings with a total floor area not exceeding 300 m2

This part consolidates the requirements from Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 into a single reference specifically for residential work, with some simplified provisions for housing.

### 6.2 Key Residential-Specific Requirements

| Requirement | Detail | Scope Relevance |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Backflow prevention** | Backflow prevention devices required where potable water connects to non-potable systems (irrigation, rainwater tanks, swimming pools) | Budget for backflow device when installing outdoor taps connected to potable supply, or connecting rainwater to house plumbing |
| **Trap seal depth** | Minimum 50 mm, maximum 100 mm | All fixture traps in renovation scope must meet this requirement |
| **Pipe materials** | PVC, copper, or PEX — all must carry WaterMark certification | Specify material in scope; all fittings must also be WaterMark certified |
| **Testing** | 15-minute water test for leaks before wall/floor coverage; air/smoke testing for concealed pipework | Include "pressure test all new pipework before wall close-up" in scope |
| **Drainage grades** | 1:40 (2.5%) for DN 50 pipes, 1:60 (1.65%) for DN 100 pipes | Specify compliant grades in scope |
| **Fixture units** | Toilet = 4 FU, Shower = 2 FU, Basin = 1 FU, Kitchen sink = 1.5 FU, Laundry tub = 2 FU | Used for pipe sizing verification |
| **Vent within 1.5m of trap** | Venting must be provided within 1.5 metres of each trap | Include venting in scope for every new fixture location |
| **Floor waste in wet areas** | Required in bathrooms, laundries, and wet areas with tiled or waterproofed floors | Include floor waste gully in bathroom and laundry renovation scopes |

### 6.3 Simplified Provisions for Housing

AS/NZS 3500.5 provides some simplifications for typical housing installations:

- Simplified pipe sizing tables for common residential layouts
- Reduced documentation requirements compared to commercial installations
- Unvented branch drain provisions for short runs with limited fixture units
- Simplified greywater and rainwater connection provisions

**Scope impact:** For standard residential renovations (single room, 1-2 storey dwelling), AS/NZS 3500.5 is the primary reference. The scope should note "all plumbing work to comply with AS/NZS 3500 series (current edition), with specific reference to Part 5 for housing installations where applicable."

## 7. AS 3740 — Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas (Plumbing Interface)

**Current version:** AS 3740:2021
**Confidence:** HIGH

### 7.1 Where Plumbing and Waterproofing Interact

AS 3740 is primarily the domain of the waterproofing trade, but there are critical interface points where plumbing and waterproofing must coordinate:

| Interface Point | Plumbing Responsibility | Waterproofing Responsibility | Coordination Required |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Floor waste penetration** | Install floor waste gully at correct level | Seal membrane around floor waste using proprietary flange system | Plumber installs floor waste BEFORE waterproofing membrane is applied |
| **Shower base drainage** | Install shower waste at correct level with correct fall | Apply membrane over shower base, seal around waste penetration | Plumber installs waste first; waterproofer applies membrane; plumber does not disturb membrane during fit-off |
| **Pipe penetrations through floor** | Install waste pipes, water supply pipes through floor | Seal all pipe penetrations through waterproof membrane | All pipe penetrations must be identified and in place before waterproofing |
| **Pipe penetrations through walls** | Install hot/cold supply pipes through walls for taps, mixers | Seal all pipe penetrations through water-resistant barriers on walls | Rough-in pipe positions must be finalised before waterproofing |
| **Shower screen location** | N/A | Waterproofing extends to full height behind shower screen and 150mm beyond | Plumber and tiler must coordinate shower screen position |
| **Bath/spa waste** | Install bath waste and overflow | Waterproofing under and around bath to floor waste | Bath waste installed before waterproofing; access to be maintained for servicing |
| **Hob/step-down** | Floor waste must be below hob/step-down level | Membrane applied over hob structure | Coordinated levels between plumber and waterproofer |

### 7.2 Key Waterproofing Requirements That Affect Plumbing Scope

| Requirement | Detail | Plumbing Scope Impact |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Shower floor grade** | Continuous fall between 1:80 and 1:50 to floor waste | Plumber must install floor waste at correct level to achieve required fall within finished floor zone |
| **Membrane under all tiled wet area floors** | Waterproof membrane required under all tiled bathroom/laundry floors | All plumbing rough-in (floor waste, waste pipes, water supply penetrations) must be completed BEFORE waterproofing |
| **Shower walls** | Waterproof membrane to 1800mm above finished floor on shower walls (full height is best practice) | Rough-in pipe positions for taps/mixers must be set before waterproofing |
| **No gaps around penetrations** | All pipe penetrations must be sealed with proprietary flange system or sealant | Plumber must use puddle flanges or similar where pipes penetrate waterproof membranes |
| **Basin splash-back** | Water-resistant barrier behind basin, extending 150mm each side and above basin | Water supply pipes for basin taps pass through this barrier — must be sealed |
| **Compatible materials** | All sealants, flanges, and membranes must be compatible | Plumber must use flanges and sealants compatible with the waterproofing system being used |

### 7.3 Critical Sequencing for Plumbing and Waterproofing

The correct sequence is:

1. **Plumbing rough-in** — install all under-floor drainage, waste pipes, water supply pipes, and floor wastes
2. **Plumber tests and inspects** — pressure test water lines, visual inspection of drainage
3. **Substrate preparation** — screeding/falls prepared (may involve plumber verifying levels)
4. **Waterproofing membrane applied** — waterproofer applies membrane over prepared substrate and seals around all plumbing penetrations
5. **Waterproofing test** — flood test (minimum 24 hours) to verify membrane integrity
6. **Tiling** — tiler applies tiles over waterproof membrane
7. **Plumbing fit-off** — plumber connects fixtures, taps, mixers, toilet etc. AFTER tiling is complete

**Scope impact:** The plumbing scope must clearly identify two separate visits/stages:
- **Rough-in:** All concealed pipework, drainage, floor wastes — completed before waterproofing
- **Fit-off:** All visible fixtures, taps, mixers, toilet connection — completed after tiling

Any plumbing scope for a wet area renovation that does not separate rough-in and fit-off stages is incomplete and will cause scheduling problems on site.

## 8. Backflow Prevention Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 8.1 What Is Backflow?

Backflow is the unintended flow of water in the reverse direction, which can contaminate the drinking water supply. It occurs through either:

- **Back-siphonage:** Caused by negative pressure in the supply system (e.g., water main break)
- **Back-pressure:** Caused by pressure in the downstream system exceeding supply pressure (e.g., thermal expansion, pumped systems)

### 8.2 Hazard Ratings

AS/NZS 3500.1 and the Plumbing Code of Australia classify cross-connections by hazard level:

| Hazard Level | Definition | Residential Examples |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Low hazard** | Any condition that constitutes a nuisance but does not endanger health or cause injury | Standard residential supply with no cross-connections; hose bib without submerged outlet |
| **Medium hazard** | Any condition that has the potential to endanger health | Swimming pool fill connection; recycled/greywater connection; some irrigation systems |
| **High hazard** | Any condition that has the potential to cause death | Connection to sewage system; chemical mixing; bidets with submerged outlet; handheld bidet sprays |

### 8.3 Device Types and Requirements

| Hazard Level | Device Required | Testable? | Annual Testing? | Typical Residential Application |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Low hazard** | Non-testable dual check valve (DCV) | No | No | Standard residential water meter; hose taps (basic) |
| **Medium hazard** | Testable double check valve (DCDA) | Yes | Yes | Swimming pool autofill; irrigation with chemical injection; rainwater tank connection |
| **High hazard** | Reduced Pressure Zone Device (RPZD) | Yes | Yes | Bidets with submerged outlet; handheld bidet sprays; connection to any system containing hazardous substances |

### 8.4 When Backflow Devices Are Required in Residential Renovations

| Scenario | Device Required | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Standard residential connection (no special hazards) | Non-testable dual check valve at meter | Usually already installed by water authority |
| New outdoor hose tap connected to potable supply | Hose connection vacuum breaker (HCVB) at the tap | Prevents backflow through hose submerged in pool, bucket, etc. |
| Swimming pool/spa autofill | Testable device (minimum medium hazard) | Water authority may have specific requirements |
| Irrigation system connected to potable supply | Depends on hazard — minimum HCVB at tap; if chemical injection, then RPZD | Higher hazard if fertiliser/pesticide injection is possible |
| Rainwater tank connected to potable supply (top-up) | Air gap or testable device depending on configuration | Must prevent cross-contamination between rainwater and potable supply |
| Bidet douche seat (submerged outlet) | Individual high hazard device at each outlet | AS/NZS 3500.1 and PCA requirement |
| Handheld bidet spray | Individual high hazard device at each outlet | Must receive drinking water supply only |
| Dishwasher/washing machine | Air gap on waste connection (not on supply) | Prevents waste water flowing back into supply |

### 8.5 The 2025 Standard Change — Atmospheric Vacuum Breakers

The 2025 update to AS/NZS 3500.1 elevated Atmospheric Vacuum Breakers (AVBs) to high hazard testable devices (previously they were considered suitable for lower hazard levels). This means:

- AVBs are now subject to annual testing requirements
- Some existing installations using AVBs may need to be reassessed
- Plumbers must be aware of this reclassification when specifying backflow prevention

**Scope impact:** For any renovation where outdoor taps, irrigation systems, swimming pool connections, or bidet installations are included, the scope must include the appropriate backflow prevention device. Common scope line items:
- "Supply and install hose connection vacuum breaker to each new outdoor hose tap"
- "Supply and install testable double check valve to swimming pool autofill connection — annual testing required"
- "Supply and install RPZD to bidet spray connection — annual testing required"
- "Budget for backflow device if installing outdoor tap connected to potable supply"

## 9. State-by-State Licensing Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from official government licensing bodies)

### 9.1 Overview

Plumbing is one of only two trades in Australia (alongside electrical) that requires mandatory licensing in every state and territory. A plumber must hold a current licence in the state where they perform the work. While mutual recognition arrangements exist between states, there are differences in licence categories, classes, and administrative requirements.

### 9.2 State-by-State Licensing Table

| State/Territory | Licensing Body | Key Licence Categories | Gasfitting Covered? | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|----|
| **NSW** | NSW Fair Trading (Building Commission NSW from 2026) | Tradesperson Certificate; Qualified Supervisor Certificate; Endorsed Contractor Licence. Categories: Water plumbing, Sewerage/sanitary, Draining, Roof plumbing, Mechanical services, Gasfitting (Type A, B, C) | Yes — separate gasfitting categories within same licensing system | Licence available for 1, 3, or 5 years. Must be licensed in each specific category of work |
| **VIC** | Victorian Building Authority (VBA) | Registration (work under supervision) and Licence (work independently, issue compliance certificates). Main classes: Water supply, Sanitary, Drainage, Gasfitting, Roofing (stormwater), Mechanical services, Irrigation. Specialised classes: Backflow prevention, TMV work, Type A servicing, Type A conversion | Yes — gasfitting is a main class under VBA. Type B gas requires separate specialised class | Only LICENSED plumbers can issue compliance certificates. Registered plumbers work under supervision of licensed plumber |
| **QLD** | Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) | Contractor licence; Nominee supervisor; Site supervisor; Occupational licence (plumber, drainer, restricted). Restricted classes: Water plumber, Drainer, Gas (restricted water plumber — gas). Three work categories: Permit work, Notifiable work, Minor work | Gasfitting licence issued separately by Chief Gas Examiner / Resources Safety and Health Queensland | To do gas work, must hold BOTH QBCC plumbing licence AND separate gasfitting licence from Chief Gas Examiner |
| **SA** | Consumer and Business Services (CBS); Office of the Technical Regulator (OTR) | Workers Registration (do the physical work); Contractors Licence (run the business). Governed by Plumbers, Gas Fitters and Electricians Act 1995 | Separate — gas fitting is a distinct registration/licence category under same Act | Gas fitting and plumbing are separate registrations but administered by same body. eCoC (electronic Certificate of Compliance) system |
| **WA** | Plumbers Licensing Board (PLB) administered by Building and Energy, DEMIRS | Tradesperson's Licence; Tradesperson's Licence (Drainage Plumbing); Provisional Tradesperson's Licence; Plumbing Contractor's Licence; Permits (for limited work) | Gas fitting is separate — regulated by EnergySafety WA | Five licence types. Gas fitting requires separate licence from WA EnergySafety. 3-year licence period |
| **TAS** | Consumer, Building and Occupational Services (CBOS) | Practitioner Licence (WSDR — Water, Sanitary, Drainage, Roof/Stormwater); Contractor Licence. Work categories: Low Risk, Notifiable, Permit Work (per Director's Determination) | Gas fitting is a separate licence under CBOS | Gas-fitting practitioner and contractor licences are separate from plumbing licences. Both administered by CBOS |
| **NT** | Plumbers and Drainers Licensing Board | Advanced Tradesman Licence; Journeyman Licence. Two regulated categories only: Plumbing and Draining. Roof plumbing and mechanical services NOT regulated | Gas fitting is separate — regulated by NT WorkSafe under Dangerous Goods Regulations | Licence period: 3 years. Minimum 2 years post-trade experience plus 10 units of competency required |
| **ACT** | Access Canberra (under Construction Occupations (Licensing) Act 2004) | Individual Plumber licence; Drainer licence; Gasfitter licence. Multiple classes within each licence type with different scopes of work | Gasfitter is a separate licence category but administered through same system (Access Canberra) | Gas work governed by Gas Safety Act 2000. ACT banned new gas connections in new buildings from 8 December 2023 |

### 9.3 Automatic Mutual Recognition (AMR)

Since 1 July 2022, Australia has implemented Automatic Mutual Recognition for occupational licences. This means:

- A plumber licensed in one state can generally work in another state under their home-state licence
- They must notify the host jurisdiction before commencing work
- They must comply with the host state's laws and standards
- Some conditions and restrictions may apply
- AMR does NOT apply to all licence types — check specific requirements

**Scope impact:** For the AI generating scopes, the critical implication is:
1. The scope must note that all plumbing work must be carried out by a plumber licensed in the relevant state
2. For gas work, the scope must note the additional gasfitting licence requirement
3. The scope should state: "All plumbing work to be carried out by a licensed plumber holding appropriate licence(s) for the state/territory in which the work is being performed"
4. For gas work: "All gas fitting work to be carried out by a licensed gasfitter holding appropriate licence(s) for the state/territory"

---

## 10. Certificate of Compliance — State-by-State

**Confidence:** HIGH

A Certificate of Compliance (CoC) is a legal document that must be issued by the plumber after completing plumbing work, certifying that the work complies with the relevant standards and regulations.

### 10.1 State-by-State Compliance Certificate Requirements

Notifiable Work: plumber notifies council minimum 2 days before each mandatory inspection stage. Permit Work: council permit required before starting |
| **NT** | Certificate of Compliance | Licensed plumber | All regulated plumbing work | Upon completion | Plumbers and Drainers Licensing Board | Notification requirements apply; inspection may be required for drainage work |
| **ACT** | Certificate of Compliance | Licensed plumber/drainer/gasfitter | All licensed plumbing, draining, and gas work | Upon completion | Access Canberra | Notification and inspection requirements apply depending on work type and risk level |

### 10.2 Key Takeaways for Scope Documents

**Scope impact:** Every plumbing scope must include a note that the plumber will provide:
1. A Certificate of Compliance (or equivalent) upon completion of work
2. A Sewer Service Diagram (where drainage work is included)
3. All required notification to the relevant authority before commencing work

Typical scope note: "Upon completion, the plumber shall provide the homeowner with a Certificate of Compliance for all work performed, and lodge copies with the relevant plumbing authority in accordance with state requirements. Where drainage work is included, a Sewer Service Diagram shall be provided."

## 13. Gas Fitting — Licensing and Compliance

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 13.1 Is Gas Work Covered Under Plumbing Licence?

**Short answer: It depends on the state, but in most states gas fitting requires a SEPARATE licence or additional endorsement.**

| State/Territory | Gas Fitting Licence Separate from Plumbing? | Additional Licensing Body | Detail |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **NSW** | Same licensing system but separate categories | NSW Fair Trading | Gasfitting is a separate category (Type A, Type B, Type C) within the plumbing licensing system. You must hold the specific gasfitting category on your licence |
| **VIC** | Same licensing system but separate class | VBA | Gasfitting is a main class under VBA. Must hold gasfitting registration/licence. Type B gas requires specialised class. Energy Safe Victoria oversees gas safety compliance |
| **QLD** | Separate licence required | Chief Gas Examiner / Resources Safety and Health Queensland | QBCC issues plumbing licence, but gasfitting licence comes from the Chief Gas Examiner. Must hold BOTH to do gas work |
| **SA** | Separate registration | Consumer and Business Services (CBS) | Gas fitting is a distinct registration under the Plumbers, Gas Fitters and Electricians Act 1995 |
| **WA** | Separate licence | EnergySafety WA | Gas fitting licence separate from plumbing licence; different regulatory body |
| **TAS** | Separate licence | CBOS | Gas-fitting practitioner and contractor licences separate from plumbing licences |
| **NT** | Separate licence | NT WorkSafe (Dangerous Goods Regulations) | Gas fitting regulated under Dangerous Goods, not plumbing |
| **ACT** | Separate licence category | Access Canberra (Gas Safety Act 2000) | Gasfitter licence separate from plumber licence, but both issued by Access Canberra |

### 13.2 Type A vs Type B Gas Appliances

| Category | Definition | Examples | Who Can Work On Them |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Type A** | Domestic and light commercial appliances; mass-produced; certification scheme exists | Gas cooktops, gas ovens, gas water heaters (storage and instantaneous), gas space heaters, gas ducted heating, gas fireplaces, gas BBQs (fixed) | Licensed gasfitter with Type A endorsement |
| **Type B** | Appliances with gas consumption >10 MJ/hour for which no certification scheme exists; typically large commercial/industrial | Commercial kitchen equipment, industrial boilers, large commercial water heaters | Requires Type B gasfitting licence; more stringent requirements |

For residential renovations, virtually all gas work involves Type A appliances.

### 13.3 Gas Compliance Certificates

| State | Certificate Name | When Required | Submitted To | Timeline |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **NSW** | Certificate of Compliance (gas); Certificate of Inspection (gas — not connected to network) | All gasfitting work on connected or unconnected gas installations | Building Commission NSW (transitioning to BCNSW eCert portal from March 2026) | Within 5 business days of completing work |

| Service gas appliance | Yes (gas servicing endorsement in VIC) | Depends on state | Annual servicing recommended |
| Install gas line for BBQ | Yes | Yes | Even for outdoor fixed BBQ installations |

### 13.5 Victoria Gas Ban — Impact on Plumbing Scopes

From 1 January 2024, new homes in Victoria requiring a planning permit cannot connect to the gas network. Key implications:

| Rule | Detail | Scope Impact |
|------|--------|-------------|
| New homes (planning permit required) from Jan 2024 | No gas connections allowed | All new home scopes must be all-electric |
| New homes (no planning permit, e.g., knockdown rebuild on existing subdivision) from Jan 2027 | No gas connections allowed | Broader ban from 2027 |
| Existing homes — renovation | Gas connections still permitted | Renovation scopes CAN include gas work in existing homes |
| Existing homes — hot water replacement at end of life | Must be replaced with efficient electric alternative | If existing gas HWS fails and needs full replacement (not repair), must go electric (heat pump or solar electric) |
| LPG (bottled gas) | Unaffected by the ban | LPG appliances still permitted in all scenarios |

### 13.6 ACT Gas Ban

From 8 December 2023, new gas network connections are prohibited in the ACT for residential buildings, commercial land-use zones, and community facility zones. Transitional arrangements applied for development applications lodged and building approvals issued by 1 March 2024.

**Scope impact:** For renovation scopes in Victoria and the ACT:
- Existing homes can still have gas work in scopes
- If replacing an end-of-life gas hot water system in VIC, the scope should recommend heat pump or electric alternatives
- New builds in VIC and ACT must be all-electric — no gas line items
- LPG (bottled gas) is exempt from both bans

| **Kitchen sink delivery** | No maximum specified | — | Kitchen sinks are not "personal hygiene" fixtures; tempering valve not required (but may be installed) |
| **Laundry tub delivery** | No maximum specified | — | Laundry tubs are not "personal hygiene" fixtures; tempering valve not required |

### 14.2 Energy Efficiency Requirements Affecting Hot Water Choices

| System Type | Energy Efficiency Requirement | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| **Gas storage** | Minimum 5 star energy rating per AS 4552 | Higher star rating = lower gas consumption |
| **Gas instantaneous** | Subject to energy rating requirements | Generally more efficient than gas storage |
| **Electric storage** | Subject to Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) under Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012 | Electric resistance storage is the least efficient option; being phased out in some jurisdictions |
| **Heat pump** | Not subject to MEPS but eligible for Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) | Highly efficient — use approximately 30% of energy of conventional electric storage |
| **Solar (with electric or gas boost)** | Eligible for STCs; must comply with AS/NZS 4234 | Collector orientation and size requirements |
| **Electric instantaneous** | Subject to energy rating requirements | May require 3-phase power for high-capacity units |

### 14.3 State-Specific Hot Water Regulations

| State | Specific Requirements |
|-------|---------------------|
| **NSW** | BASIX certificate required for new buildings and some alterations/additions. BASIX sets minimum energy and water performance targets that may influence hot water system choice. Electric resistance storage hot water not permitted in new Class 1 buildings in many climate zones |
| **VIC** | Gas ban: end-of-life gas hot water systems in existing homes must be replaced with efficient electric alternative (not applicable to repairs). Government rebates available for heat pump installation through Victorian Energy Upgrades (VEU) program. Free training for 1,000 plumbers to install heat pumps |
| **QLD** | Queensland Development Code requirements; no gas ban as of February 2026 |
| **SA** | No specific gas ban; OTR administers compliance |
| **WA** | No specific gas ban; different climate considerations (warm climate makes solar HW effective) |
| **TAS** | No specific gas ban; colder climate means heat pump sizing is critical |
| **NT** | No specific gas ban; hot climate reduces hot water energy demand |
| **ACT** | Gas ban on new connections from December 2023. Existing homes may retain gas. Government incentives for electrification |

### 14.4 Hot Water System Replacement Requirements

When an existing hot water system is being replaced during a renovation, the plumber must consider:

| Consideration | Requirement |
|--------------|------------|
| **Tempering valve** | Must be installed/verified — if existing valve is >5 years old, replace |
| **Pressure/temperature relief valve (PTR)** | Must be installed on all storage systems; must discharge to a safe location (tundish or external drain) |
| **Expansion control valve** | Required where a pressure-limiting valve or check valve is installed on the cold water inlet |
| **Cold water isolation valve** | Required on inlet to hot water system |
| **Hot water system location** | Must comply with manufacturer's installation requirements and local regulations |
| **Indoor installation** | If installed indoors, must be on a tray/tundish draining to an approved drain to contain leaks |
| **Energy efficiency** | Check state requirements — some states restrict installation of electric resistance storage in new buildings |
| **Gas compliance** | If gas system: gas compliance certificate required; gas line must be tested |
| **Electrical** | Electric systems require dedicated electrical circuit — coordinate with electrician |

**Scope impact:** A hot water system replacement scope should include ALL of the above items. A complete scope line item set for hot water replacement looks like:

1. "Disconnect and remove existing [type] hot water system — dispose of responsibly"
2. "Supply and install new [type, brand, model, capacity] hot water system at [location]"
3. "Supply and install tempering valve to all bathroom/ensuite hot water supplies (max 50 degrees C delivery)"
4. "Supply and install pressure/temperature relief valve with discharge to [tundish/external drain]"
5. "Supply and install expansion control valve on cold water inlet (if required)"
6. "Supply and install cold water isolation valve"
7. "Test and commission — verify storage temperature 60 degrees C+, delivery temperature max 50 degrees C at personal hygiene outlets"
8. "Provide Certificate of Compliance"
9. If gas: "Gas fitting work — supply, install, and test gas connection; provide gas compliance certificate"
10. If electric: "Coordinate with electrician for dedicated electrical circuit" (separate electrical scope)

## 15. Water Efficiency (WELS)

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 15.1 What Is WELS?

The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards (WELS) scheme is a mandatory Australian program that requires registration and water efficiency labelling of certain water-using and water-saving products before they can be sold in Australia. It is governed by the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2005 and the Australian Standard AS/NZS 6400:2016.

### 15.2 Products Covered by WELS

| Product Category | WELS Rated? | Star Rating Range | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Toilets (WCs) | Yes | 0 to 6 stars | Dual flush is standard in Australia; 4-star is now common (3L/4.5L or 3L/3L) |
| Showerheads | Yes | 0 to 3 stars | Maximum 3 stars (9 L/min); 3-star is the PCA minimum for new installations |
| Taps (basin, kitchen, bath) | Yes | 0 to 6 stars | Flow rate in litres per minute; aerated taps can achieve high ratings |
| Urinals | Yes | 0 to 6 stars | Rarely relevant for residential, but included for completeness |
| Clothes washing machines | Yes | 0 to 6 stars | Not typically a plumbing scope item, but relevant for laundry connections |
| Dishwashers | Yes | 0 to 6 stars | Not typically a plumbing scope item, but relevant for kitchen connections |
| Flow controllers | Yes | — | Devices that restrict flow; can be added to non-WELS taps |

### 15.3 Minimum WELS Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Source | Applies To |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) minimum — showerheads** | 3 stars (max 9 L/min) | PCA / NCC Volume 3 | All new installations nationally |
| **Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) minimum — taps** | 3 stars | PCA / NCC Volume 3 | All new installations nationally |
| **Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) minimum — toilets** | 3 stars (dual flush) | PCA / NCC Volume 3 | All new installations nationally |
| **NSW BASIX — alterations/additions** | 3 stars minimum for all new taps, toilets, and showerheads | BASIX | Applies to alterations and additions in NSW that trigger a BASIX certificate |
| **VIC — 6-star energy requirement** | May influence fixture selection | NCC energy provisions | New buildings in VIC |

**Market reality:** As of 2026, the vast majority of fixtures available in Australia already meet or exceed the 3-star minimum:
- Over 93% of toilets available are 4-star or greater
- Over 92% of taps available are 4-star or greater
- 3-star is the maximum possible rating for showerheads (9 L/min)

### 15.4 WELS Star Ratings — What They Mean in Practice

**Showerheads:**

| Star Rating | Maximum Flow Rate | Practical Note |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| 0 stars | > 16 L/min | Non-compliant for new installations |
| 1 star | > 12 L/min, <= 16 L/min | Non-compliant for new installations |
| 2 stars | > 9 L/min, <= 12 L/min | Non-compliant for new installations |
| 3 stars | <= 9 L/min | Minimum requirement; standard for all new installations |

**Toilets (dual flush):**

| Star Rating | Full Flush / Half Flush | Practical Note |
|------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 3 stars | 6L / 3L (or 4.5L / 3L) | Minimum requirement |
| 4 stars | 4.5L / 3L (or 3L / 3L) | Most common; good balance of efficiency and function |
| 5-6 stars | 3L / 1.5L or less | Ultra-efficient; becoming more available |

**Taps:**

| Star Rating | Maximum Flow Rate | Practical Note |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| 0-2 stars | > 7.5 L/min | Non-compliant for new installations |
| 3 stars | <= 7.5 L/min | Minimum requirement |
| 4 stars | <= 6 L/min | Common for quality fixtures |
| 5-6 stars | <= 4.5 L/min or less | Premium water-efficient fixtures |

### 15.5 State-Specific Water Efficiency Requirements

| State | Additional Requirements |
|-------|----------------------|
| **NSW** | BASIX (Building Sustainability Index) certificate required for new buildings, swimming pools, and some alterations/additions. Sets water reduction targets that influence fixture selection. For alterations/additions, minimum 3-star WELS for all new fixtures. Some councils have additional rainwater tank requirements |
| **VIC** | Victorian plumbing regulations align with PCA minimums. Sustainability Victoria promotes water efficiency. Some local water utilities offer rebates for high-WELS-rated fixtures |
| **QLD** | Queensland Development Code MP 4.1 — sustainable buildings requirements. Drought-prone areas may have additional water restrictions affecting fixture choices |
| **SA** | Water-proofing requirements under SA Water's guidelines. SA has historically had water restrictions influencing fixture specification |
| **WA** | Water Corporation has strong water efficiency programs. Some councils require rainwater tanks for new builds. Waterwise labelling program complements WELS |
| **TAS** | TasWater aligns with national WELS requirements |
| **NT** | Power and Water Corporation aligns with national WELS requirements |
| **ACT** | Icon Water and ACT government align with WELS; additional sustainability requirements may apply |

**Scope impact:** Every renovation scope that includes new fixtures should reference WELS compliance:
- "All new fixtures to be minimum 3-star WELS rated (or higher where specified)"
- "Supply and install [brand/model] showerhead — WELS 3-star rated (9 L/min maximum)"
- "Supply and install [brand/model] dual-flush toilet — WELS 4-star rated (4.5L/3L)"
- "Supply and install [brand/model] basin mixer — WELS [X]-star rated"

Where the homeowner is selecting their own fixtures (common in renovations), the scope should note: "All homeowner-supplied fixtures must be minimum 3-star WELS rated and WaterMark certified. Plumber reserves the right to refuse installation of non-compliant fixtures."

## APPENDIX C: Detailed State Licensing — Scope of Work Permitted

**Confidence:** HIGH

This appendix provides additional detail on what work is permitted under each licence level in the most commonly encountered states, to help the AI correctly specify licensing requirements in scope documents.

### NSW Plumbing Licence Categories (Schedule 4, Home Building Regulation 2014)

| Category | Description | Typical Renovation Work Covered |
|----------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Water plumbing** | Installation, alteration, repair, maintenance of water plumbing (not drainage) | Hot and cold water supply pipework, tap installation, water heater connections, tempering valves, backflow prevention |
| **Sewerage and sanitary plumbing** | Installation, alteration, repair of sanitary plumbing within a building and to the building's external drainage system | Waste pipes from fixtures, internal drainage, stack work, trap installation |
| **Draining** | Installation, alteration, repair of sanitary drainage external to the building to the point of connection to the sewer | External drainage, sewer connections, inspection shafts, overflow relief gullies |
| **Roof plumbing** | Installation, alteration, repair of roof plumbing including gutters, downpipes, roof flashings, stormwater drainage | Gutters, downpipes, stormwater connections (not typically part of interior renovation scope) |
| **Mechanical services plumbing** | Installation, alteration, repair of mechanical heating, cooling, and ventilation systems | Split system drainage, evaporative cooler plumbing connections |
| **Type A gasfitting** | Installation, servicing of Type A gas appliances (domestic/light commercial) | Gas cooktop connection, gas HW installation, gas bayonet points, gas heater connection |
| **Type B gasfitting** | Installation of Type B gas appliances (large commercial/industrial) | Rarely relevant to residential renovation |
| **Type C gasfitting** | LPG systems including cylinders and piping | LPG bottle installation, LPG piping to appliances (relevant in non-natural-gas areas) |

**Key point for scopes:** A plumber holding a "water plumbing" category cannot legally do drainage work. A drainer cannot do water plumbing. Most residential renovation plumbers hold multiple categories, but the scope should note the requirement for both water plumbing and draining where applicable.

### Victoria Plumbing Classes (VBA)

| Main Class | Scope of Work | Relevant to Renovation Scopes? |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Water supply** | Cold and heated water supply pipework, valves, devices | Yes — all water supply work |
| **Sanitary** | Waste pipes, fixture connections, traps, stacks within building | Yes — all internal waste/drainage |
| **Drainage** | Below-ground sanitary drainage from building to sewer connection | Yes — all underground drainage |
| **Gasfitting** | Consumer gas piping and Type A gas appliance installation | Yes — all gas appliance connections |
| **Roofing (stormwater)** | Roof drainage, gutters, downpipes, stormwater | Rarely for interior renovations |
| **Mechanical services** | HVAC plumbing connections | Occasionally for split system drainage |
| **Irrigation (non-agricultural)** | Garden irrigation systems | Only if irrigation included in outdoor scope |

| Specialised Class | Parent Class | Scope of Work |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Backflow prevention** | Water supply | Installation, testing, and maintenance of backflow prevention devices |
| **TMV work** | Water supply | Installation and servicing of thermostatic mixing valves |
| **Type A appliance conversion** | Gasfitting | Converting gas appliances from one fuel type to another |
| **Type A appliance servicing** | Gasfitting | Routine servicing and CO testing of Type A gas appliances |

**Key point for scopes:** In Victoria, only a LICENSED plumber (not just registered) can issue a compliance certificate. The scope must ensure the plumber assigned to the job is licensed, not merely registered.

### Queensland Work Categories in Detail

| Category | Definition | Examples | Approval Required |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Permit Work** | Work requiring a local government permit before commencing | New drainage connections, significant drainage alterations, on-site sewerage facilities, stormwater drainage work | Apply to local government (Form 1); inspections required; local government issues compliance |
| **Notifiable Work** | Work that must be registered with QBCC after completion | Kitchen and bathroom renovation plumbing (fixture additions/relocations), hot water system replacement, installing new fixtures where locations change | No permit needed before starting; register with QBCC within 10 business days of invoicing (Form 4/4a) |
| **Minor Work** | Work that does not require permits or notification | Like-for-like replacement of taps, showerheads, tap washers, toilet cistern components, replacing existing water heater in same location with same type | No documentation required beyond standard trade practices |

**Key point for scopes:** Most residential renovation plumbing in Queensland falls into the "Notifiable Work" category. The scope should note: "This work is classified as Notifiable Work under Queensland regulations. The plumber will register the work with QBCC within 10 business days of completion."

### WA Notice System in Detail

| Document | When Required | Submitted To | Timeline |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Notice of Intention (NoI)** | Before commencing any major plumbing work | Plumbers Licensing Board via eNotice | Must be lodged BEFORE work commences |
| **Inspection notification (drainage)** | When drainage work is complete, tested, and ready for inspection | Plumbers Licensing Board | Before backfilling; Board schedules inspection |
| **Certificate of Compliance** | Upon completion of all work | Plumbers Licensing Board via eNotice | Within 5 working days of completion |
| **Drainage plumbing diagram** | When drainage work is included | Submitted with Certificate of Compliance | Submitted with CoC |
| **Copy to owner** | Always | Property owner/occupier | At completion |
| **Copy to local government (non-sewered)** | Drainage work in non-sewered areas | Local government authority | At completion |

## APPENDIX D: Common Renovation Scenarios — Compliance Decision Tree

**Confidence:** HIGH

This appendix provides decision-tree guidance for common renovation scenarios to help the AI determine which compliance requirements apply.

### Scenario 1: Bathroom Renovation — Same Fixture Locations

**Description:** Existing bathroom stripped back to framing; all fixtures reinstalled in same locations.

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance | Yes | Plumbing work is being done on fixtures and pipework |
| Sewer Service Diagram | Only if drainage is altered (e.g., replacing old cast iron with new PVC) | If drainage pipe material changes but locations stay same, still submit SSD in most states |
| Drainage inspection | Only if below-ground drainage is altered | If only above-ground waste pipes are replaced, no drainage inspection in most states |
| Notice of Work | Yes (in most states) | Any plumbing work beyond minor maintenance requires notification |
| Tempering valve | Yes — verify existing or install new | Must confirm max 50 degrees C delivery at all personal hygiene outlets |
| Backflow prevention | Only if bidet or special fixtures added | Standard fixtures do not trigger additional backflow requirements |
| WELS compliance | Yes — all new fixtures must be minimum 3-star | Even if "same location," new fixtures must comply |
| WaterMark compliance | Yes — all new materials must be WaterMark certified | All new pipes, fittings, valves, fixtures |

### Scenario 2: Bathroom Renovation — Fixtures Relocated

**Description:** Bathroom layout changes — toilet, shower, and/or basin moved to new positions.

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance | Yes | Significant plumbing work |
| Sewer Service Diagram | Yes | Drainage layout has changed |
| Drainage inspection | Yes (in most states) | Below-ground drainage being altered |
| Notice of Work | Yes | Must be submitted before commencing work |
| Venting assessment | Yes | New fixture positions may require additional venting |
| Tempering valve | Yes | Install new or verify existing |
| Below-slab work | Likely yes | Relocating toilet almost always requires cutting and relaying drainage under concrete slab |
| Structural assessment | Possibly | Cutting concrete slab may require structural engineer assessment |
| Waterproofing coordination | Yes | New pipe penetration positions require waterproofing coordination |

**Cost alert for scope:** Fixture relocation on a concrete slab is significantly more expensive than same-location replacement. The scope should clearly note "allow for concrete cutting and reinstatement for drainage relocation" as a separate line item, typically $2,000-$8,000 depending on extent.

### Scenario 3: Kitchen Renovation — Sink Relocated

**Description:** Kitchen renovated with sink moved to a different position (e.g., from against a wall to a kitchen island).

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance | Yes | Plumbing work on water supply and drainage |
| Sewer Service Diagram | Yes (if drainage altered) | Waste pipe routing has changed |
| Drainage inspection | Possibly | Depends on whether below-ground drainage is affected |
| Venting | Critical consideration | Island sink may be remote from vent stack; AAV or dedicated vent pipe may be required |
| Water supply extension | Yes | New hot and cold supply pipework to island location |
| Dishwasher relocation | Possibly | If dishwasher moves with sink, water supply and waste connections relocate |
| Gas point relocation | Possibly | If cooktop moves, gas point may need to relocate (separate gasfitting scope) |

**Key issue for scope:** Kitchen island sink installations are one of the most venting-challenging scenarios in residential plumbing. The scope must address how venting will be achieved — typically via an AAV installed in the island cabinetry (must be accessible) or a dedicated vent pipe run through the floor and up through the building to roof level.

### Scenario 4: Hot Water System Replacement — Like for Like

**Description:** Existing hot water system has failed and is being replaced with the same type.

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance | Yes | Plumbing work |
| Tempering valve | Yes — check existing; replace if >5 years old | Must verify or replace |
| PTR valve | Yes — new unit; new PTR valve | Pressure/temperature relief valve standard with new HW unit |
| Gas compliance (if gas unit) | Yes | Gas connection requires gas compliance certificate |
| Electrical (if electric unit) | Coordinate with electrician | Electrician to disconnect/reconnect; electrical compliance certificate from electrician |
| Notification | Yes (most states) | Even like-for-like HW replacement is notifiable work |
| VIC gas ban check | Yes if in Victoria | If existing gas HW has reached end of life, must replace with efficient electric alternative |

### Scenario 5: Hot Water System Upgrade — Gas to Heat Pump

**Description:** Homeowner converting from gas storage hot water to electric heat pump.

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance (plumbing) | Yes | Significant plumbing work — disconnecting gas, installing heat pump water connections |
| Gas compliance (disconnection) | Yes | Gas supply must be properly disconnected and capped by licensed gasfitter |
| Electrical compliance | Yes | Heat pump requires dedicated electrical circuit — electrician |
| Tempering valve | Yes | Install new or verify existing |
| Hot water pipe modifications | Possibly | Heat pump may be in different location; pipework may need rerouting |
| Noise assessment | Recommended | Heat pump external unit must comply with EPA noise guidelines; setback from boundaries |
| Disposal of old unit | Include in scope | Responsible disposal of old gas storage HW tank |
| STC credits | Inform homeowner | Heat pump may be eligible for Small-scale Technology Certificates (government rebate) |
| VIC VEU rebate | Inform homeowner (VIC only) | Victorian Energy Upgrades program may provide rebate |

### Scenario 6: Adding an Outdoor Tap

**Description:** Homeowner wants a new outdoor garden hose tap added.

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance | Yes (in most states for new fixture) | New water outlet being added |
| Backflow prevention | Yes — hose connection vacuum breaker (HCVB) | Garden hoses are a cross-connection risk (hose end can be submerged) |
| Pipe sizing verification | Yes | Verify existing supply can handle additional outlet |
| Isolation valve | Yes | Install isolation valve for new tap |
| WaterMark tap | Yes | Outdoor tap must be WaterMark certified |
| Frost protection | Consider in cold climates (e.g., ACT, TAS, highland areas) | May need frost-proof tap or insulation |

### Scenario 7: Laundry Renovation — Adding Second Tub or Relocating Washing Machine

**Description:** Laundry being renovated with washing machine taps relocated or second laundry tub added.

| Compliance Item | Required? | Why |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| Certificate of Compliance | Yes | Plumbing work |
| Water hammer arrestors | Yes — at washing machine taps | Solenoid valves in washing machines cause water hammer |
| Floor waste | Yes — if tiled floor | Required in laundry wet areas |
| Overflow protection | Consider | Washing machine overflow protection (tray or raised lip) |
| Drainage capacity | Verify | Adding second tub increases drainage load; verify existing drain size adequate |
| Tempering valve | Not required for laundry tub | Laundry is not a "personal hygiene" fixture |

## APPENDIX E: Plumbing Terminology — Australian vs International

**Confidence:** HIGH

This appendix clarifies Australian plumbing terminology that may differ from other countries, ensuring the AI uses correct Australian terms in scope documents.

| Australian Term | What It Means | International Equivalent | Do NOT Use |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Tap** | A valve that controls water flow at a fixture | Faucet (US) | "Faucet" — not used in Australia |
| **Mixer** | A single tap that blends hot and cold water | Mixer faucet / mixing faucet | — |
| **Basin** | A washbasin in a bathroom (for hand/face washing) | Sink / lavatory (US) | "Lavatory" — not commonly used in Australia for basins |
| **Sink** | A kitchen or laundry sink (for washing dishes/clothes) | Sink | — |
| **Tub** / **Laundry tub** | A laundry sink / washtub | Utility sink / laundry sink | "Utility sink" — not used in Australia |
| **Bath** | A bathtub | Bathtub / tub (US) | — |
| **WC** / **Toilet** | Water closet / toilet | Toilet | "Commode" — not used in Australia |
| **Cistern** | The water tank behind/above the toilet | Toilet tank (US) | — |
| **GPO** | General purpose outlet (power point) | Outlet / receptacle | Used in electrical context, included here for cross-trade reference |
| **Floor waste** | A drain grate set into a tiled floor | Floor drain | — |
| **Gully** | A fitting with a grate that receives waste water (e.g., overflow relief gully) | Floor drain / area drain | — |
| **ORG** | Overflow relief gully | — | Unique Australian term |
| **Inspection opening (IO)** | A capped access point in a drain pipe | Cleanout (US) | "Cleanout" — acceptable but "IO" is the standard Australian term |
| **Inspection shaft (IS)** | A vertical access shaft to underground drains | Manhole (general) | "Manhole" — acceptable for larger shafts but IS is preferred |
| **Boundary trap** | A trap located at the property boundary connecting private drain to public sewer | — | State-specific: used in some states (e.g., VIC, SA) but not all |
| **Hose cock** / **Hose tap** | An outdoor tap for garden hose connection | Hose bib / sillcock (US) | "Hose bib" — not used in Australia |
| **Stopcock** | An isolation valve (usually the main valve at the meter) | Shut-off valve / isolation valve | All terms acceptable; "stopcock" is traditional Australian |
| **Tundish** | A funnel-shaped fitting that provides a visible air gap for discharge from PTR valves | — | Australian-specific plumbing term |
| **PTR valve** | Pressure and temperature relief valve on hot water systems | T&P valve (US) | "T&P valve" — not standard in Australia |
| **Sewer service diagram (SSD)** | Drawing showing private drainage layout on a property | As-built drawing / record drawing | "SSD" is the specific NSW term; other states may use different names |
| **Tradie** | A tradesperson | Tradesman / contractor | Colloquial but universally understood in Australia |
| **Rough-in** | First fix — concealed pipework stage | First fix (UK) / rough-in (US) | Both "rough-in" and "first fix" used in Australia |
| **Fit-off** | Second fix — connecting visible fixtures after coverings applied | Second fix (UK) / trim-out (US) | "Fit-off" is standard Australian; "second fix" also used |

**Scope impact:** The AI must use Australian terminology throughout every scope document. Using American terms like "faucet," "hose bib," or "T&P valve" will immediately undermine the professional credibility of the scope and confuse Australian tradies. Always use: tap, hose tap, PTR valve, basin (not sink for bathroom), floor waste (not floor drain), IO (not cleanout), etc.

---

## APPENDIX F: Renovation-Specific Compliance Timing Chart

**Confidence:** HIGH

This chart shows WHEN each compliance activity must occur during a typical bathroom renovation timeline.

| Stage | Timing | Compliance Activities |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Pre-commencement** | Before any work starts | Submit Notice of Work / Notice of Intention to relevant plumbing authority |
| **Demolition** | Week 1 | Plumber disconnects and caps existing water and drainage (if demolition contractor not handling) |
| **Plumbing rough-in** | Week 1-2 | Install all concealed pipework, drainage, floor wastes. Pressure test water supply (15 min). Visual inspection of drainage. Book drainage inspection (if below-ground drainage altered) |
| **Drainage inspection** | Before covering | State plumbing authority or VBA inspects below-ground drainage (if applicable). Must pass before backfilling or screeding |
| **Waterproofing** | After rough-in passes inspection | Waterproofer applies membrane. Plumber verifies floor waste and penetration compatibility. NOT a plumbing compliance step, but plumber must have completed rough-in correctly for waterproofing to succeed |
| **Tiling** | After waterproofing | Not a plumbing compliance step, but plumber must verify fixture positions are correct before tiler finishes |
| **Plumbing fit-off** | After tiling complete | Connect all fixtures, taps, mixers, toilet. Install tempering valve (if not done at rough-in). Final leak check. Verify hot water temperature at all outlets (max 50 degrees C at personal hygiene fixtures) |
| **Final commissioning** | After fit-off | Test all fixtures for correct operation. Verify no leaks. Confirm tempering valve delivery temperature. Record hot water storage temperature (min 60 degrees C) |
| **Documentation** | Within state-specified deadline | Issue Certificate of Compliance to homeowner. Submit CoC to relevant authority. Prepare and submit Sewer Service Diagram (if drainage altered). Prepare and submit gas compliance certificate (if gas work done) |

**Scope impact:** The AI should generate plumbing scopes that reflect this timeline. Each stage should be a distinct section in the scope, with clear identification of which items belong to rough-in vs fit-off. This helps homeowners understand why the plumber needs to visit the site multiple times and helps builders schedule trades correctly.
