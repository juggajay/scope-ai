## 1. Rough-In (First Fix)

### 1.1 What Happens During Plumbing Rough-In

The plumbing rough-in (also called "first fix") is the installation of all concealed plumbing infrastructure -- pipework, drainage, and gas lines -- that will be hidden inside walls, under floors, and within ceiling spaces before they are closed up with plasterboard or screeding. This is the structural backbone of the plumbing system.

**Confidence: HIGH**

Specifically, the plumber performs the following during rough-in:

#### Water Supply (Hot and Cold)

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Run supply pipes** | Hot and cold water pipes are run from the mains/hot water system through wall frames, floor joists, and ceiling cavities to every fixture location (taps, shower, bath, toilet cistern, washing machine, dishwasher, fridge water line, outdoor tap). |
| **Pipe material** | Copper (traditional, still common in renovation where connecting to existing copper), PEX (cross-linked polyethylene -- now the dominant choice for renovation rough-in due to flexibility, corrosion resistance, and faster installation), or composite (PEX-AL-PEX). |
| **Pipe sizing** | Sized per AS/NZS 3500.1 based on flow rate calculations. Typical residential: 20mm mains entry, 15-20mm branch lines to fixtures. |
| **Isolation valves** | Mini stop valves (isolation valves) installed at every fixture point for future servicing. Required by AS/NZS 3500.1. |
| **Pipe support and fixing** | Pipes secured to framing with appropriate clips at required intervals. Copper: maximum 1.2m horizontal, 1.8m vertical. PEX: maximum 600mm horizontal, 900mm vertical. |
| **Expansion and contraction** | PEX expands more than copper. Allowance for thermal movement must be made, particularly for long hot water runs. |
| **Pressure limiting valve** | If mains pressure exceeds 500 kPa, a pressure limiting valve must be installed at the property entry (AS/NZS 3500.1). |
| **Tempering valve** | Required by AS/NZS 3500.4 to limit hot water delivery temperature to a maximum of 50 degrees Celsius at all personal hygiene outlets (basins, baths, showers) to prevent scalding. Typically installed at or near the hot water system. |

#### Drainage and Waste

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Waste pipe installation** | Waste pipes (typically 40mm for basins, 50mm for sinks/laundry tubs, 65-100mm for showers/baths, 100mm for toilets) run from each fixture location to the main sewer/drainage connection. |
| **Floor waste installation** | Floor waste gullies installed in wet areas (bathroom floors, laundry floors). The floor waste body and puddle flange are installed during rough-in. |
| **Toilet waste (pan connector)** | 100mm sewer pipe positioned for the toilet pan. Set-out distance (distance from wall to centre of waste) must match the selected toilet -- typically 140mm, 165mm, or 200mm set-out. Getting this wrong is a costly mistake. |
| **Shower waste** | Positioned to align with the shower floor plan. Must be set at the correct height to allow adequate fall from the furthest point of the shower floor to the waste (minimum 1:60 to 1:80 gradient per NCC). |
| **Fall/gradient** | All horizontal waste pipes must have adequate fall toward the discharge point. AS/NZS 3500.2 specifies minimum gradients: 1:40 for DN40 pipe, 1:40 for DN50, 1:60 for DN65, 1:60 for DN80, 1:60 for DN100. Too little fall causes blockages; too much fall can cause siphonage and pipe noise. |
| **Venting** | All drainage systems require venting to prevent trap seal loss (siphonage). Vent pipes are run from drainage branches up through the roof or connected to an air admittance valve (AAV) where permitted. AS/NZS 3500.2 governs all venting requirements. |
| **Trap installation** | P-traps or S-traps installed at each fixture (or integral to the fixture). Minimum 50mm water seal required by AS/NZS 3500.2. |
| **Cleanout points** | Access points for drain cleaning installed at required locations per AS/NZS 3500.2 -- typically at changes of direction greater than 45 degrees, at junctions, and at maximum 12m intervals on horizontal runs. |

#### Gas (If Applicable)

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Gas pipe installation** | Gas supply pipes (copper or stainless steel corrugated) run from the gas meter to each gas appliance location (cooktop, oven, gas heater, gas hot water system, BBQ point). |
| **Pipe sizing** | Sized per AS/NZS 5601.1 based on total gas demand (MJ/hr) and pipe run length. |
| **Isolation valves** | Gas isolation valve (ball valve with 1/4 turn) installed at each appliance location and at the gas meter. |
| **Ventilation** | Adequate ventilation for gas appliance locations verified. Flueing requirements confirmed for gas appliances that require it. |
| **Pressure testing** | Gas lines pressure tested before commissioning (see Section 1.5). |

**Scope-of-works implication:** Every plumbing rough-in scope must itemise the specific fixture locations, pipe materials, and any gas work. The scope should confirm which fixtures are staying in position (simpler rough-in) versus relocating (more complex, especially on concrete slabs).

### 1.2 When Must Rough-In Be Done Relative to Other Trades

Plumbing rough-in occupies a critical position in the renovation timeline. It must happen within a specific window -- after certain trades finish and before others can begin.

**Confidence: HIGH**

```
                    RENOVATION TIMELINE — PLUMBING POSITION
                    ========================================

  DEMOLITION          ROUGH-IN WINDOW              CLOSE-UP & BEYOND
  ──────────    ─────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────

  Strip-out  →  Plumber rough-in         →  Plasterer (wall close-up)
  Fixtures      (runs concurrently or    →  Waterproofing
  Tiles         just before electrical   →  Screed to falls
  Walls         rough-in)               →  Tiling
  Floor                                  →  Cabinetry
                                         →  Second fix / fit-off
```

#### Strict Sequencing Rules

| Rule | Explanation | Confidence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Plumbing rough-in AFTER demolition** | All existing fixtures, tiles, wall linings, and floor coverings must be removed before the plumber can access wall cavities, floor substrates, and drainage connections. Demolition must be complete and debris cleared. | HIGH |
| **Plumbing rough-in AFTER structural work** | If walls are being removed, beams installed, or floor structures modified, this must be complete before plumbing routes are finalised. A pipe run through a wall that subsequently gets removed is wasted work. | HIGH |
| **Plumbing rough-in BEFORE OR CONCURRENT WITH electrical rough-in** | Plumbing almost always goes first or runs concurrently with electrical. Pipes are larger, more rigid, and require precise positioning. Electrical cables are flexible and can be routed around pipes. If electrical goes first, plumbing installations may conflict with newly installed cables, causing costly rework. | HIGH |
| **Plumbing rough-in BEFORE wall close-up (plastering)** | All pipes, waste lines, and gas lines within wall cavities must be installed and tested before plasterboard is fixed. Once walls are closed, accessing pipes requires destructive opening of walls. | HIGH |
| **Plumbing rough-in BEFORE waterproofing** | All floor penetrations (floor wastes, shower wastes, toilet waste) must be installed and positioned before the waterproofing membrane is applied. The membrane must terminate at or in the drainage flanges. | HIGH |
| **Plumbing rough-in BEFORE screed to falls** | The floor waste position must be set by the plumber before the screeder can create the fall (gradient) toward the waste. | HIGH |
| **Plumbing rough-in BEFORE insulation** | Any insulation in wall cavities or ceiling spaces must wait until after plumbing (and electrical) rough-in is complete. | HIGH |

---

### 1.3 What Other Trades Need to Finish First

Before the plumber can begin rough-in, the following must be complete:

| Trade | What Must Be Complete | Why |
|-------|----------------------|-----|
| **Demolition contractor** | Full strip-out of existing fixtures, tiles, linings, flooring. Debris removed. Old plumbing capped and made safe. | Plumber needs clear access to wall cavities, floor substrate, and existing drainage connections. Cannot work around old fixtures. |
| **Builder / carpenter (structural)** | All structural modifications complete: wall removals, beam installations, new stud walls erected, floor structure modifications done. | Plumbing routes depend on the final room layout. If a wall is yet to be removed or a new wall is yet to be built, pipe positions will be wrong. |
| **Asbestos removalist (if applicable)** | Asbestos-containing materials identified and removed with clearance certificate issued. | In pre-1990 properties (recommended pre-2003), fibro wall linings, pipe lagging, and floor sheeting may contain asbestos. Plumber cannot disturb ACMs. Must be removed by a licensed asbestos removalist before any trades enter the space. |
| **Electrician (partial)** | Electrical isolation of the area. Main power circuits to the renovation zone switched off and tagged out at the switchboard. | Plumber is working near existing wiring in walls and floors. Electrical isolation is a safety prerequisite. The electrician does NOT need to complete their rough-in first -- they typically work concurrently or after the plumber. |
| **Builder / carpenter (framing)** | New wall frames erected and secured. Noggins (horizontal blocking) installed at required heights for fixture mounting (vanity, shower rail, toilet cistern). | Plumber runs pipes through and secures them to wall frames. Without framing in place, pipes cannot be accurately positioned. |

**Scope-of-works implication:** The plumbing rough-in scope should list these prerequisites as dependencies. The scope generator should flag if demolition or structural work is not yet complete when the plumber is scheduled.

---

### 1.4 Inspections Required Before Walls Close

This is a critical hold point in the renovation. All rough-in work must be inspected and approved before plasterboard (gyprock) is fixed to the wall frames.

**Confidence: HIGH**

#### What Gets Inspected

| Inspection Item | What the Inspector Checks | Standard |
|-----------------|--------------------------|----------|
| **Water supply pipe installation** | Correct pipe material, sizing, support intervals, isolation valves, expansion allowance, clearance from heat sources, no contact with dissimilar metals (copper vs. galvanised). | AS/NZS 3500.1 |
| **Drainage and waste installation** | Correct pipe sizes, adequate fall/gradient, proper trap installation, venting configuration, cleanout accessibility, connection to sewer/drainage. | AS/NZS 3500.2 |
| **Floor waste and puddle flange** | Correctly rebated into substrate, at correct height relative to finished floor level, puddle flange oriented correctly for membrane bonding. | AS 3740:2021 |
| **Gas pipe installation** | Correct pipe material, sizing, isolation valves, clearance from heat sources, ventilation at appliance locations. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Pressure test results** | Water supply tested and held at required pressure. Gas tested and held. Drainage tested (water or air). See Section 1.5. | AS/NZS 3500.1, AS/NZS 3500.2, AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Photographic record** | Thorough photos of all concealed pipework before wall close-up. This is not legally required in all states but is strongly recommended and considered best practice. Photos prove compliance without destructive opening of walls later. | Industry best practice |

#### Who Inspects

| State/Territory | Inspector | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| **NSW** | The plumber self-certifies by issuing a Certificate of Compliance (CoC) to the homeowner and lodging a Notice of Work (NoW) with Building Commission NSW and the local plumbing regulator. Council or a private certifier may also inspect as part of a Construction Certificate or CDC. | A Notice of Work is NOT required for "minor works" such as replacing tapware or like-for-like hot water system replacement. Bathroom/kitchen renovations where fixture locations change DO require a NoW. |
| **Victoria** | The plumber self-certifies by issuing a Compliance Certificate and lodging it with the Victorian Building Authority (VBA) within 5 business days of completing work valued at $750 or more (including labour and materials). A plumbing inspector (employed by the relevant council or water authority) may also conduct a physical inspection. | Only a licensed plumber (not merely a registered plumber) may issue compliance certificates. |
| **Queensland** | The plumber lodges "notifiable work" with the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC). A QBCC-approved plumbing inspector then inspects the work before it is covered up. | Notifiable work includes bathroom/kitchen renovations, hot water system installation/replacement, and installation/relocation of fixtures. |
| **South Australia** | The plumber self-certifies and lodges with the relevant council or SA Water. | |
| **Western Australia** | The plumber lodges with the relevant local government authority. An inspector may inspect within 48 hours. | |
| **Tasmania** | The plumber lodges with TasWater. | |
| **ACT** | The plumber lodges with Access Canberra. | |
| **Northern Territory** | The plumber lodges with the Power and Water Corporation. | |

**Critical principle:** The rough-in inspection is a HOLD POINT. Walls must NOT be closed up until the rough-in has been inspected or self-certified. Closing walls before inspection means the inspector may require destructive opening of walls to verify compliance -- at the homeowner's cost.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Every plumbing scope should include a line item for "Rough-in inspection / compliance certification" as a prerequisite to the plasterer beginning work.

---

### 1.5 Pressure Testing

Pressure testing is the method used to verify that plumbing installations are leak-free before they are concealed within walls and floors. There are separate tests for water supply, drainage, and gas systems.

**Confidence: HIGH**

#### Water Supply Pressure Test

| Parameter | Requirement | Standard |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Test method** | Hydrostatic test (pressurised with water). The system is filled with water and pressurised using a hand pump or test pump. | AS/NZS 3500.1 |
| **Test pressure** | 1500 kPa (approximately 15 bar or 217 psi). This is significantly higher than normal operating pressure (typically 300-500 kPa) to provide a safety margin. | AS/NZS 3500.1 |
| **Hold duration** | The system must hold pressure for a minimum of 30 minutes with no visible drop on the pressure gauge and no visible leaks at any joint, connection, or valve. | AS/NZS 3500.1 |
| **When performed** | After all supply pipes are installed and connected, but before walls are closed and before fixtures are connected (fixtures have lower pressure ratings and would be damaged). | During rough-in phase |
| **Documentation** | The plumber records the test pressure, duration, and result. This forms part of the compliance certificate documentation. | |

#### Drainage Pressure Test

| Parameter | Requirement | Standard |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Test method** | Water test (preferred) or air test. For water test: the drainage system is filled with water by plugging the lowest point and filling to the highest fixture connection. For air test: the system is sealed and pressurised with air. | AS/NZS 3500.2 |
| **Water test** | The system is filled with water to a head of at least 1.5m above the highest drain connection. Held for a minimum of 15 minutes. No visible leaks. | AS/NZS 3500.2 |
| **Air test** | The drainage system is sealed and slowly pressurised to 35 kPa (for DWV plastic pipe systems). Held for a minimum of 15 minutes with no measurable pressure loss. Joints and connections are checked with soapy water for leaks. | AS/NZS 3500.2 |
| **When performed** | After all waste pipes, vents, and floor wastes are installed, but before screeding, waterproofing, or wall close-up. | During rough-in phase |

#### Gas Pressure Test

| Parameter | Requirement | Standard |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Test method** | Air pressure test (NEVER test gas lines with gas during testing phase). The system is sealed and pressurised with air or inert gas (nitrogen). | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Test pressure** | For copper and stainless steel corrugated tubing (SSCT): tested at the greater of 1.5 times the operating pressure or 10 kPa, applied for 10 minutes minimum. For systems operating above 7 kPa: higher test pressures apply. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Hold duration** | Minimum 10 minutes at test pressure with no measurable drop on the gauge. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Documentation** | The gas fitter records the test pressure, duration, and result. A gas compliance certificate and/or gas compliance plate must be issued upon completion. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |

**Scope-of-works implication:** Pressure testing should be an explicit line item in the plumbing scope. The scope should specify what is being tested (water supply, drainage, gas) and note that testing occurs during rough-in, before wall close-up.

---

### 1.6 Typical Duration for Rough-In

Durations vary based on project complexity, number of fixtures, and whether the layout is changing.

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (durations are indicative and vary significantly based on site conditions, access, and plumber availability)

#### Bathroom Rough-In

| Scenario | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Same layout, fixture replacement only** | 0.5 - 1 day | Minimal pipe work. Cap existing, reconnect in same positions. May not need full rough-in if pipes are in good condition and positions are unchanged. |
| **Minor layout change** (e.g., move vanity 300mm, keep toilet and shower in place) | 1 - 1.5 days | Some pipe extensions and repositioning. Usually within existing wall cavities. |
| **Major layout change** (e.g., relocate toilet, move shower, change bath to shower or vice versa) | 1.5 - 3 days | Significant new pipe runs, drainage rerouting, possible slab penetration (concrete floor), new venting. |
| **Complete reconfiguration + slab work** | 3 - 5 days | Concrete cutting, new under-slab drainage, backfill, slab repair. Most complex and costly scenario. |

#### Kitchen Rough-In

| Scenario | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Same layout, fixture replacement only** | 0.5 - 1 day | Reconnect sink waste and water supply in same position. Gas reconnection if applicable. |
| **Sink relocation** (e.g., island bench with sink) | 1.5 - 2 days | New waste pipe run (often under floor), new water supply run, possible venting requirements. Island sinks require careful drainage planning due to distance from stack. |
| **Full kitchen layout change + gas relocation** | 2 - 3 days | Multiple fixture relocations, gas pipe rerouting, possible new drainage connections. |
| **Kitchen with outdoor kitchen connection** | 2 - 4 days | Indoor plumbing plus outdoor water, waste, and gas runs. |

#### Laundry Rough-In

| Scenario | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Same layout** | 0.5 day | Minimal work. Reconnect washing machine taps, tub waste, floor waste. |
| **New layout / new laundry location** | 1 - 2 days | New pipe runs, drainage, floor waste installation. |

#### Combined Projects

| Scenario | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Bathroom + laundry (back-to-back rooms)** | 2 - 3 days | Shared wall often shares drainage stack -- more efficient. |
| **Bathroom + kitchen (separate locations)** | 3 - 5 days | Two separate rough-in sites. Plumber mobilises to each. |
| **Full house renovation (2 bathrooms + kitchen + laundry)** | 5 - 10 days | Scale project. Multiple drainage connections, multiple stacks, significant pipe work. |

---

## 2. Waterproofing Coordination

### 2.1 What Plumbing Rough-In Must Be Complete BEFORE Waterproofing

This is one of the most critical sequencing dependencies in any wet-area renovation. Getting it wrong results in either compromised waterproofing (leading to leaks) or costly rework (tearing out waterproofing to fix plumbing).

**Confidence: HIGH**

The following plumbing work MUST be fully complete and inspected before the waterproofer begins:

| Plumbing Item | Why It Must Be Complete Before Waterproofing | What Happens If It Is Not |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Floor waste body and puddle flange** | The waterproofing membrane must terminate AT or IN the puddle flange to create a sealed connection between the membrane and the drainage system. The puddle flange provides the bonding surface for the membrane. | If the floor waste is not installed, the waterproofer cannot seal the membrane to the drainage. A floor waste installed AFTER waterproofing penetrates the membrane, creating a potential leak path. |
| **Shower waste body and puddle flange** | Same principle as floor waste. The shower waste must be at the correct height and position before screeding to falls and waterproofing. | Late installation means cutting through the membrane and screeding -- major rework. |
| **Toilet waste pipe** | The 100mm sewer pipe for the toilet must be in its final position (correct set-out distance from the wall) and capped. The membrane must be sealed around this penetration. | Repositioning the toilet waste after waterproofing means cutting the membrane. The waterproofer must then return to re-waterproof the area -- additional cost and delay. |
| **All wall penetrations for water supply** | Hot and cold water supply pipes that penetrate through waterproofed walls (shower mixer, bath taps, basin taps if wall-mounted) must be in position. The waterproofer seals around each penetration using proprietary flange systems or sealant. | Late pipe installation means punching holes through the completed membrane. Each new penetration must be individually waterproofed -- and the risk of failure increases with each post-membrane penetration. |
| **Bath waste (if freestanding or inset bath)** | The waste pipe for the bath must be positioned and connected before the bath is set and the surrounding area is waterproofed. | If the bath waste is not in position, the bath cannot be set, and the waterproofer cannot seal around the bath edge/upstand. |
| **Any in-floor pipes** | Any hot water recirculation pipes, hydronic heating pipes, or other services running through the floor substrate must be installed and tested before waterproofing. | Post-waterproofing installation means cutting through the membrane. |

#### Critical Puddle Flange Detail

The puddle flange is the interface between plumbing and waterproofing. Getting it right is essential:

```
                    PUDDLE FLANGE CROSS-SECTION
                    ===========================

     ─────────┘           └─────────
     ← Puddle flange body (PVC, rebated into substrate) →
     ─────────────────────────

              │  floor)   │
              ▼           ▼
```

**Key requirements per AS 3740:2021:**
- The puddle flange must be rebated (recessed) into the floor substrate so the flange lip sits flush with (or slightly below) the surrounding substrate surface.
- The waterproofing membrane must overlap the puddle flange lip by a minimum amount specified by the membrane manufacturer (typically 50-75mm overlap).
- The puddle flange should NOT be screeded over. Screed is applied around the flange, not over it.
- The puddle flange must have weep holes or a threaded spigot to allow subsurface moisture to drain into the waste pipe (preventing moisture trapped under tiles from causing mould or tile lifting).

---

### 2.2 What Happens If the Sequence Is Wrong (Cost/Rework Implications)

**Confidence: HIGH**

If plumbing is not complete before waterproofing, the consequences range from minor additional cost to complete demolition and restart:

| Scenario | Consequence | Estimated Additional Cost | Time Delay |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Floor waste installed after waterproofing** | Waterproofing membrane must be cut to install the waste. The waterproofer must return to patch the membrane around the new waste. Risk of membrane failure at the junction. | $300-$800 for waterproofer return visit + re-test | 1-2 days |
| **Toilet waste repositioned after waterproofing** | Membrane cut, slab or floor modified for new waste position, membrane re-applied and re-tested. Often requires re-screeding the surrounding area. | $500-$1,500+ | 2-4 days |
| **Shower mixer pipes moved after waterproofing** | Wall membrane must be cut, pipes repositioned, membrane patched. If the original membrane product does not bond well to itself (some liquid-applied membranes), the entire shower wall may need to be re-waterproofed. | $400-$1,200 | 1-3 days |
| **Waterproofing done before plumbing inspection** | If the plumbing inspector requires changes to concealed pipework, the membrane must be removed, plumbing corrected, and membrane re-applied from scratch. | $1,000-$3,000+ (full re-waterproof) | 3-7 days |
| **Complete rework (worst case)** | If a hidden plumbing leak damages the waterproofing or if fundamental plumbing layout changes are needed post-waterproofing, the entire wet area may need to be stripped back to substrate, plumbing corrected, re-screeded, re-waterproofed, and re-tiled. | $5,000-$15,000+ | 2-4 weeks |

**Key rule for the scope generator:** The scope must flag waterproofing as a HOLD POINT that cannot proceed until ALL plumbing rough-in in the wet area is complete, inspected, and signed off.

---

### 2.3 Floor Waste Positioning Relative to Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

The floor waste position is determined during the plumbing rough-in and has cascading effects on waterproofing, screeding, and tiling:

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Position selection** | The floor waste position is typically specified on the bathroom layout plan. Common locations: centre of shower floor, adjacent to vanity, near doorway (for general bathroom drainage). The plumber sets the waste body at this location during rough-in. |
| **Height setting** | The top of the puddle flange must be set at a height that allows the finished tile surface to be flush with (or 1-2mm above) the flange grate. This requires the plumber, screeder, and tiler to coordinate on: tile thickness + adhesive thickness + screed depth + membrane thickness. |
| **Fall calculation** | The floor must fall toward the waste at a minimum gradient of 1:80 (per NCC) in the shower area. The screeder creates this fall AFTER the plumber has set the waste position. If the waste is too high or too low relative to the surrounding floor, the screeder cannot achieve adequate fall without creating an uncomfortable step or leaving standing water. |
| **Multiple floor wastes** | In larger bathrooms, two floor wastes may be required (one in shower, one in general floor area). Both must be installed during rough-in. |
| **Clearance for maintenance** | If a floor waste is located under a vanity, the plumber should ensure a minimum 300mm clearance from the waste to any obstruction (vanity base, pipes) to allow future drain cleaning access. |
| **Waterproofer's membrane termination** | The waterproofing membrane terminates at each floor waste puddle flange. The membrane must be bonded to the flange lip as a continuous waterproof seal. This is a common failure point if not done correctly. |

---

### 2.4 Shower Waste and Hob Interaction with Waterproofing Membrane

**Confidence: HIGH**

The shower area is the highest-risk zone for waterproofing failure because it receives the most sustained water exposure. The interaction between plumbing (waste), building (hob/kerb), and waterproofing (membrane) must be precisely coordinated.

#### Shower Hob (Kerb) Requirements

A shower hob is the raised threshold at the edge of the shower that contains water within the shower area. Per NCC and AS 3740:2021:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Hob height** | Minimum hob height varies by state and configuration. For a standard shower with a hob and no door seal: the hob must be high enough to contain water and prevent overflow. Typical minimum: 5-10mm above the finished floor level outside the shower (after tile). |
| **Hob construction** | Usually formed from mortar (sand/cement) or a proprietary prefabricated hob element (e.g., EZY Hob). Must be securely fixed to the floor and sealed against the wall before waterproofing. |
| **Membrane over hob** | The waterproofing membrane must be continuous over the top of the hob, down the outside face, and terminate not less than 50mm onto the floor outside the shower area. This creates a "bathtub" effect -- the entire shower floor and walls are sealed, with the hob forming the dam wall. |
| **Hob/wall junction** | Bond breakers must be installed at all hob/wall junctions before the membrane is applied. This prevents the membrane from cracking at internal angles due to movement. |
| **Level thresholds / hobless showers** | For walk-in (hobless) showers, the waterproofing requirements are more stringent. The membrane must extend across the threshold and onto the bathroom floor for at least 50mm beyond the shower opening. The entire bathroom floor may need to be waterproofed (depends on state interpretation). |

#### Plumbing-Waterproofing-Hob Sequence

```
Step 1: Plumber installs shower waste body + puddle flange (rough-in)
           ↓
Step 2: Builder constructs shower hob/kerb (mortar or prefab)
           ↓
Step 3: All gaps, joints, and intersections of hob substrate are made flush
           ↓
Step 4: Screeder applies screed to create fall toward waste
           (minimum 1:80 gradient from furthest point to waste)
           ↓
Step 5: Screed cures (minimum 24-48 hours)
           ↓
Step 6: Waterproofer applies primer to substrate
           ↓
Step 7: Waterproofer installs bond breakers at all internal angles
           (wall/floor, wall/wall, hob/wall, hob/floor junctions)
           ↓
Step 8: Waterproofer applies membrane:
           - Bonds membrane to puddle flange at shower waste
           - Applies membrane across shower floor
           - Extends membrane up walls to minimum 1800mm height
           - Extends membrane over hob, down outside face, 50mm onto floor
           ↓
Step 9: Membrane cures (typically 2 coats, 24 hours between coats)
           ↓
Step 10: Waterproofing inspected and certified
           ↓
Step 11: Tiler begins (waterproofing certificate must be obtained FIRST)

### 2.5 Responsibility for Waterproofing Failure Due to Plumbing Penetrations

**Confidence: HIGH**

This is a significant liability and warranty question that the scope generator should flag clearly.

#### Who Is Responsible

| Scenario | Responsible Party | Explanation |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Waterproofing membrane fails at a puddle flange installed by the plumber** | Typically the **waterproofer** if the membrane was not correctly bonded to the flange. May be the **plumber** if the flange was incorrectly installed (e.g., not rebated, wrong height, wrong type). | Responsibility depends on who caused the failure. If the flange was correctly installed but the membrane was not properly bonded, the waterproofer is liable. If the flange was installed at the wrong height, causing the membrane to bridge rather than bond, the plumber is liable. |
| **Post-waterproofing plumbing penetration fails** | The **plumber** who made the penetration. If the plumber penetrated a completed membrane without having it re-waterproofed by the original waterproofer, the plumber bears liability. | This is a common dispute. Best practice: the plumber should NEVER penetrate a completed membrane without the waterproofer being notified and returning to seal the penetration. |
| **Waterproofing fails at a tap penetration in the shower wall** | The **waterproofer** if the proprietary flange system or sealant was not correctly applied. The **plumber** if the pipe was not correctly positioned (e.g., pipe moves after waterproofing due to inadequate securing). | AS 3740:2021 requires tap penetrations to be "waterproofed by sealing with proprietary flange systems or a sealant." The waterproofer is responsible for sealing around properly positioned pipes. |
| **General waterproofing failure (unrelated to plumbing)** | The **waterproofer**. In NSW and Victoria, waterproofing defects are classified as **major structural defects**. NSW: 6-year warranty period. Victoria: 10-year limitation of action. | This extended warranty period reflects the severity and cost of waterproofing failures. |
| **Builder-coordinated project** | The **builder** (head contractor) is ultimately responsible for ensuring all trades are coordinated and sequenced correctly. If the builder scheduled the waterproofer before the plumber had finished, the builder is liable for any resulting failure. | Under the builder's duty of care and statutory warranties. |
| **Owner-managed project (no head contractor)** | The **homeowner** becomes the de facto project manager. If the homeowner incorrectly sequenced trades, they bear the risk. However, each individual tradesperson is still liable for the quality of their own work. | This is common in smaller renovations. The homeowner is "ultimately responsible for ensuring all work complies with regulations -- even if a contractor is at fault." |

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope should include a clear note about waterproofing being a HOLD POINT and should flag the sequencing dependency between plumbing rough-in and waterproofing. For owner-managed projects, the scope should emphasise that the plumber's rough-in MUST be inspected before waterproofing begins.

#### Insurance and Warranty Notes

- In NSW, waterproofing work valued at $500 or more must be completed by a **licensed waterproofing contractor** (separate from the plumbing licence).
- Upon completion, the waterproofer must issue a **Waterproofing Certificate** proving compliance with AS 3740.
- The homeowner should retain this certificate permanently -- it is required for insurance claims and future property sales.
- In strata properties, if an owner renovates a bathroom, responsibility for the waterproofing may shift from the body corporate to the individual lot owner. A by-law should be registered to clarify ongoing maintenance responsibilities.

## 3. Stack Work & Drainage Modifications

### 3.1 What Is Stack Work

The "stack" (also called the "soil stack" or "drainage stack") is the main vertical drainage pipe that carries waste from upper-floor fixtures down to the underground sewer line. In single-storey houses, the equivalent is the main horizontal drainage line running from the bathroom/kitchen to the sewer connection point.

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Soil stack** | Vertical pipe (typically 100mm PVC in modern installations) that carries toilet waste (and often other fixture waste) from upper floors to the underground drainage. |
| **Waste stack** | Vertical pipe (typically 50-65mm) that carries waste water from non-toilet fixtures (basins, showers, baths, sinks). May be combined with the soil stack in modern installations. |
| **Vent stack** | Vertical pipe extending from the drainage system through the roof to atmosphere. Allows air into the system to prevent trap seal loss (siphonage) and allows sewer gases to dissipate above the roof line. |
| **Main drain** | The horizontal pipe running from the base of the stack (or from the lowest fixtures in a single-storey home) to the property sewer connection (boundary trap or junction). |
| **Boundary trap / disconnector** | The access point where the property drainage connects to the council sewer main. Usually located near the front boundary of the property. |

### 3.2 When Does Stack Work Happen

Stack work and drainage modifications happen during the rough-in phase, typically at the START of rough-in because they are the most constrained element:

**Confidence: HIGH**

```
STACK WORK TIMING IN RENOVATION SEQUENCE
=========================================

Demolition
    ↓
STACK WORK / DRAINAGE MODIFICATIONS  ← First thing the plumber does
    ↓
Remaining rough-in (branch connections, supply pipes)
    ↓
Testing and inspection
    ↓
Wall close-up
    ↓
... rest of renovation
```

| Timing Rule | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Stack work is the first plumbing task** | Drainage modifications are the most disruptive and the most constrained. They may require concrete cutting, excavation, and access to sub-floor spaces. Everything else (supply pipes, gas) routes around the drainage. |
| **Must be complete before wall close-up** | Stack modifications that pass through wall cavities must be finished before plastering. |
| **Must be complete before waterproofing** | Any new floor penetrations for drainage must be sealed into the substrate before the waterproofing membrane is applied. |
| **Must be complete before screeding** | New drainage positions must be set before the screeder creates falls toward the waste. |

### 3.3 How Stack Work Affects Other Trades

| Trade Affected | Impact | Coordination Required |
|----------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Builder / carpenter** | Stack relocation may require cutting through floor joists, bearers, or structural elements. If the stack passes through a load-bearing wall or beam, the builder may need to provide structural reinforcement or create an opening (with structural engineer sign-off). | Builder must confirm structural clearance for any new penetrations. |
| **Demolition contractor** | If the existing stack is embedded in concrete or passes through structural elements, additional demolition may be required to access it. This should be identified during the demolition scope. | Demo scope should include stack access if relocation is planned. |
| **Tiler** | New floor penetrations affect tile layout. The tiler needs to know the exact position and size of all floor penetrations before beginning tile layout planning. | Tiler should be provided with the as-built drainage plan. |
| **Waterproofer** | Every floor penetration must be waterproofed. Additional penetrations mean additional waterproofing complexity and cost. | Waterproofer needs to know all penetration locations before starting. |
| **Electrician** | Electrical services in walls and floors must be routed around drainage pipes. Drainage pipes are larger and less flexible, so electrical must accommodate plumbing routes. | Electrical rough-in should follow plumbing rough-in in the same areas. |

### 3.4 Access Requirements for Stack Work

| Access Type | What Is Needed | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Sub-floor access (suspended floor)** | Crawl space access (minimum 450mm clearance preferred) beneath the floor to modify or connect to existing drainage. | Common in older homes with timber-framed floors. Plumber works from below. If access is too tight, floor boards or sheeting may need to be lifted. |
| **Slab penetration (concrete slab floor)** | Concrete cutting and excavation to access existing under-slab drainage or to create new drainage runs. | Common in post-1960s homes and all apartments. Requires concrete cutting equipment. Structural engineer may need to verify that cutting does not compromise slab integrity (especially post-tensioned slabs). |
| **Ceiling access (multi-storey)** | Access to ceiling cavity of the floor below to modify or connect to drainage that runs horizontally before dropping into the stack. | In apartments, this may mean accessing the ceiling of the unit below -- requiring strata approval and coordination with the downstairs neighbour. |
| **External access** | Access to external drainage (boundary trap, main drain, external stack) for connection or modification. | May require excavation of landscaping, paths, or driveways. Council may need to approve any work near the property boundary. |
| **Roof access** | Access to the roof to modify or extend the vent stack. | Required if the stack is being relocated or if new venting is needed. |

### 3.5 What Triggers Stack Relocation

Not every renovation requires stack work. The following changes trigger stack relocation or modification:

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Trigger | Example | Complexity |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Toilet relocation** | Moving the toilet to a different wall or position in the bathroom. The 100mm sewer pipe must be rerouted to the new position. | HIGH -- especially on concrete slabs. Requires concrete cutting, new under-slab pipe run, and reconnection to main drain. May require new venting. |
| **New bathroom location** | Adding a bathroom where one did not exist (e.g., converting a bedroom to an ensuite). Requires entirely new drainage connections from the new bathroom to the existing main drain or stack. | HIGH -- new branch drain, new stack connection, new venting. Significant structural and access implications. |
| **Shower relocation** | Moving the shower to a different location. Shower waste (typically 50-65mm) must be rerouted. | MEDIUM -- less complex than toilet relocation (smaller pipe, less critical fall requirements). |
| **Kitchen sink relocation** (e.g., to an island bench) | Moving the kitchen sink away from the existing wall-mounted waste. Island sinks require careful drainage planning because they are typically far from the existing stack and venting is more complex. | MEDIUM-HIGH -- may require under-floor pipe runs and an air admittance valve (AAV) for venting. |
| **Combining or separating wet areas** | Merging a bathroom and laundry, or separating them. Drainage connections may need to be reconfigured. | MEDIUM |
| **Building extension** | Adding a new room that requires plumbing (e.g., extending the house to add a new bathroom). | HIGH -- new drainage run to main sewer, possibly requiring new inspection openings and council approval. |
| **Floor level changes** | Changing the finished floor level (e.g., lowering a floor to create a step-free shower). Floor waste and drainage heights must be adjusted. | MEDIUM |

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope generator should ask whether any fixtures are being relocated. If yes, it should flag potential stack/drainage modification work and its associated cost premium (typically $1,500-$5,000+ depending on complexity and floor construction type).

## 4. Second Fix (Fit-Off)

### 4.1 What Is Second Fix Plumbing

Second fix (also called "fit-off" or "trim-out") is the installation of all visible plumbing fixtures and fittings after the concealed rough-in work has been completed and the surrounding finishes (walls, tiles, benchtops) are in place. This is the stage where the bathroom or kitchen starts to look finished.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 4.2 When Does Second Fix Happen

Second fix plumbing occurs AFTER:

| Prerequisite | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| **Waterproofing is complete and certified** | The waterproofer must have finished and the waterproofing certificate must be issued. |
| **Tiling is complete** | All wall and floor tiles must be laid, grouted, and cured. The plumber connects fixtures to tile-finished walls and floors. Connecting fixtures before tiling is complete risks damaging tiles or getting grout on new fixtures. |
| **Vanity / cabinetry is installed** | For basin plumbing in bathrooms and sinks in kitchens, the vanity or cabinet must be in place so the plumber can connect waste and water supply to the fixture within the cabinet. |
| **Benchtop is installed** (kitchen) | For kitchen sinks (especially undermount), the stone or laminate benchtop must be installed with the sink cut-out in place. The plumber connects the sink, taps, waste, and dishwasher after the benchtop is installed. Resin/glue used to bond stone benchtops needs at least 24 hours to harden -- plumber should be booked 2 days after benchtop installation. |
| **Shower screen brackets are installed** (but screen not yet fitted) | The shower screen installer typically installs the brackets/channels first. The plumber then installs the shower mixer, showerhead, and rail. The glass screen is installed last to avoid damage. |
| **Painting is complete** (ceiling, walls above tile line) | In bathrooms, painting of the ceiling and any wall areas above the tile line should ideally be done before or concurrent with second fix to avoid paint on new fixtures. However, in practice, painting sometimes happens after second fix with masking. |

**In the overall sequence:**

### 4.3 Typical Items Included in Second Fix

**Confidence: HIGH**

#### Bathroom Second Fix

| Item | Detail | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Toilet installation** | Set toilet pan on floor (fixed with silicone to tiles, NOT screwed through waterproofing membrane to slab), connect to waste pipe via pan connector, connect cistern to water supply, adjust fill valve and flush mechanism, check for leaks. | Toilet must match the set-out distance established during rough-in. If the set-out is wrong, an offset pan connector may be needed (adds cost and reduces flow efficiency). |
| **Basin/vanity connection** | Install basin (drop-in, undermount, or vessel), connect pop-up waste, install P-trap or bottle trap, connect hot and cold water supply lines to basin taps or mixer, test for leaks. | If wall-mounted taps: connect tap bodies to in-wall rough-in pipes. If benchtop-mounted: install through vanity top. |
| **Tapware installation** | Install basin taps or mixer, shower mixer (trim plate and handle), bath spout/mixer, kitchen sink taps. Connect to rough-in water supply points. | Tapware must match the rough-in positions exactly. Misalignment between rough-in pipe centres and tap/mixer centres causes visible gaps or inability to install. |
| **Shower mixer, head, and rail** | Install shower mixer trim plate, showerhead, slide rail, and arm. Connect to in-wall rough-in connections. Test temperature control and flow. | If a thermostatic mixer: commission and set maximum temperature. |
| **Bath spout and mixer** | Install bath spout (wall-mounted or freestanding), connect bath mixer to in-wall rough-in. Fill bath and check waste for leaks. | Freestanding baths require floor-mounted plumbing connections -- confirm during rough-in. |
| **Floor waste grate** | Install the finish grate into the floor waste body. Some grates are tile-insert type (tiler prepares a tile to sit in the grate frame). | Floor waste grate should sit flush with the finished tile surface. |
| **Heated towel rail connection** (if hydronic) | Connect hydronic heated towel rail to hot water circuit and test. | Hydronic rails are plumber-installed. Electric rails are electrician-installed. |
| **Washing machine taps** (if bathroom/laundry combo) | Install washing machine tap set (hot and cold). | Usually a chrome or white minicock set screwed to the wall at machine height. |

#### Kitchen Second Fix

| Item | Detail | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Sink installation** | Install sink (undermount bonded during benchtop install, or drop-in after benchtop). Connect waste pipe, install P-trap, connect garbage disposal if applicable. | Undermount sinks are bonded to the underside of the stone benchtop by the stonemason -- the plumber then connects the waste and water. Drop-in sinks are installed by the plumber. |
| **Kitchen tap/mixer** | Install kitchen mixer tap through benchtop (tap hole drilled by stonemason during template). Connect to hot and cold supply lines under benchtop. | Pull-out mixer taps require a larger tap hole and may have a counterweight that hangs below the benchtop -- ensure adequate clearance in the cabinet. |
| **Dishwasher connection** | Connect dishwasher water supply (cold or hot, depending on model), connect dishwasher waste hose to sink waste or dedicated waste connection, install high-loop on waste hose to prevent back-siphonage. | Dishwasher connection point should be in the cabinet adjacent to the dishwasher (confirmed during rough-in). |
| **Water filter/purifier** | If specified, install under-sink water filter system. Connect to cold water supply (typically via a saddle valve or tee fitting), install dedicated filter tap through benchtop. | Filter tap hole location must be confirmed during benchtop template stage. |
| **Fridge water connection** | If the fridge has a water/ice dispenser, run a small-diameter water line from the nearest cold water supply point to the fridge location. | Often overlooked during rough-in. Should be flagged in the scope if the homeowner plans to have a plumbed fridge. |
| **Pot filler** (if specified) | Wall-mounted pot filler tap above the cooktop. Connected to cold water supply during rough-in, trim plate and faucet installed during second fix. | Requires a rough-in point in the wall behind/above the cooktop -- must be planned during design stage. |

#### Laundry Second Fix

| Item | Detail | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Laundry tub** | Install laundry tub (freestanding or cabinet-mounted), connect waste, connect hot and cold taps. | |
| **Washing machine taps** | Install washing machine tap set. | |
| **Dryer connection** (if condensing dryer with drain) | Connect condensing dryer drain hose to waste. | Not all dryers require plumbing. Only condensing dryers with external drain. |
| **Floor waste grate** | Install finish grate in floor waste. | |

### 4.4 Duration Estimates for Second Fix

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (varies by number of fixtures and complexity)

| Project Type | Second Fix Duration | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------|----- |
| **Bathroom (standard -- toilet, vanity, shower, bath)** | 4-8 hours (0.5-1 day) | Straightforward if all rough-in positions are correct and all fixtures are on site. |
| **Bathroom (complex -- multiple mixers, freestanding bath, wall-mounted tapware, hydronic towel rail)** | 1-1.5 days | Premium tapware and complex fixture types add time. |
| **Kitchen (standard -- sink, mixer, dishwasher)** | 2-4 hours | Quick if benchtop is installed and all connections are accessible. |
| **Kitchen (complex -- undermount sink, pot filler, water filter, fridge water line, gas cooktop connection)** | 4-8 hours (0.5-1 day) | Multiple connections and gas work add time. |
| **Laundry** | 2-4 hours | Simple connections. |
| **Bathroom + kitchen combined** | 1-1.5 days | |

---

## 5. Final Fix

### 5.1 What Is Included in Final Fix

The final fix is the last plumbing visit to the site. It covers gas connection and commissioning, final testing, commissioning of all plumbing systems, and the issuance of compliance documentation. In some projects, "final fix" is combined with second fix into a single visit. In larger projects (or where gas work is involved), it is a separate stage.

**Confidence: HIGH**

#### Gas Connection and Appliance Commissioning

| Task | Detail | Licence Required |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Gas cooktop connection** | Connect gas cooktop to the gas supply point in the benchtop cabinet. Test for leaks using soapy water or electronic leak detector. Commission the appliance (test all burners, check flame quality, verify gas pressure at the appliance). | Licensed gas fitter (in most states, this is a plumber with a gas fitting endorsement) |
| **Gas oven connection** | Connect gas oven to gas supply point. Commission and test. | Licensed gas fitter |
| **Gas hot water system connection** | Connect gas supply to hot water system. Commission: check gas pressure, verify ignition, test temperature output, check flue/exhaust. | Licensed gas fitter |
| **Gas BBQ point** (outdoor) | Connect gas bayonet fitting or dedicated BBQ gas line. Test for leaks. | Licensed gas fitter |
| **Gas heater connection** | Connect gas heater to supply. Commission: test ignition, flame quality, thermostat operation, flue clearance (if flued). | Licensed gas fitter |
| **Gas compliance plate/badge** | After commissioning, the gas fitter affixes a gas compliance plate or badge to each gas appliance installation. This is a permanent record that the appliance was installed and commissioned by a licensed gas fitter. | Mandatory -- AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Gas compliance certificate** | A formal certificate issued by the licensed gas fitter confirming that all gas work complies with AS/NZS 5601.1 and relevant state regulations. A copy is provided to the homeowner and lodged with the relevant authority. | Mandatory |

#### Appliance Commissioning (Non-Gas)

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Hot water system commissioning** (electric/heat pump/solar) | Verify correct installation, test temperature output at fixtures, check tempering valve operation (must deliver no more than 50 degrees C at personal hygiene outlets), verify pressure relief valve operation, check expansion control valve. |
| **Dishwasher commissioning** | Run a test cycle, check for leaks at water supply and waste connections, verify high-loop on waste hose. |
| **Water filter system** | Flush filter as per manufacturer's instructions, check for leaks, test flow rate. |
| **Washing machine** (if plumber is commissioning) | Connect hoses, run test cycle, check for leaks. (Note: often done by the homeowner or appliance delivery team, not the plumber.) |

### 5.2 Final Testing and Certification

| Test/Certification | Detail | Standard |
|--------------------|--------|----------|
| **Final water pressure test** | Verify that all fixtures receive adequate flow and pressure. Check for any leaks at new connections. | AS/NZS 3500.1 |
| **Hot water temperature check** | Measure hot water temperature at each personal hygiene outlet (basin, shower, bath). Must not exceed 50 degrees C. Record readings. | AS/NZS 3500.4 |
| **Drainage function test** | Run water through all fixtures simultaneously and verify that all waste drains correctly, no blockages, no slow drainage, no gurgling (which would indicate a venting issue). | AS/NZS 3500.2 |
| **Gas leak test** | Final leak test on all gas connections using soapy water or electronic detector. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Certificate of Compliance** | The plumber issues a Certificate of Compliance (CoC) covering all plumbing and drainage work performed. This is lodged with the relevant state authority (see Section 1.4 for state-specific requirements). | State legislation |
| **Gas compliance certificate** | Separate certificate for all gas work. Issued by the licensed gas fitter. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Plumbing compliance plate** | A permanent plate or badge affixed to the gas installation (at the gas meter or appliance) recording the gas fitter's licence number, date of work, and compliance details. | AS/NZS 5601.1 |
| **Handover to homeowner** | The plumber provides the homeowner with: copies of all compliance certificates, warranty information for any fixtures or equipment installed, maintenance advice (e.g., tempering valve servicing intervals, water filter replacement schedule), and emergency shut-off locations. | Best practice |

**Scope-of-works implication:** Final fix items should be listed in the scope as separate line items from rough-in and second fix. Gas connection and commissioning should be explicitly itemised because they require additional licensing (gas fitter endorsement) and generate separate compliance documentation.

---

## 6. Coordination with Other Trades

This section is critical for the scope generator. Plumbing intersects with almost every other trade on a renovation site. Poor coordination between trades is the single most common cause of delays, rework, and budget blowouts.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 6.1 Coordination with Electrician

Plumbing and electrical are the two services trades that share wall cavities, floor spaces, and ceiling voids. They must be coordinated carefully to avoid conflicts.

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Shared service routes in walls** | Both trades run services through the same wall cavities. Plumbing pipes (especially 40-100mm waste pipes) take up significantly more space than electrical cables. Plumbing should be run first, with electrical cables routed around the pipes. | Plumber first | Rough-in phase |
| **Hot water system wiring** | Electric hot water systems, heat pump hot water systems, and solar hot water systems all require dedicated electrical circuits. The electrician installs the power supply (typically 20A or 32A dedicated circuit) to the hot water system location. The plumber installs the unit and connects the water. Both trades must agree on the installation location and ensure adequate clearance for both electrical and plumbing connections. | Plumber specifies location; electrician provides power | Rough-in (electrical) + Final fix (both trades) |
| **Hydronic heating** | Hydronic (in-floor or radiator) heating systems require both plumbing (hot water circulation pipes, manifolds, boiler connections) and electrical (boiler power supply, thermostats, zone valve actuators, circulation pump power). The plumber installs the hydronic pipework during rough-in. The electrician installs power and control wiring. Both trades commission the system together. | Plumber leads; electrician supports | Rough-in (both) + Final fix (both) |
| **Exhaust fan ducting** | Bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans require both electrical (power supply and switching) and ducting (from the fan unit to an external wall or roof vent). The electrician typically installs the fan unit and wiring. The ducting may be installed by the electrician, the builder, or a specialist ducting installer. The plumber is NOT typically involved in exhaust fan installation -- but if the exhaust duct route conflicts with plumbing in the ceiling space, coordination is needed. | Electrician leads | Rough-in phase |
| **Instantaneous hot water system** | Electric instantaneous (tankless) hot water systems require a high-amperage dedicated circuit (often 3-phase for larger units). The plumber installs the unit; the electrician provides the power supply. Coordination on location is critical -- these units are often wall-mounted and need both water supply, waste (pressure relief drain), and electrical connections in close proximity. | Plumber specifies location; electrician provides power | Final fix (both trades) |
| **Under-floor heating (electric)** | Electric under-floor heating mats/cables are installed by the electrician (or the tiler in some cases). The plumber is NOT involved in electric under-floor heating. However, if the bathroom also has hydronic heating elements, both systems must be coordinated to avoid conflicts in the floor substrate. | Electrician leads | After rough-in, before screed/waterproofing |
| **Dishwasher connection** | The dishwasher requires both a dedicated GPO (electrician) and water/waste connections (plumber). Both connections should be in the cabinet adjacent to the dishwasher. During rough-in, both trades must agree on the exact location within the cabinet to avoid the GPO being behind a pipe or vice versa. | Both trades coordinate | Rough-in (both) + Second fix (both) |
| **Garbage disposal unit** | Requires a dedicated GPO (electrician -- often installed inside the sink cabinet with a switch above the benchtop) and connection to the sink waste (plumber). | Both trades coordinate | Second fix (both) |
| **Switchboard proximity** | In some renovations, the switchboard is near the bathroom or kitchen. Plumbing pipes should maintain clearance from the switchboard (minimum 300mm separation between water pipes and the switchboard is recommended, though specific distances are governed by AS/NZS 3000). | Both trades coordinate | Rough-in |

### 6.2 Coordination with Tiler

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Floor waste height relative to tile thickness** | The plumber sets the floor waste puddle flange at a height that accounts for: screed thickness + waterproofing membrane thickness + tile adhesive thickness + tile thickness. The finished tile surface should be flush with (or 1-2mm above) the floor waste grate. If the plumber sets the waste too high, tiles cannot be laid flush. If too low, water pools around the waste instead of draining. | Plumber installs; tiler confirms height is correct before tiling | Plumber: rough-in. Tiler: pre-tiling check |
| **Tile thickness confirmation** | The tiler must confirm the tile thickness and adhesive bed thickness to the plumber BEFORE the plumber sets the floor waste height. Different tiles have different thicknesses (6mm porcelain to 12mm natural stone). This information is needed during rough-in. | Tiler provides info; plumber uses it | Design/rough-in phase |
| **Shower floor falls** | The screed to falls (gradient toward the shower waste) must be created after the plumber has set the waste and before the tiler tiles the shower floor. The tiler must verify that the falls are adequate and consistent before tiling. | Screeder creates falls; tiler verifies | After plumbing rough-in, before tiling |
| **Wall tile penetrations** | The tiler must cut tiles accurately around plumbing penetrations (shower mixer, taps, showerhead arm). Pipe positions must be marked clearly on the wall before tiling. Misaligned cuts are visible and costly to fix. | Plumber marks positions; tiler cuts around them | During tiling |
| **Floor waste grate type** | If a tile-insert floor waste grate is specified, the tiler needs to prepare a tile cut to fit inside the grate frame. The plumber installs the waste body; the tiler and plumber coordinate on the grate type and tile insert dimensions. | Joint coordination | Second fix (plumber installs body, tiler prepares tile insert) |
| **Timing: tiling must be complete before plumber fit-off** | The plumber cannot install fixtures (toilet, taps, basin) until tiling is complete and grout has cured. Fixtures installed on wet grout can shift, and silicone will not adhere to damp tiles. | Tiler finishes first; plumber follows | Tiling → 24-48 hour grout cure → Second fix plumbing |
| **Silicone sealant** | After second fix, silicone sealant is applied around fixtures (toilet base to floor, basin to vanity, bath to tiles). This is typically done by the plumber, though some tilers or builders do it. Silicone should be mould-resistant (bathroom-grade) and colour-matched to grout. | Plumber (usually) | After second fix |

### 6.3 Coordination with Cabinet Maker

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Sink cut-out positioning** | The cabinet maker needs to know the exact sink model, dimensions, and mounting type (drop-in, undermount, flush-mount) before finalising the cabinet design. The sink position determines: the cut-out in the benchtop (for drop-in or undermount), the internal cabinet dimensions (must accommodate the sink bowl depth and waste trap), and the location of pipe connections inside the cabinet. | Plumber provides sink specification; cabinet maker designs cabinet and benchtop around it | Design phase |
| **Dishwasher connection location** | The cabinet maker must leave adequate space (typically a 15mm gap) between the dishwasher cavity and the adjacent sink cabinet to allow water supply and waste hoses to pass through. A hole (typically 40-50mm) must be drilled through the partition wall of the cabinet for the hoses. | Cabinet maker drills access hole; plumber connects | Cabinet design + second fix |
| **Tap hole locations** | For vanity basins and laundry tubs, the tap hole position must be confirmed before the cabinet is manufactured (if the basin is integrated) or before the plumber installs (if a separate basin). | Cabinet maker (for integrated basins) or basin manufacturer | Design phase |
| **Waste pipe clearance inside cabinets** | The waste trap (P-trap or bottle trap) hangs below the basin inside the cabinet. The cabinet maker must ensure there is adequate depth below the basin to accommodate the trap without it interfering with drawers or shelving. Minimum clearance: 200mm below the basin waste outlet for a standard P-trap. | Plumber specifies; cabinet maker accommodates | Design phase |
| **Cabinet installation before plumber fit-off** | The cabinet must be installed, level, and secured to the wall before the plumber connects the basin, taps, and waste. The plumber cannot connect to a cabinet that is not yet in place. | Cabinet maker installs first; plumber follows | Cabinet installation → Second fix plumbing |

### 6.4 Coordination with Stone Mason

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Undermount sink positioning** | For stone benchtops with undermount sinks, the sink must be on site and available for the stonemason's template appointment. The stonemason templates the benchtop around the actual sink to ensure a precise cut-out. The sink is then bonded to the underside of the stone during benchtop installation. The plumber connects the waste and water supply AFTER the benchtop is installed and the adhesive has cured (minimum 24 hours). | Stonemason templates and installs; plumber connects after | Template day → Fabrication → Installation → Plumber 2 days later |
| **Tap hole locations** | The stonemason drills tap holes in the stone benchtop during fabrication (based on the template). The plumber must confirm the tap hole position and diameter BEFORE the template appointment. Once the stone is cut, changes are not possible without a new slab. | Plumber provides tap specs; stonemason drills | Before template day |
| **Support brackets for undermount sinks** | Heavy undermount sinks (e.g., fireclay, cast iron) may require support brackets mounted inside the cabinet to take the weight rather than relying solely on the adhesive bond to the stone. The plumber or builder installs these brackets. | Plumber or builder | After cabinet installation, before benchtop installation |
| **Benchtop adhesive cure time** | The resin or adhesive used to bond the stone benchtop to the cabinet substrate (and the undermount sink to the stone) needs at least 24 hours to cure. The plumber should NOT connect the sink or apply any downward force on the benchtop until the adhesive has fully cured. Best practice: book the plumber 2 days after benchtop installation. | Stonemason advises cure time; plumber schedules accordingly | After benchtop installation |
| **Hot water damage to stone** | Continuous contact of hot water pipes with certain stone types can cause discolouration or cracking. The plumber should ensure hot water supply pipes do not contact the underside of the stone benchtop directly. Use pipe insulation or maintain clearance. | Plumber responsibility | During second fix |

### 6.5 Coordination with Builder / Carpenter

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Floor penetrations** | Any new pipe or waste penetrations through timber or concrete floors must be agreed with the builder. In timber floors, penetrations through joists must not exceed 1/4 of the joist depth, and must be located in the middle third of the joist span (not near bearers or supports). Notching rules apply per AS 1684. In concrete slabs, the builder/structural engineer must approve penetrations to ensure they do not compromise slab integrity (especially post-tensioned slabs where cutting tendons is catastrophic). | Plumber requests; builder/engineer approves | Before rough-in |
| **Service chases** | If a wall or floor does not have a cavity deep enough to accommodate drainage pipes (e.g., a 100mm sewer pipe in a 90mm stud wall), the builder may need to create a service chase or build a box-out to conceal the pipe. Common in renovations where new drainage is being run through existing walls. | Plumber identifies need; builder constructs chase | During rough-in |
| **Access panels** | The builder installs access panels in walls or ceilings to provide future maintenance access to concealed plumbing components (isolation valves, in-wall cistern mechanisms, bath trap, shower mixer internals). Access panel locations must be agreed before wall close-up. | Plumber specifies locations; builder installs panels | After rough-in, during wall close-up |
| **Structural impacts** | If plumbing modifications require cutting through structural elements (beams, load-bearing studs, floor joists, concrete slabs), a structural engineer must assess the impact and provide a design solution. The builder coordinates this. | Builder leads; plumber provides details of required penetrations | Before rough-in |
| **Noggin installation** | The builder installs horizontal timber blocking (noggins) at the correct height in wall frames to support heavy plumbing fixtures: vanity brackets (if wall-hung), toilet cistern frame (in-wall cistern), shower rail mounting, grab rail mounting, heated towel rail mounting. The plumber must confirm mounting heights BEFORE the builder installs noggins. | Plumber provides heights; builder installs noggins | During framing, before plumbing rough-in |
| **Ceiling fixings** | If the plumber needs to run pipes through the ceiling space, the builder must ensure adequate ceiling height is maintained. Ceiling battens and fixings may need to be adjusted to accommodate pipes. | Both trades coordinate | During rough-in |

### 6.6 Coordination with Waterproofer

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Membrane timing** | The waterproofing membrane CANNOT be applied until ALL plumbing rough-in in the wet area is complete and inspected. This is a non-negotiable hold point. | Plumber completes first; waterproofer follows | Rough-in → Inspection → Waterproofing |
| **Penetration flashing** | Every plumbing penetration through the waterproofed zone must be sealed. The waterproofer uses proprietary flange systems (puddle flanges at floor wastes), pipe collars (around supply pipes penetrating walls), or liquid-applied membrane with reinforcing bandage (around pipe penetrations). | Waterproofer applies; plumber provides correctly positioned penetrations | During waterproofing |
| **Floor waste puddle flange** | The puddle flange must be installed by the plumber and rebated into the substrate BEFORE the waterproofer arrives. The waterproofer bonds the membrane to the puddle flange lip. | Plumber installs; waterproofer bonds membrane | Plumber: rough-in. Waterproofer: waterproofing |
| **Wall penetration height** | Shower mixer and tap penetrations must be at the correct height and firmly secured before the waterproofer seals around them. If a pipe moves after waterproofing, the seal is broken. | Plumber installs and secures; waterproofer seals | Rough-in → Waterproofing |
| **No plumbing work after waterproofing** | After the waterproofing membrane is applied and cured, NO plumbing work should penetrate or disturb the membrane. If changes are needed, the waterproofer must return to re-seal. | Both trades respect this rule | After waterproofing |
| **Waterproofing certificate** | The waterproofer issues a waterproofing certificate confirming compliance with AS 3740. This certificate must be obtained BEFORE tiling begins. It is also a pre-condition for the plumber's second fix -- the plumber should not install fixtures on surfaces that are not certified waterproof. | Waterproofer issues | After waterproofing, before tiling |

### 6.7 Coordination with Demolition

| Coordination Point | Detail | Who Leads | When |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Service isolation before demolition** | The plumber must cap/isolate all water supply lines, waste connections, and gas lines BEFORE demolition begins. This is a safety-critical step. Water left pressurised in pipes during demolition can cause flooding. Gas left connected during demolition is a fire/explosion risk. | Plumber isolates; demolition contractor proceeds | Before demolition |
| **What demo needs to happen before plumbing** | All fixtures (toilet, basin, bath, shower, sink, taps) must be disconnected and removed by the demolition team (or the plumber disconnects and the demo team removes). All wall linings (plasterboard, tiles, render) must be removed to expose wall frames and existing pipes. Floor coverings (tiles, vinyl) must be removed to expose the substrate. The space must be cleared of debris before the plumber can begin rough-in. | Demo contractor; plumber may disconnect fixtures | Demolition phase |
| **Preserving existing services** | If only part of the plumbing is being replaced (e.g., renovating one bathroom while the rest of the house remains connected), the plumber must cap the supply and waste connections to the renovation area while maintaining service to the rest of the house. This often requires a temporary arrangement (e.g., temporary toilet connection, temporary laundry taps). | Plumber manages | Before and during demolition |
| **Identifying existing pipe routes** | During demolition, existing pipe routes through walls and floors are revealed. The plumber should inspect these BEFORE final demolition is complete to understand the existing drainage layout and plan modifications. Demolition contractors should not cut or remove drainage pipes without the plumber's guidance. | Plumber inspects; demo contractor preserves critical pipes | During demolition |
| **Asbestos pipe lagging** | Older properties (pre-1990) may have asbestos lagging on hot water pipes. This must be identified and removed by a licensed asbestos removalist BEFORE the plumber works on those pipes. | Asbestos assessor identifies; asbestos removalist removes; plumber works after clearance | Before plumbing rough-in |

## 8. Common Sequencing Mistakes

These are the mistakes that the scope generator should flag and help homeowners avoid.

**Confidence: HIGH** (based on widespread trade consensus and documented renovation failures)

### 8.1 Plumbing-Specific Sequencing Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Consequence | How the Scope Generator Should Flag It |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Waterproofing done before plumbing rough-in is complete** | Membrane must be cut and patched for any missing plumbing penetrations. Risk of leak at every patched penetration. May require complete re-waterproofing ($1,000-$3,000+). | Flag waterproofing as a HOLD POINT in the scope with an explicit prerequisite: "All plumbing rough-in must be complete and inspected before waterproofing can commence." |
| 2 | **Floor waste set at wrong height** | If too high: tiles cannot be laid flush, water pools around the waste. If too low: waste sits in a depression, tiles slope too steeply. Either way: re-screeding and possibly re-waterproofing required. | Include a note in the plumbing scope: "Plumber to confirm floor waste height with tiler (accounting for tile thickness + adhesive + screed + membrane) before setting waste." |
| 3 | **Toilet set-out distance incorrect** | The toilet pan does not align with the waste pipe in the floor. Requires an offset pan connector (reduces flow efficiency, increases blockage risk) or, in worst case, repositioning the waste pipe (re-screeding, re-waterproofing, re-tiling). | Include in the plumbing scope: "Confirm toilet set-out distance (typically 140mm, 165mm, or 200mm) based on selected toilet model BEFORE rough-in." |
| 4 | **Tiling done before plumber fit-off of floor waste grate** | Tiles may cover or encroach on the floor waste opening. Tile-insert grate may not fit if tile layout was not coordinated with waste position. | Include in scope: "Tiler to coordinate floor waste grate positioning with plumber before commencing floor tiling." |
| 5 | **Plumber fit-off scheduled before tiling is complete** | Fixtures installed on un-grouted or un-cured tiles may shift. Grout and adhesive may contaminate new fixtures. Silicone will not adhere to damp tiles, leading to mould and water ingress behind fixtures. | Include in scope: "Plumber second fix to be scheduled minimum 48 hours after grouting is complete." |
| 6 | **Plumber fit-off scheduled before benchtop installation** (kitchen) | The sink and taps cannot be connected without the benchtop in place. Wasted visit and re-scheduling delay. | Include in scope: "Plumber second fix for kitchen sink and taps to be scheduled minimum 2 days after benchtop installation (adhesive cure time required)." |
| 7 | **Gas connection scheduled before gas pipe rough-in and testing** | Gas appliance cannot be commissioned without a tested and certified gas supply. Delay to kitchen completion. | Include gas rough-in and gas testing as separate line items in the scope, with gas appliance connection listed as a dependency. |
| 8 | **No temporary toilet provision during renovation** | If the only toilet in the house is being renovated, the occupants have no toilet for 4-6 weeks. This is a significant livability issue that is frequently overlooked. | Flag in the scope: "If renovating the only bathroom in the property, arrange temporary toilet facilities (portable toilet hire: approximately $150-$300/week)." |
| 9 | **Electrical rough-in done before plumbing rough-in** | Plumbing pipes are larger and less flexible than electrical cables. If electrical goes first, the plumber may need to reroute pipes around cables, or the electrician may need to move cables to accommodate pipes. Either way: rework and delay. | Include in scope: "Plumbing rough-in to be completed first or concurrently with electrical rough-in. Plumbing takes priority for shared wall cavities." |
| 10 | **Not ordering fixtures before rough-in** | The plumber cannot accurately position rough-in pipes without knowing the exact fixture models. Different taps have different pipe centres, different toilets have different set-outs, different shower mixers have different in-wall bodies. If fixtures are ordered after rough-in, there is a high risk of misalignment. | Include in scope: "All fixtures (toilet, tapware, shower mixer, vanity) must be selected and ordered BEFORE plumbing rough-in commences. Provide plumber with specification sheets for all fixtures." |

### 8.2 Coordination Mistakes Between Plumbing and Other Trades

| # | Mistake | Consequence | How the Scope Generator Should Flag It |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 11 | **Cabinet maker takes measurements before plumbing rough-in** | Plumbing positions (waste, water supply) not yet finalised. Cabinet design may not align with actual pipe positions, causing fitting issues during cabinet installation. | Include in scope: "Cabinet maker final site measure to be taken AFTER plumbing and electrical rough-in are complete and walls are plastered." |
| 12 | **Stonemason templates benchtop before cabinets are installed** | Template measurements are inaccurate. Benchtop may not fit, sink cut-out may be in the wrong position. New slab required (additional cost: $2,000-$5,000+ for stone benchtop). | Include in scope: "Benchtop template to be taken AFTER all cabinets are installed, level, and secured." |
| 13 | **Plumber and waterproofer not communicating about puddle flange type** | Waterproofer may not have the correct membrane product to bond to the specific puddle flange type used. Some membrane systems are only compatible with specific flange types. | Include in scope: "Plumber and waterproofer to confirm puddle flange type/brand compatibility before plumber installs floor waste." |
| 14 | **Builder closes walls before plumber and electrician sign off** | Concealed pipes and cables may have errors that are now invisible. If issues are found later (e.g., during waterproofing or at final inspection), walls must be opened at significant cost. | Include in scope: "Wall close-up (plastering) must NOT commence until plumber AND electrician have completed rough-in, tested all systems, and provided sign-off." |
| 15 | **Demolition contractor removes existing drainage without plumber guidance** | Critical drainage connections may be damaged or disconnected in a way that is difficult to repair. Existing pipe routes that could have been reused are destroyed, requiring new (more expensive) drainage work. | Include in scope: "Plumber to inspect existing drainage layout BEFORE demolition of floor coverings and wall linings. Plumber to advise demolition team which pipes to preserve and which to remove." |
| 16 | **Hot water system not sized or ordered before renovation starts** | If the hot water system is being relocated or upgraded (common in kitchen/bathroom renovations), the plumber needs the new unit on site during rough-in to position supply, waste, and electrical connections correctly. Late ordering adds weeks of delay. | Include in scope: "If hot water system is being replaced or relocated, confirm new unit model and order BEFORE plumbing rough-in. Plumber, electrician, and gas fitter (if gas HWS) to coordinate on installation requirements." |
| 17 | **Not accounting for drainage fall when relocating fixtures** | Moving a fixture further from the drainage stack requires a longer waste pipe run, which needs more fall (gradient). If there is insufficient height available (e.g., between the floor substrate and the ceiling of the floor below), the new position may not be feasible without raising the floor level or using a macerator pump. | Include in scope: "If relocating fixtures, plumber to confirm adequate fall is achievable for the new waste pipe run BEFORE finalising the layout." |
| 18 | **Ignoring the impact of fixture relocation on concrete slab floors** | Moving a toilet or shower on a concrete slab requires cutting the slab, excavating, laying new drainage, backfilling, and repairing the slab. This adds $2,000-$5,000+ to the plumbing cost and 2-3 days to the timeline. Homeowners frequently underestimate this. | Flag in the scope: "Property has a concrete slab floor. Relocating fixtures (toilet, shower, floor waste) will require concrete cutting and under-slab drainage work. Budget $2,000-$5,000 additional for slab work." |

### 8.3 Communication and Planning Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Consequence | How the Scope Generator Should Flag It |
|---|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 19 | **Not booking trades early enough** | Plumbers and electricians are in high demand. Good trades are often booked 4-8 weeks in advance. Last-minute bookings result in either delays (waiting for the preferred plumber) or hiring less experienced trades (higher risk of errors). | Include in scope: "Recommended lead time for booking plumber: 4-8 weeks before renovation start date." |
| 20 | **No pre-start meeting between all trades** | Without a pre-start meeting, each trade works from their own assumptions about fixture positions, sequence, and timing. Conflicts emerge on site, causing delays and finger-pointing. | Include in scope: "Pre-start coordination meeting recommended between plumber, electrician, waterproofer, tiler, and cabinet maker before demolition commences." |
| 21 | **Homeowner changes fixture selections mid-renovation** | Different fixtures have different rough-in dimensions. Changing the shower mixer brand after rough-in means the in-wall pipes may not align with the new mixer body. Changing the toilet model may mean a different set-out distance. Any change after rough-in potentially requires re-opening walls. | Include in scope: "All fixture selections must be finalised BEFORE plumbing rough-in. Changes after rough-in may require rework at additional cost." |
| 22 | **Not lodging required notifications** | Plumbing work that is not properly notified to the relevant authority (see Section 1.4) is non-compliant. This can cause issues with insurance claims, property sales, and council certifications. If discovered during a building inspection or property sale, rectification may be required. | Include in scope: "Plumber to lodge all required notifications (Notice of Work / Compliance Certificate) with [relevant state authority] within the required timeframe." |
