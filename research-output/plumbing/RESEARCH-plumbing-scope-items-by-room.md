## A. Kitchen Renovation

Kitchen plumbing in an Australian residential renovation encompasses water supply (hot and cold), sanitary drainage (waste), gas supply, and various specialty connections. The kitchen is second only to the bathroom in plumbing complexity during a renovation, and errors during kitchen plumbing rough-in are extremely costly to rectify once cabinetry and benchtops are installed.

**Key principle:** All plumbing work in Australia must be performed by a licensed plumber. A Compliance Certificate must be issued for all regulated plumbing work (value thresholds and specific requirements vary by state — see Section E for details). Unlicensed plumbing work is illegal in every Australian state and territory, voids home insurance, and can result in significant fines.

### A1. Sink Rough-In — New Position vs Existing Position

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The "rough-in" is the first-fix plumbing stage where water supply pipes (hot and cold) and the waste/drainage pipe are run to the sink location before cabinetry, benchtops, and finished walls are installed. The scope difference between keeping the sink in its existing position versus relocating it is one of the single biggest cost variables in kitchen plumbing. |
| **What it involves — Existing position (like-for-like)** | When the sink stays in the same location, the plumber connects new tapware and waste fittings to the existing supply and drainage points. This typically involves: replacing old isolation valves (mini stop cocks) with new quarter-turn ball valves on existing hot and cold supply pipes; replacing the waste trap and tailpiece to suit the new sink; checking the existing waste pipe condition and replacing if corroded or undersized; and fitting new flexible braided hose connectors from the isolation valves to the new mixer tap. Minimal wall or floor disruption. |
| **What it involves — New position (relocation)** | When the sink moves to a new location (common when changing kitchen layout, adding an island, or moving from a window wall to a peninsula), the plumber must: extend or re-route hot and cold water supply pipes from the nearest branch to the new sink position; run new waste pipe from the new sink location to the existing drain stack or main waste line, maintaining minimum fall (1:40 grade for DN50 pipe per AS/NZS 3500.2); potentially core-drill through the concrete slab if services need to run under-floor; install new isolation valves at the new position; cap off old supply and waste points at the former sink position; and ensure the new waste run can be adequately vented (may require an Air Admittance Valve if conventional venting is not feasible). Distance of relocation is the primary cost driver — every additional metre of pipe run adds cost and complexity. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Water supply:** 15mm (DN15) copper, PEX-a, PEX-b, or multilayer pipe for hot and cold branches to the sink. Isolation valves (mini stop cocks or quarter-turn ball valves) at each supply point — one hot, one cold. Flexible braided stainless steel connector hoses (typically 300-500mm length, 15mm BSP connections) from isolation valves to mixer tap. **Waste:** DN50 (50mm) PVC waste pipe is the Australian standard for kitchen sinks per AS/NZS 3500.2. P-trap or S-trap (40mm or 50mm depending on configuration — 50mm preferred for kitchen). Minimum 1:40 fall (25mm per metre) on the horizontal waste run. Maximum horizontal distance from trap to stack/drain connection depends on pipe diameter and venting arrangement. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every kitchen renovation requires sink plumbing. The scope difference (existing vs relocated) is the key variable. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Must comply with AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services) and AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary plumbing and drainage). New isolation valves are now mandatory immediately upstream of every flexible hose connection per AS/NZS 3500.1:2025. All new or modified pipework must be pressure-tested before concealment. Compliance Certificate required. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Assuming a sink relocation is trivial — even a 1-metre move can require significant pipe re-routing, especially through concrete slabs. (2) Not checking the fall on the waste pipe — insufficient fall causes slow drainage and blockages. (3) Forgetting to cap old service points properly. (4) Not coordinating rough-in positions with the kitchen designer/cabinet maker — rough-in heights and positions must match the new cabinetry exactly. (5) Using DN40 waste pipe instead of DN50 for a kitchen sink (DN50 is the Australian standard). (6) Not allowing for a dishwasher waste connection tee in the sink waste run. (7) Failing to replace old gate-type isolation valves with new quarter-turn ball valves during the renovation — the old valves frequently seize and fail. |

### A2. Sink Waste Connection

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The connection of the kitchen sink's waste outlet through a trap to the drainage system. This includes the trap type, pipe sizing, venting method, and connection to the building's main drain. |
| **What it involves** | Installing a waste trap directly below the sink (inside the base cabinet), connecting the trap outlet to the horizontal waste pipe run, and connecting that run to the existing drain stack or floor waste connection. The trap must maintain a water seal to prevent sewer gases entering the kitchen. The horizontal waste run must have adequate fall and be properly vented. |
| **Pipe sizing** | **DN50 (50mm)** is the standard kitchen sink waste pipe diameter in Australia per AS/NZS 3500.2. While some older installations and European sinks use DN40 (40mm), the Australian code requires DN50 for kitchen waste. If the sink has a European-style 40mm outlet (common with IKEA and imported sinks), a 40mm-to-50mm adapter is required at the trap outlet. The trap itself may be 40mm at the sink connection but must transition to 50mm at the outlet side. For a double-bowl sink, a single DN50 trap with a double-bowl waste kit is standard. |
| **Trap types** | **P-trap:** The most common configuration in Australian kitchens. The trap discharges horizontally through the wall (into a wall-mounted waste pipe). Preferred when the waste pipe runs through the wall cavity behind the sink. **S-trap:** The trap discharges vertically downward through the floor. Used when the waste pipe runs under the slab or through the floor. Common in older Australian homes and ground-floor slab-on-ground construction. **Bottle trap:** A compact cylindrical trap, sometimes used for aesthetic reasons in exposed vanity plumbing (more common in bathrooms). Generally not recommended for kitchen sinks due to higher blockage risk from food waste. All traps must maintain a minimum 50mm water seal per AS/NZS 3500.2. |
| **Venting — AAV vs conventional** | **Conventional venting:** The waste pipe is connected to a vent pipe that rises to the roofline, allowing air into the drainage system to prevent siphonage of trap water seals. This is the traditional and preferred method. **Air Admittance Valve (AAV):** Also called a "Studor vent" or "cheater vent." A mechanical one-way valve that allows air into the waste system when negative pressure occurs (during drainage) but seals to prevent sewer gas escape. AAVs are permitted under AS/NZS 3500.2 in specific circumstances — typically where it is impractical to run a conventional vent pipe to the roofline (e.g., island bench sinks, sinks far from the existing vent stack). AAVs must be installed above the flood level of the highest fixture they serve and must remain accessible for inspection and replacement. AAVs have a finite lifespan (typically 10-20 years) and will eventually need replacement. **Important:** AAV use is regulated and may not be permitted in all jurisdictions or by all local authorities. Check with your local water authority. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required for every kitchen sink installation. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.2:2025 — sanitary plumbing and drainage. DN50 minimum for kitchen sink waste. Trap must maintain minimum 50mm water seal. Horizontal waste runs must achieve minimum 1:40 fall for DN50 pipe (25mm per metre). Maximum length of unvented waste pipe depends on pipe diameter — for DN50, approximately 3.0m before a vent is required. AAVs must comply with AS/NZS 3500.2 and be WaterMark certified. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using DN40 pipe for the full waste run instead of DN50 (code non-compliant). (2) Insufficient fall on horizontal waste run — causes slow drainage, odour, and blockage. (3) Not providing adequate venting — leads to gurgling, slow drainage, and trap siphonage (loss of water seal = sewer gas entry). (4) Installing an AAV below the flood level of the fixture — it must be above. (5) Not allowing for future dishwasher waste connection (a tee or spigot on the waste pipe). (6) Failing to include a removable cleanout or inspection opening on long waste runs. (7) Not checking that the trap can physically fit inside the sink base cabinet — measure clearance before ordering. |

### A3. Hot and Cold Water Supply to Sink

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The supply of pressurised hot and cold water from the building's water supply system to the kitchen sink mixer tap or tap set. Includes the branch pipe runs, isolation valves, and flexible connectors to the tap. |
| **What it involves** | Running hot and cold water supply pipes from the nearest manifold or branch point to the sink location. Installing isolation valves (one hot, one cold) at the sink. Connecting flexible braided hose connectors from the isolation valves to the mixer tap inlets. If the sink is being relocated, this involves extending or re-routing supply pipes, which may require running pipes through wall cavities, under floors, or through the slab. |
| **Pipe sizing** | **DN15 (15mm)** is standard for individual fixture branches in Australian residential plumbing. This applies to both hot and cold supply lines to the kitchen sink. The main supply pipe entering the property is typically DN20 (20mm) or DN25 (25mm), reducing to DN15 at individual fixture branches. Pipe sizing must comply with AS/NZS 3500.1 — the plumber must calculate that the pipe sizing delivers adequate flow rate and pressure to the fixture. |
| **Pipe materials** | Three main options are used in Australian residential renovations: **Copper (Type B):** The traditional Australian standard. Soldered or press-fit joints. DN15 = 15mm OD with 0.91mm wall thickness per AS 1432. Excellent longevity (50-70 years). Higher material and labour cost. Required where pipes are exposed to UV light (e.g., external runs). **PEX (Cross-linked Polyethylene):** PEX-a (Engel method, most flexible) or PEX-b (Silane method, slightly stiffer). Joined using expansion fittings (PEX-a) or crimp/clamp rings (PEX-b). Highly flexible — can be run through cavities with fewer joints. Lower cost than copper. Must not be exposed to UV light. Must comply with AS/NZS 2492. **Multilayer (PEX-AL-PEX):** A composite pipe with PEX inner layer, aluminium core, and PEX outer layer. Combines flexibility of PEX with shape-holding ability of aluminium. Press-fit connections. Complies with AS 4176. Growing in popularity in Australian renovations. All pipe materials must be WaterMark certified for use in Australian plumbing. |
| **Isolation valves** | **Mandatory** at each fixture per AS/NZS 3500.1:2025. Must be quarter-turn ball valve type (not old-style gate valves). DN15 size to match supply pipes. Typically chrome-plated brass mini stop cocks. Must be accessible — installed inside the sink base cabinet where they can be reached without removing cabinetry. **Critical 2025 update:** AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 now mandates an isolation valve immediately upstream of every flexible hose connector. This means every braided hose connecting to a tap must have its own accessible isolation valve. |
| **Flexible connectors** | Braided stainless steel flexible hoses connect the isolation valves to the tap inlets. Typical length 300-500mm. Must comply with AS 3499:2022 (Water supply — flexible hose assemblies). **Important:** Flexible hoses are the number one cause of insurance claims from water damage in Australian homes. They have a finite lifespan (typically 10 years) and must be inspected regularly. The 2025 update to AS/NZS 3500.1 includes new provisions to reduce flexible hose failure risk. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required for every kitchen sink. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 (water services). All fittings must be WaterMark certified. Pressure test required on new or modified pipework (minimum 1500 kPa for 20 minutes, or as per current testing standard). Isolation valves mandatory at each fixture. Flexible hoses must comply with AS 3499:2022. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not replacing old gate valves with modern quarter-turn ball valves during the renovation — gate valves seize over time and are useless in an emergency. (2) Using non-WaterMark-certified fittings or cheap flexible hoses — these are the primary failure point. (3) Not pressure-testing new pipework before concealment behind walls. (4) Mixing incompatible pipe materials without proper transition fittings (e.g., connecting copper directly to galvanised without a dielectric union — causes electrolytic corrosion). (5) Running PEX through areas exposed to sunlight without UV protection. (6) Not insulating hot water pipes in wall cavities or under floors — leads to heat loss and wasted energy/water while waiting for hot water to arrive at the tap. (7) Not coordinating rough-in pipe positions with the kitchen designer — pipes must exit the wall at the exact position to align with the sink base cabinet. |

### A4. Dishwasher Connection

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The plumbing connections required for a dishwasher: cold water supply, waste water drainage, and (in some configurations) hot water supply. The dishwasher is typically located adjacent to the kitchen sink to share supply and drainage infrastructure. |
| **What it involves** | **Water supply:** Installing a dedicated cold water isolation valve (mini stop cock) branching off the cold water supply pipe, typically inside the adjacent sink base cabinet. The dishwasher's inlet hose connects to this valve. Some older Australian installations provided hot water supply to the dishwasher, but most modern dishwashers heat their own water and require cold supply only — always check the manufacturer's specifications. **Waste connection:** The dishwasher waste hose must connect to the kitchen sink waste system. This is typically done via a dishwasher spigot on the sink trap, a dedicated tee fitting on the waste pipe downstream of the trap, or a connection to the waste disposal unit (InSinkErator) if one is fitted. The waste hose must include a high loop (the hose must rise to near the underside of the benchtop before descending to the waste connection) to prevent backflow of waste water from the sink into the dishwasher. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Water supply:** DN15 cold water supply with dedicated quarter-turn isolation valve. Dishwasher inlet hose typically has a 3/4" BSP threaded connection to the valve. **Waste:** Dishwasher waste hose (supplied with the machine) is typically 19-22mm ID. Connects to a spigot on the sink waste trap or a dedicated waste fitting. The high loop must reach a minimum of 600mm above the floor (ideally to the underside of the benchtop) to prevent backflow. |
| **Backflow prevention** | In Australia, dishwasher waste connections must prevent backflow of waste water into the dishwasher. The high loop method is the most common residential approach. Some jurisdictions or plumbers may require an air gap device (a physical break in the waste hose above the flood level of the sink) for additional protection, though this is less common in Australian residential installations than in the US. The key requirement is that the waste hose rises above the flood level of the connected fixture (the sink) before descending to the drain connection. An air break or air gap at the discharge point to the drainage system is the preferred arrangement per AS/NZS 3500.2 for preventing cross-contamination. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — dishwashers are present in virtually every modern Australian kitchen renovation. Plumbing provisions should always be included even if the homeowner is not installing a dishwasher immediately. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water supply — isolation valve required). AS/NZS 3500.2 (waste connection — backflow prevention required). All fittings must be WaterMark certified. The dishwasher's water and waste connections should be accessible (inside the adjacent cabinet) for maintenance. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not providing a dedicated isolation valve for the dishwasher — makes future maintenance and emergency shutoff impossible without turning off the entire kitchen supply. (2) Not including a high loop on the waste hose — allows sink waste water to back up into the dishwasher, creating a health hazard and foul odour. (3) Connecting the dishwasher waste hose before (upstream of) the sink trap — waste water must connect after (downstream of) the trap. (4) Not checking whether the dishwasher requires cold or hot water supply — most modern machines require cold only, but some older or commercial models require hot. (5) Forgetting to allow space for the dishwasher connections in the adjacent cabinet — the isolation valve, waste spigot, and hoses need physical space. (6) Not coordinating the dishwasher position with the kitchen designer — the machine must be adjacent to (typically immediately left or right of) the sink. |

### A5. Gas Supply for Cooktop

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The supply of natural gas or LPG to a gas cooktop. This is one of the most safety-critical plumbing items in a kitchen renovation. All gas fitting work in Australia must be performed by a licensed gasfitter (or plumber with gasfitting endorsement/licence, depending on the state). |
| **What it involves** | Running a gas supply pipe from the gas meter (natural gas) or LPG cylinder/manifold to the cooktop location inside the kitchen. Installing an isolation valve (gas cock) accessible near the cooktop. Installing a bayonet fitting (quick-connect coupling) or a dedicated gas cock for the cooktop connection. Connecting the cooktop to the bayonet using a flexible gas hose (certified for the gas type). Performing a gas pressure and leak test. Issuing a Gas Compliance Certificate. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pipe sizing:** Determined by the cooktop's gas consumption (MJ/hr rating) and the length of the pipe run from the meter. For a typical residential gas cooktop (30-45 MJ/hr): DN15 (15mm) copper or PE pipe is usually sufficient for runs under 10m. DN20 (20mm) may be required for longer runs or where multiple gas appliances share the supply. Gas pipe sizing must be calculated per AS/NZS 5601.1:2022 to ensure adequate gas pressure at the appliance. **Pipe materials:** Copper (Type B per AS 1432) is standard for internal gas runs. PE (polyethylene) pipe for underground/external runs. Flexible gas connectors must comply with AS/NZS 5601.1 and be certified for the specific gas type (natural gas or LPG). Stainless steel braided flexible connectors are standard for the final connection from the bayonet to the appliance. **Bayonet fitting:** A quick-connect gas coupling typically installed in the cupboard beside or behind the cooktop. Must comply with AS/NZS 5601.1. The bayonet must be accessible but not in a position where it could be damaged. Must be at least 150mm from electrical outlets. **Isolation valve:** A quarter-turn gas cock (ball valve) must be installed on the gas supply pipe, accessible without moving the cooktop. Typically located in the adjacent cabinet or below the benchtop. Must be within 1m of the appliance and accessible at all times. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the kitchen includes a gas cooktop. If the renovation retains a gas cooktop, gas supply is standard. If switching from gas to induction/electric (increasingly common), the gas supply must be properly capped and decommissioned (see A6 below). |
| **Compliance requirements** | **AS/NZS 5601.1:2022** — Gas Installations — General Installations. This is the primary standard governing all gas fitting work in Australia. All gas work must be performed by a licensed gasfitter. A **Gas Compliance Certificate** must be issued upon completion — requirements vary by state: **NSW:** Certificate of Compliance for Gas Work (CCGW) must be issued within 5 business days. **VIC:** Compliance certificate lodged with Energy Safe Victoria (ESV). **QLD:** Form 4 Compliance Certificate. **SA/WA/TAS/ACT/NT:** Each has its own compliance certificate requirements — check with the relevant state/territory regulator. Gas pressure testing (leak test) must be performed on all new or modified gas installations. The gas installation must be tested for gas soundness before any appliance is connected. Ventilation requirements per NCC (National Construction Code) must be met — a gas cooktop requires adequate room ventilation and a rangehood (ducted to exterior is required if the cooktop is gas, in most circumstances). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not sizing the gas pipe correctly for the appliance's MJ/hr rating — undersized pipe causes low flame/poor performance. (2) Using non-compliant flexible connectors — expired or unapproved hoses are a fire and explosion hazard. (3) Not obtaining a Gas Compliance Certificate — this is a legal requirement and essential for insurance. (4) Locating the bayonet or isolation valve in an inaccessible position (e.g., behind fixed cabinetry). (5) Not ventilating the room adequately for gas combustion — NCC requires specific ventilation for gas cooktops. (6) Not checking if the existing gas meter has sufficient capacity for a new or upgraded cooktop (plus any other gas appliances in the home). (7) Forgetting to coordinate the gas point location with the kitchen designer — the gas connection must align with the cooktop position in the cabinetry. |

---

### A6. Gas to Induction/Electric Changeover (Capping Gas)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The decommissioning (capping) of the gas supply to a cooktop when the homeowner is switching from a gas cooktop to an induction or electric cooktop. This is one of the most common scope items in modern Australian kitchen renovations, driven by the electrification trend, government incentives, and the superior performance of modern induction cooktops. |
| **What it involves** | The licensed gasfitter must: disconnect the gas cooktop from the flexible connector and bayonet fitting; remove the bayonet fitting; cap the gas pipe using an approved gas-rated cap or plug (typically a brass cap with Teflon tape and leak-tested); test the capped pipe for gas soundness (leak test using approved leak detection fluid or electronic gas detector); label the capped point to indicate it is a decommissioned gas supply; issue a Gas Compliance Certificate for the capping work; remove the old flexible gas connector (it should not be left in the wall cavity). If the gas cooktop was the only gas appliance in the home and the homeowner wants to fully disconnect from gas, the gas meter can be removed by the gas distributor (this is a separate process involving the gas utility company, not the plumber). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Capping materials:** Brass cap (15mm or 20mm to match pipe size) with approved thread sealant. The cap must be accessible — it should not be buried behind fixed cabinetry or inside a wall cavity where it cannot be inspected. **Testing:** Capped pipe must be tested for gas soundness per AS/NZS 5601.1. Typically a standing pressure test — the capped section is pressurised and monitored for pressure drop over a specified period. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required when switching from gas to electric/induction cooktop. Becoming extremely common in Australian renovations. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 5601.1:2022. Licensed gasfitter required. Gas Compliance Certificate must be issued for the capping work. The capped point must be accessible for future inspection. If the gas meter is to be removed, contact the gas distributor (e.g., Jemena in NSW, Australian Gas Networks in SA, Multinet in VIC) — this is a separate application process. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Attempting to cap gas supply without a licensed gasfitter — illegal and extremely dangerous. (2) Not issuing a Gas Compliance Certificate — essential for insurance and future sale of the property. (3) Burying the capped gas point inside a sealed wall cavity where it cannot be inspected — the cap must remain accessible. (4) Not removing the old flexible gas connector from the wall cavity — leaving old hoses in cavities is poor practice. (5) Forgetting to factor in the electrical work required for the new induction cooktop — the new cooktop typically requires a dedicated 32A circuit from the switchboard (this is the electrician's scope, not the plumber's, but must be coordinated). (6) Not informing the gas utility that a gas appliance has been permanently removed — the homeowner may continue paying gas supply charges unnecessarily. |

### A7. Fridge Water Connection (Ice Maker / Water Dispenser)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A cold water supply connection for a refrigerator with a built-in ice maker and/or water dispenser. This is an increasingly common request in kitchen renovations, though many homeowners forget to include it in their scope. |
| **What it involves** | Running a small-diameter cold water supply pipe from the nearest cold water supply point (typically under the kitchen sink) to the fridge location. Installing a dedicated isolation valve at the fridge connection point. The fridge connects to this valve via a flexible hose (typically supplied with the fridge or purchased separately). The pipe run is usually through the base cabinet kick boards, through the wall cavity, or under the floor slab, depending on the relative positions of the sink and fridge. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pipe sizing:** 10mm (3/8") OD copper tube or 1/4" (6mm) PEX/nylon tube is standard for fridge water connections. This smaller pipe size is adequate because the flow rate is very low (the fridge fills a small reservoir). Some plumbers run a standard 15mm supply line and reduce at the fridge end. **Isolation valve:** A 1/4-turn ball valve sized to match the pipe (typically 10mm or 1/4"). Must be accessible — either behind the fridge (if the fridge can be pulled out easily) or in the adjacent cabinet. **Flexible connector:** A braided stainless steel hose or nylon tube, typically 1.5-2.0m long, from the isolation valve to the fridge inlet. Must comply with AS 3499:2022 if it is a braided hose. **Water filter (optional):** An inline water filter can be installed on the supply line to improve water quality for the ice maker and dispenser. Typically a 10" or 20" inline cartridge filter with 1/4" push-fit connections. Requires periodic replacement (every 6-12 months). |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — but should be provisioned (pipe run and valve installed, capped) during a renovation even if the current fridge does not have an ice maker. Retrofitting a fridge water connection after the kitchen is finished is disruptive and expensive. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services). Isolation valve required. All fittings must be WaterMark certified. If an inline filter is installed, it must be accessible for cartridge replacement. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Forgetting to provision a fridge water connection during the renovation — this is the number one regret for homeowners who later purchase a fridge with an ice maker. (2) Not installing an isolation valve — if the fridge hose leaks, there is no way to shut off the supply without turning off the entire kitchen or house supply. (3) Running the pipe in a location that gets pinched or kinked when the fridge is pushed back into position. (4) Using a self-piercing saddle valve (a valve that pierces the existing pipe) — these are unreliable, prone to leaking, and generally not compliant with Australian standards. A proper tee connection and ball valve must be used. (5) Not considering a water filter — fridge ice makers are sensitive to water quality, and mineral deposits can clog the small internal valves. |

### A8. Waste Disposal Unit (InSinkErator) Connection

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The plumbing connection for a food waste disposal unit (commonly known by the brand name InSinkErator) installed in the kitchen sink drain. The unit grinds food waste into fine particles that flush through the drainage system. |
| **What it involves** | The waste disposal unit mounts directly to the sink drain outlet (replacing the standard sink waste fitting). It requires both a plumbing connection (waste pipe from the unit's discharge to the sink trap and drain) and an electrical connection (a switched power point or hardwired connection under the sink — this is the electrician's scope). The plumber's scope includes: removing the existing sink waste fitting; installing the disposal unit mounting assembly to the sink drain; connecting the unit's discharge tube to the waste trap; adjusting the trap and waste pipe configuration to accommodate the unit; and if a dishwasher is present, connecting the dishwasher waste hose to the disposal unit's dishwasher inlet port. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Waste connection:** The unit's discharge tube (typically supplied as a straight tube) connects to the existing P-trap or S-trap. Discharge tube is approximately 38mm (1.5") — an adapter may be required to connect to the Australian standard DN50 trap. The unit must be installed using the supplied spring-type hose clamp per the manufacturer's instructions. Per Australian requirements, the supplied straight discharge tube must be used (not aftermarket). **Power:** Most units require a standard 10A switched GPO under the sink, or a pneumatic air switch mounted on the benchtop (the air switch is preferred — no electrical contact near water). Some units are hardwired. Electrical scope is covered by the electrician. **Unit sizing:** Residential units are typically 0.55-0.75 HP (InSinkErator M56, M66, Evolution 100, or equivalent). |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — increasingly common in Australian kitchen renovations, but not included by default. Must be specifically requested by the homeowner. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Must be installed to AS/NZS 3500.2 standard requirements. The unit may require approval from the relevant local water authority or sewerage system operator — some councils restrict or prohibit waste disposal units (check local regulations). WaterMark certification required for the plumbing components. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not checking with the local water authority or council whether waste disposal units are permitted — some areas prohibit them due to impacts on the sewerage system. (2) Not providing an electrical connection under the sink (this must be coordinated with the electrician during rough-in). (3) Not adjusting the waste trap position/height to accommodate the disposal unit — the unit adds approximately 150-200mm of depth below the sink, reducing clearance in the base cabinet. (4) Connecting the dishwasher waste hose to the disposal unit but forgetting to remove the internal knockout plug on the unit's dishwasher inlet port (a common installation error that blocks the dishwasher from draining). (5) Not using the manufacturer-supplied discharge tube and clamp — aftermarket fittings may leak or void warranty. |

### A9. Island Bench Plumbing (Running Services Through Floor/Slab)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The installation of plumbing services (water supply, waste drainage, and potentially gas) to a kitchen island bench that is not positioned against a wall. This requires running all services through the floor — which, in most Australian homes, means penetrating or routing through a concrete slab. This is one of the most complex and expensive plumbing scope items in a kitchen renovation. |
| **What it involves** | **Core drilling / slab cutting:** A concrete cutting contractor core-drills penetrations through the concrete slab at the island location for water supply pipes and the waste pipe. Core holes are typically 50-100mm diameter for individual service penetrations, or a larger chase may be cut if multiple services need to pass through. For post-tensioned slabs (common in newer apartments and some houses), core drilling is extremely risky — a structural engineer must be consulted to identify cable locations before any drilling. Hitting a post-tension cable can cause catastrophic structural failure. **Water supply:** Hot and cold supply pipes are run under the slab (through the ground) from the nearest supply point to emerge through the slab penetration at the island. Alternatively, if the slab is very thick or difficult to penetrate, pipes can be run through the floor cavity (if there is one — rare in slab-on-ground construction) or along the base of adjacent walls and then across the floor inside the kickboard space. **Waste drainage:** A DN50 waste pipe is run under the slab from the island sink position to the nearest drain connection point (typically the existing kitchen drain). This is the critical challenge — the waste pipe must maintain minimum 1:40 fall (25mm per metre) for the entire run. If the existing drain connection is far from the island, there may not be enough depth under the slab to achieve adequate fall. A plumber must assess this before the kitchen design is finalised. **Venting:** Because the island sink is far from the existing vent stack, conventional venting is usually impractical. An Air Admittance Valve (AAV) is the standard solution for island sink venting in Australian residential renovations. The AAV is installed inside the island cabinetry, above the flood level of the sink. **Gas (if applicable):** If the island includes a gas cooktop, a gas supply pipe must also be run through the slab penetrations. This adds further complexity and cost. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Core drilling:** 50mm, 75mm, or 100mm diameter cores depending on the number and size of services. Must be diamond-core drilled (not jackhammered) to avoid slab damage. Depth depends on slab thickness (typically 100-200mm for residential slabs). **Under-slab pipework:** Copper or PEX for water supply. PVC for waste (DN50). All under-slab pipes should be sleeved (run through a larger-diameter protective conduit) to allow for future replacement without re-cutting the slab. **Fall calculation:** Waste pipe DN50 requires minimum 1:40 fall = 25mm per metre. For a 3-metre run, the pipe drops 75mm. For a 5-metre run, it drops 125mm. The plumber must verify there is sufficient depth below the slab for this fall before committing to the island sink position. |
| **Alternative: greywater pump system** | If achieving adequate fall for gravity drainage is impossible (e.g., the slab is too thin, the distance too great, or the existing drain is at the wrong level), a greywater pump (also called a macerator or sanitary pump — e.g., SFA Sanivite or SaniFlo) can be installed. The pump sits inside the island cabinetry and mechanically pumps waste water from the sink to the drain connection, even against gravity. Disadvantages: noise, mechanical failure risk, power dependency, and ongoing maintenance. Advantages: eliminates the need for deep slab cutting and fall calculations. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required when a kitchen island includes a sink or dishwasher. If the island has only a cooktop and no water services, island plumbing is not required (but gas may still need to run through the slab). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 and 3500.2. Core drilling into a concrete slab may require structural assessment, especially for post-tensioned or waffle-pod slabs. If the building is a strata-titled apartment, body corporate approval is typically required before any slab penetration. Building approval (CDC or DA) may be required depending on the scope of slab modifications and the local council. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not checking the slab type before designing the island — post-tensioned slabs are extremely dangerous to core-drill without a cable scan. (2) Designing the island sink position without checking that adequate waste fall can be achieved — if the fall doesn't work, the island sink is not feasible (or requires a pump). (3) Not sleeving under-slab pipes — if a pipe fails in 15 years, it cannot be replaced without re-cutting the slab unless it is in a sleeve. (4) Underestimating the cost — island plumbing through a slab typically adds $2,000-$5,000+ to the plumbing scope (core drilling alone can cost $500-$1,500). (5) Forgetting to include an AAV for the island sink waste — without proper venting, the island sink will drain slowly and the trap may siphon. (6) Not sealing slab penetrations after pipe installation — unsealed cores allow moisture and pest ingress. (7) In apartments, not obtaining body corporate approval before cutting into common property (the slab). |

### A10. Under-Sink Water Filter Provisions

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Plumbing provisions for an under-sink water filtration system. These systems filter the cold water supply before it reaches the tap, removing chlorine, sediment, heavy metals, and other contaminants. Popular brands in Australia include Puretec, 3M Aqua-Pure, Doulton, and Brita. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs: a tee fitting on the cold water supply pipe under the sink to divert water to the filter system; the filter housing/bracket mounted inside the sink base cabinet; supply and return lines from the tee to the filter and from the filter to either the main mixer tap (if a single-tap filtered water system) or a dedicated filter tap (a separate small tap on the benchtop that dispenses filtered water only). If a dedicated filter tap is used, a hole must be drilled in the benchtop (coordinated with the stone mason or cabinet maker). The filter bracket must be positioned so that filter cartridges can be easily changed (every 6-12 months typically). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pipe sizing:** 10mm or 15mm supply lines from the tee to the filter. **Filter tap:** If a dedicated filter tap is used, it is typically a separate goose-neck or swan-neck tap with a 35mm or 40mm benchtop hole. **Benchtop penetration:** One additional hole in the benchtop (35-40mm diameter) — must be coordinated with the stone mason during templating if stone benchtops are being installed. **Filter types:** Carbon block (most common for taste/chlorine removal), sediment filter, or multi-stage systems (sediment + carbon + UV). UV filtration systems also require an electrical connection. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — but provisions (a tee on the cold supply, a capped outlet, and space allocation in the cabinet) should be included during a renovation to avoid costly retrofitting later. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1. Filter systems must be WaterMark certified. The dedicated filter tap (if used) must comply with AS/NZS 3718 (Water supply — Tap ware). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not provisioning for a water filter during the renovation — retrofitting requires removing the mixer tap and modifying the plumbing under the sink. (2) Not allocating physical space in the base cabinet for the filter housing (it takes up approximately 100mm x 100mm x 350mm). (3) Not coordinating the additional benchtop hole for a dedicated filter tap with the stone mason before templating — adding a hole to an installed stone benchtop is expensive and risky. (4) Forgetting that the filter cartridge must be accessible for periodic replacement — do not bury the filter behind other plumbing. |

### A11. Instant Boiling Water Unit (Zip HydroTap / Billi)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Plumbing and installation provisions for an instant boiling water, chilled water, and/or sparkling water unit. The two dominant brands in Australia are **Zip (HydroTap)** and **Billi**. These units replace or supplement the standard kitchen mixer tap and provide instant filtered boiling, chilled, and optionally sparkling water on demand. |
| **What it involves** | These units consist of two main components: (1) a specialised tap/font that mounts on the benchtop (or sink), and (2) an under-bench unit (the heating/chilling/filtration system) that sits inside the sink base cabinet. The plumber's scope includes: installing the tap/font through the benchtop (requires a specific-diameter hole — typically 35-50mm depending on model); connecting the cold water supply to the under-bench unit via a dedicated isolation valve; connecting the waste/overflow drain from the under-bench unit to the sink waste or a dedicated drain; installing the under-bench unit in the cabinet with adequate ventilation (the unit generates heat). The electrician's scope includes: providing a dedicated power point (typically 10A or 15A, depending on model) inside the cabinet for the under-bench unit. Zip and Billi both offer certified installation services (Zip has over 100 certified engineers across Australian metro areas). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Water supply:** DN15 cold water supply with a dedicated isolation valve. Must have suitable power and water available within 1 metre of the installation position. **Waste:** A small-diameter (typically 12-19mm) drain hose from the under-bench unit to the sink waste trap or a nearby drain. This is for overflow and condensate drainage. **Benchtop penetration:** 35-50mm diameter hole (varies by model — check manufacturer specifications). Must be coordinated with the stone mason during templating. **Power:** Typically a dedicated 10A GPO inside the cabinet. Some larger commercial models require a 15A circuit. **Ventilation:** The under-bench unit generates heat and requires adequate airflow inside the cabinet. Some models require a ventilation grille or gap in the cabinet back. **Filtration:** The units include built-in water filtration (0.2 micron or similar). Filter replacement is typically every 6-12 months (included in manufacturer service contracts). |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — premium kitchen feature. Increasingly common in mid-to-high-end Australian kitchen renovations. Unit cost ranges from $2,500-$7,000+ depending on model and features. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water supply). The unit itself must be WaterMark certified. Professional installation is strongly recommended (and required by some manufacturers to maintain warranty). Zip's warranty requires installation by a Zip-certified engineer or qualified plumber. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not planning for the under-bench unit during kitchen design — it requires significant cabinet space (approximately 400mm x 300mm x 500mm or more). (2) Not coordinating the benchtop hole with the stone mason — each model has a specific hole size and location requirement. (3) Not providing adequate ventilation for the under-bench unit — it generates heat and will overheat in a sealed cabinet. (4) Not allowing for a waste drain connection — the unit produces condensate and overflow water that must be drained. (5) Choosing a unit without considering the ongoing maintenance costs — filter replacements and annual servicing are required ($150-$400/year depending on model and service plan). (6) Not providing a dedicated electrical outlet (electrician coordination). |

### A12. Relocating Sink Waste — Through Floor vs Through Wall

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The decision and associated scope of routing the kitchen sink waste (drainage) pipe either through the wall cavity to a vertical drain stack, or through the floor slab to an under-slab drainage connection. This decision is fundamental to the plumbing layout and is determined by the existing drainage infrastructure, the sink's new position, and the building construction type. |
| **What it involves** | **Through wall (P-trap configuration):** The waste pipe exits the P-trap horizontally and runs through the wall cavity to a vertical drain stack or branch drain within the wall. This is the simpler and preferred option when the sink is positioned against an external or internal wall that contains (or can contain) the drain stack. **Through floor (S-trap configuration):** The waste pipe exits the S-trap vertically downward through the floor. In slab-on-ground construction (the majority of Australian residential construction), this means the waste pipe must penetrate the concrete slab and connect to the under-slab drainage network. In homes with a raised timber floor (stumped construction, common in older QLD and some NSW/VIC homes), the pipe drops through the floor into the subfloor space and connects to the drainage system running under the house. |
| **Scope implications** | **Through wall** is generally simpler, less expensive, and less disruptive. It requires adequate wall cavity depth and a nearby drain stack. **Through floor on slab-on-ground** is more complex and expensive: requires core-drilling through the slab, excavation under the slab to lay new drainage pipe, connection to the existing under-slab drainage network, and re-sealing/patching the slab penetration. This can add $1,000-$3,000+ to the plumbing scope. **Through floor on raised timber floor** is intermediate: the pipe drops through the floorboards into the subfloor space, where it connects to the under-floor drainage. This is easier than slab work but still requires access to the subfloor and adequate fall to the drain connection. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every kitchen sink requires either a wall or floor waste connection. The choice between them is determined by the building's construction and existing drainage layout. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Assuming a through-wall connection is possible when there is no drain stack in the adjacent wall — the plumber must verify the drainage layout before the kitchen designer finalises the layout. (2) Not checking slab depth and under-slab drainage layout before committing to a through-floor connection on a slab-on-ground. (3) In apartments, attempting to run waste through the floor without checking the slab structure and obtaining body corporate approval. (4) Not waterproofing/sealing the slab penetration after installation — moisture can wick up through unsealed core holes. |

## B. Bathroom Renovation

Bathroom plumbing is the most complex and compliance-heavy plumbing scope in a residential renovation. It involves water supply (hot and cold), sanitary drainage (multiple fixtures with different waste sizes and trap types), gas (if hydronic heating is involved), tempering/thermostatic mixing valves (mandatory for personal hygiene fixtures), and critical coordination with waterproofing — which must occur between the plumbing rough-in and the tiling stages.

**Critical sequencing note:** In a bathroom renovation, the plumber visits the site at least twice and sometimes three or four times:
1. **First fix / rough-in** — before waterproofing: all in-wall and in-floor pipework, shower mixer bodies, waste outlets, puddle flanges, and floor waste grates are installed. This work must be pressure-tested and signed off before the waterproofer commences.
2. **Post-waterproofing / pre-tile** — the plumber must return to install puddle flanges and floor waste grates that sit on top of the waterproof membrane (in some configurations). The waterproofer must work around these elements.
3. **Second fix / fit-off** — after tiling is complete: all visible fixtures are connected — toilet pan, cistern (or concealed cistern activation), vanity basin and tapware, shower head and arm, bath spout and mixer, heated towel rail, accessories. This is the final plumbing stage.
4. **Commissioning** — flow testing, checking for leaks, adjusting tempering valves, and issuing the Compliance Certificate.

### B1. Shower Rough-In

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The first-fix installation of all concealed (in-wall) shower plumbing: the mixer valve body, hot and cold water supply pipes to the mixer, and the rough-in for the shower arm/rose outlet. All of this work must be completed and pressure-tested before waterproofing commences. |
| **What it involves** | **Mixer valve body:** The plumber installs the shower mixer valve body (the internal mechanism of the shower mixer) inside the wall cavity. The body is secured to the wall framing (timber noggin or metal bracket) at the correct depth so that the finished mixer face plate sits flush with the tiled wall surface. This requires knowing the combined thickness of the substrate (Villaboard/cement sheet — typically 6mm or 9mm), waterproofing membrane (1-2mm), tile adhesive (3-5mm), and tile (8-12mm). Total build-up is typically 20-30mm from the face of the substrate. The mixer body must be set at this depth. **Hot and cold supply:** DN15 (15mm) hot and cold supply pipes are run to the mixer body from the manifold or branch point. Copper, PEX, or multilayer pipe. **Shower arm outlet:** A 1/2" BSP threaded elbow or drop-ear elbow is installed in the wall at the shower arm position (typically directly above the mixer, at the desired shower rose height). This is secured to the wall framing and will receive the shower arm after tiling. **Height positioning:** The shower mixer centre is typically installed at **1000-1100mm** above finished floor level (AFL). The shower arm/rose outlet is typically installed at **1900-2100mm** AFL for a standard-height shower rose, or **2200-2400mm** AFL for a rain shower head. The homeowner and/or designer should confirm these heights before the plumber installs, as they cannot be changed after tiling without major rework. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Mixer valve body:** Must be compatible with the selected shower mixer brand/model. Common brands in Australian renovations: Methven, Phoenix, Caroma, Fienza, Sussex, Milli, ABI. Universal mixer bodies (e.g., Clark Universal Body) can accommodate multiple mixer brands. The body includes the cartridge housing and hot/cold inlets (typically 1/2" BSP or 15mm compression). **Supply pipes:** DN15 copper, PEX, or multilayer. **Shower arm outlet:** 1/2" BSP female threaded drop-ear elbow, secured to a timber noggin with screws. **Pressure test:** All rough-in pipework must be pressure-tested to 1500 kPa (or as per current testing standard) for a minimum of 20 minutes before waterproofing commences. |
| **Niche position considerations** | If the shower design includes a recessed niche (a built-in shelf in the shower wall for shampoo/soap), the plumber must be aware of the niche position during rough-in. Pipes must not run through the area where the niche will be cut into the wall. The wall framing for the niche (typically a timber or metal frame set between studs) must be installed at rough-in stage, and the plumber must route pipes around it. The niche is typically 300-600mm wide and 300-400mm high, positioned at 900-1200mm AFL. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required in every bathroom renovation that includes a shower. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services). Pressure testing mandatory before concealment. Mixer body must accommodate a tempering valve or thermostatic cartridge (see B8 below). All fittings WaterMark certified. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Setting the mixer body at the wrong depth — if too deep, the faceplate cannot reach the tiled surface; if too shallow, it protrudes and cannot be covered by the faceplate. The plumber must know the total wall build-up thickness (substrate + membrane + adhesive + tile) before setting the mixer body depth. (2) Not confirming shower mixer height with the homeowner/designer before installation — "standard" height varies, and tall or short users may want adjustments. (3) Not confirming the shower arm height and whether it is for a standard shower rose or a rain shower head (significantly different heights). (4) Running pipes through the niche area — forces a redesign of either the plumbing or the niche. (5) Not securing the mixer body firmly to the framing — over time, a loose body causes the mixer to wobble and can damage the waterproof membrane behind it. (6) Installing a mixer body that is not compatible with the selected mixer brand — verify the body and mixer are compatible before ordering. (7) Forgetting to pressure-test before waterproofing — once the membrane is applied, leaks in the rough-in cannot be detected until water damage appears (weeks, months, or years later). |

### B2. Shower Waste (Floor Waste Grate)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The shower floor waste is the drain point in the shower floor through which water exits to the drainage system. It includes the puddle flange (a wide flange that sits on the waterproof membrane and creates a waterproof seal at the drain penetration), the waste body (the pipe fitting that connects to the drainage system below), and the grate (the visible cover that sits flush with the tiled floor). |
| **What it involves** | **During rough-in (before waterproofing):** The plumber installs the waste body in the correct position in the shower floor. In slab-on-ground construction, this typically involves core-drilling through the concrete slab (if the waste is being relocated) or connecting to the existing waste penetration. The waste body must be set at the correct height to accommodate the screed/mortar bed and tile thickness above. **During/after waterproofing:** The puddle flange is installed over the waste body and clamped to the waterproof membrane. The waterproofer bonds the membrane to the puddle flange. This is a critical junction — failure here is the most common cause of shower leaks in Australian bathrooms. **After tiling:** The grate is installed on top of the waste body, sitting flush with the finished tile surface. |
| **Position considerations** | **Centre drain (traditional):** The waste grate is positioned in the centre of the shower floor. The shower floor is screeded with a fall from all four sides toward the centre drain. Minimum fall: 1:80 (12.5mm per metre). Maximum fall: 1:50 (20mm per metre) per AS 3740:2021. This four-way fall makes large-format tiles difficult to use (the tiles must be cut into triangular sections to achieve the fall from all directions). **Linear drain (modern):** A long, narrow channel drain positioned along one wall of the shower (typically the back wall or the shower entry side). The shower floor slopes in a single direction (one-way fall) toward the linear drain. This allows large-format tiles to be used without cutting into triangles. Linear drains are more expensive (both the product and the installation) but are the dominant choice in modern Australian bathroom renovations. **Tile insert grate:** A grate with a recessed tray that holds a piece of the same tile as the shower floor, making the drain nearly invisible. Available for both centre drains (square tile insert) and linear drains (long tile insert channel). Popular brands: Stormtech, Lauxes, Phoenix, Meir. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Centre drain:** 80mm or 100mm (DN80/DN100) waste body. Square grate typically 115mm x 115mm or 150mm x 150mm. PVC body. Puddle flange with clamping ring. **Linear drain:** Channel width typically 65-100mm, length 600-1200mm (must span the full width of the shower for proper drainage). Stainless steel or brass channel body. Tile insert or patterned grate. DN50 or DN80 outlet connection to the drainage pipe below. Flow rate: minimum 30-40 litres per minute (must handle the maximum shower flow rate). **Puddle flange:** PVC or stainless steel. Must be compatible with the waterproofing membrane system. Must create a watertight seal when clamped. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every shower must have a floor waste. The choice between centre drain, linear drain, and tile insert is a design/optional decision, but a drain is mandatory. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary plumbing and drainage). AS 3740:2021 (waterproofing — the puddle flange is a critical waterproofing element). Floor fall requirements: minimum 1:80, maximum 1:50. The grate must be WaterMark certified. The waste must be trapped (water seal to prevent sewer gas). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Positioning the centre drain off-centre — if the drain is not precisely centred, the four-way fall will be uneven, causing water to pool in low spots. (2) Not achieving adequate fall — water pools on the shower floor instead of draining. This is a screeding/tiling issue but starts with the plumber setting the waste body at the correct height. (3) Incorrect puddle flange installation — if the membrane is not properly bonded to the puddle flange, water will leak through the floor (the number one cause of shower leaks). (4) Choosing a linear drain that is too short — if the drain does not span the full width of the shower, water will flow around the ends and pool. (5) Not verifying the linear drain's flow rate is adequate for the shower head's flow rate — a high-flow rain shower head can overwhelm an undersized linear drain. (6) Not installing a hair trap/strainer in the waste — hair is the primary cause of shower drain blockages. (7) Setting the waste body at the wrong height — if it is too high, the grate sits above the tile surface; if too low, the grate sits in a recess that collects water and dirt. |

### B3. Bath Rough-In (Freestanding vs Built-In)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The first-fix plumbing installation for a bathtub, including the water supply (hot and cold), the waste and overflow connection, and the spout/mixer connection. The plumbing scope varies dramatically depending on the bath type (freestanding vs built-in) and the spout type (wall-mounted vs floor-mounted). |
| **What it involves — Built-in (alcove or drop-in) bath** | **Water supply:** Hot and cold supply pipes (DN15) are run through the wall cavity to the spout and mixer position (typically wall-mounted). The mixer body is installed in the wall at the rough-in stage (similar to the shower mixer). The spout outlet (typically a 1/2" BSP threaded elbow) is installed in the wall at the desired height (typically 150-200mm above the bath rim). **Waste and overflow:** The bath waste is typically DN40 (40mm) and connects via a trap (P-trap or S-trap) to the drainage system. The overflow is a secondary drain near the top of the bath that prevents overfilling — it connects to the waste pipe upstream of the trap. A combined waste and overflow (pop-up waste with overflow) is the standard fitting. The bath must have adequate access to the waste trap for maintenance — an access panel in the adjacent wall is best practice. |
| **What it involves — Freestanding bath** | **Water supply — wall-mounted spout (bath against wall):** If the freestanding bath is positioned against a wall, the plumber installs a wall-mounted spout and mixer in the wall above the bath rim, similar to a built-in bath. This is the simpler and cheaper option. **Water supply — floor-mounted spout (bath away from wall):** If the freestanding bath is positioned away from the wall (in the centre of the room or away from walls), the water supply must be brought through the floor to a floor-mounted bath mixer/spout. This requires: running hot and cold supply pipes under the floor (through the slab or subfloor) to the exact position of the floor-mounted spout; core-drilling slab penetrations if on a concrete slab; and installing the floor-mounted mixer's rough-in body before the floor is waterproofed and tiled. The floor-mounted spout rough-in body must be positioned precisely to align with the bath's inlet position. **Waste and overflow:** Freestanding bath waste exits through the base of the bath, typically via a flexible waste hose that connects to a floor-level waste connection. The waste pipe runs through the floor (slab penetration or subfloor). The waste trap must be accessible — in slab-on-ground construction, the trap is often located under the slab and can only be accessed by cutting the slab. Some modern freestanding baths include a pop-up waste that incorporates an inline trap within the bath itself, reducing the need for an accessible external trap. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Water supply:** DN15 copper, PEX, or multilayer. **Waste:** DN40 (40mm) PVC or chrome. Pop-up or plug waste fitting. Combined waste and overflow. P-trap or S-trap (40mm). **Floor-mounted spout rough-in:** The rough-in body is a brass or copper assembly that is embedded in the floor, with hot and cold connections below floor level and the spout connection above floor level. Must be set at the correct height for the finished floor surface. Typical floor-mounted mixers: Phoenix, Meir, Sussex, Caroma Urbane II. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the bathroom includes a bath. Not all bathrooms have baths (many modern Australian bathrooms are shower-only, especially in apartments and secondary bathrooms). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services). AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary drainage). The bath spout outlet must incorporate an air gap above the flood level of the bath to prevent backflow (the spout must be above the bath rim). Tempering valve required on the hot water supply to the bath (see B8). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not confirming the bath type (freestanding vs built-in) and spout type (wall vs floor) before rough-in — changing after rough-in requires complete pipe re-routing. (2) For floor-mounted spouts: not knowing the exact bath position and floor-mounted spout rough-in position before the slab is poured/drilled — the rough-in must be precise. (3) Not providing a waste access panel for built-in baths — when the waste trap blocks, there must be a way to access it without demolishing the bath surround. (4) Not checking that the freestanding bath waste can connect to the floor waste — some freestanding bath waste outlets are offset from the slab penetration, requiring flexible waste hose routing. (5) Not allowing for a tempering valve on the bath supply — this is a mandatory requirement. (6) For floor-mounted spouts on concrete slabs: underestimating the cost and complexity of slab penetrations — similar to island bench plumbing, this adds significant cost. |

### B4. Vanity/Basin Rough-In

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The first-fix and second-fix plumbing for the bathroom vanity basin, including hot and cold water supply, waste connection, and the configuration differences between wall-hung and floor-standing vanities, and single vs double basin setups. |
| **What it involves** | **Water supply:** Hot and cold supply pipes (DN15) to the basin mixer tap, with isolation valves at each supply point. For a wall-hung vanity, supply pipes must exit the wall at the correct height (typically 500-550mm AFL for a standard wall-hung vanity at 850mm bench height). For a floor-standing vanity, supply pipes exit the wall at the base of the vanity or through the floor (lower position, as the pipes are concealed behind the vanity cabinet). **Waste connection:** Basin waste pipe is typically DN40 (40mm) in Australia. The waste exits via a P-trap (through the wall) or S-trap (through the floor). The trap type depends on the vanity type and the building's drainage layout. For wall-hung vanities, the waste must exit through the wall (P-trap) — an S-trap going through the floor would be visible below the vanity. For floor-standing vanities, either P-trap or S-trap can be used (both are concealed inside the cabinet). **Double basin:** For a double-basin vanity, each basin requires its own trap and waste connection. The two waste pipes typically join into a single DN40 or DN50 waste pipe before connecting to the drain. Each basin requires its own hot and cold supply with isolation valves. |
| **Trap types for basins** | **P-trap:** Most common for wall-hung vanities. The trap sits below the basin and discharges horizontally through the wall. If the vanity is wall-hung and the P-trap is exposed (not inside a cabinet), a chrome bottle trap or chrome P-trap may be used for aesthetic reasons. **S-trap:** Common for floor-standing vanities where the waste pipe goes through the floor. The trap sits below the basin and discharges vertically downward. **Bottle trap:** A compact, cylindrical trap used for aesthetic reasons when the trap is visible (e.g., under a wall-hung basin without a cabinet). More prone to blockage than a standard P-trap due to the smaller internal waterway. Must still maintain a 50mm water seal per AS/NZS 3500.2. |
| **Wall-hung vs floor-standing considerations** | **Wall-hung vanity:** All plumbing connections (supply and waste) must exit the wall at precise heights and positions — there is no floor-level cabinet to conceal pipes. The pipe positions must align with the vanity's internal service holes (typically marked on the vanity's installation template). If the vanity is open-shelf style (no doors), the plumbing is fully visible and must be neat — chrome traps and valves are standard. **Floor-standing vanity:** Plumbing connections can exit the wall at lower positions and are concealed inside the cabinet. More forgiving on positioning — pipes can be adjusted inside the cabinet during fit-off. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Supply:** DN15 hot and cold with quarter-turn isolation valves (mini stop cocks). Flexible braided hoses to mixer tap. **Waste:** DN40 PVC or chrome. P-trap or S-trap with 50mm water seal. For exposed (visible) installations: chrome bottle trap or chrome P-trap. **Basin mixer:** Single-hole or three-hole depending on the basin/tap configuration. Basin mixers typically have 150mm or 200mm spout reach. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every bathroom renovation includes at least one vanity basin. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 and 3500.2. Isolation valves mandatory (one hot, one cold per basin). AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 requires isolation valve immediately upstream of flexible hose connectors. Tempering valve or thermostatic mixer required on basin supply (see B8). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not confirming whether the vanity is wall-hung or floor-standing before rough-in — pipe exit positions are completely different. (2) For wall-hung vanities: pipe exits not aligning with the vanity's service hole positions — requires re-routing after the fact. (3) Not allowing adequate clearance below the basin for the trap (especially with shallow basins — the trap may not physically fit). (4) Using an S-trap for a wall-hung vanity — the trap would be visible hanging below the vanity, which is unacceptable. (5) For double basins: not running separate supply and waste for each basin. (6) Not replacing old isolation valves with new quarter-turn ball valves during the renovation. (7) Installing a bottle trap for a heavily-used basin (e.g., family bathroom) — bottle traps block more easily than standard P-traps. |

### B5. Toilet Rough-In

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The first-fix and second-fix plumbing for the toilet (WC), including the waste connection (soil pipe), water supply to the cistern, and the critical set-out distance. The toilet is the most regulated fixture in a bathroom — it connects to the soil (sewage) drainage system and must comply with specific standards for trap type, set-out, and venting. |
| **What it involves** | **Waste connection (soil pipe):** The toilet pan connects to a DN100 (100mm) soil pipe. The connection type depends on the pan's trap configuration: S-trap (floor outlet) or P-trap (wall outlet). The soil pipe connects to the building's sewer drainage system. A floor flange or pan connector provides the sealed connection between the pan's outlet and the soil pipe. **Water supply:** A DN15 cold water supply to the cistern, with an isolation valve (mini stop cock). The supply can enter the cistern from the bottom (bottom inlet — most common), from the side (side inlet), or from the back (back inlet), depending on the cistern type. The location of the supply point must match the cistern's inlet position. **Set-out distance:** This is the critical measurement — the distance from the finished wall surface to the centre of the waste outlet in the floor (for S-trap) or from the finished floor to the centre of the waste outlet in the wall (for P-trap). Getting the set-out wrong means the toilet pan will not fit. |
| **S-trap vs P-trap** | **S-trap (floor outlet):** The toilet pan's waste outlet points downward through the floor. The set-out distance is measured from the finished wall to the centre of the floor waste. Standard Australian set-out: **140mm** from the finished wall is the most common. Some pans offer adjustable set-out ranges (e.g., Caroma Profile II: 140-255mm using offset connectors). **P-trap (wall outlet):** The toilet pan's waste outlet points horizontally through the wall. The set-out distance is measured from the finished floor to the centre of the wall waste. Standard Australian P-trap set-out: **185mm** from finished floor. P-traps are more common in older Australian homes and in some regions. They simplify waste pipe routing (no slab penetration required) but limit pan selection. **Back-to-wall and wall-hung pans:** Modern back-to-wall pans can accommodate either S-trap or P-trap configurations. Wall-hung pans (suspended off the floor) always use a P-trap (wall outlet) and require a concealed cistern and structural support frame behind the wall (e.g., Geberit Duofix frame). |
| **Concealed cistern vs close-coupled** | **Close-coupled:** The cistern sits directly on top of the toilet pan. This is the traditional Australian toilet configuration. Simple to install — the cistern simply bolts to the pan. The plumber connects the cold water supply to the cistern inlet and the overflow to the waste system. **Concealed cistern (in-wall):** The cistern is mounted inside the wall cavity behind the toilet. Only the flush plate (button panel) is visible on the wall surface. Requires: a purpose-built frame (e.g., Geberit Sigma 8, Caroma Invisi Series II) that is fixed to the wall framing during rough-in; the cistern is plumbed during rough-in (water supply and overflow); the wall is then closed, waterproofed, and tiled over the cistern; and the flush plate is installed as the last step. Concealed cisterns create a cleaner, more modern look and are easier to clean around. They are more expensive and more complex to install, and repairs require accessing the cistern through the flush plate opening (most modern concealed cisterns are designed for front-access servicing). **Important compatibility note:** Caroma will only honour the warranty of their in-wall cisterns if paired with Caroma pans. Geberit cisterns are compatible with a wider range of pans. Always check manufacturer compatibility before ordering. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Soil pipe:** DN100 (100mm) PVC. Floor flange or pan collar connector. Offset pan connectors available for adjusting set-out (typically ±40mm adjustment range). **Water supply:** DN15 cold water with quarter-turn isolation valve. Flexible braided hose to cistern inlet. **Set-out — S-trap:** Standard 140mm from finished wall. Adjustable to 255mm with offset connectors (model-dependent). **Set-out — P-trap:** Standard 185mm from finished floor. **Concealed cistern frame:** Geberit Sigma 8 or Caroma Invisi Series II are the dominant brands in Australia. Frame dimensions approximately 500mm wide x 1120mm high x 120-200mm deep (model-dependent). Dual flush: 4.5/3 litre (4-star WELS) or 6/3 litre (3-star WELS). |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every bathroom renovation includes a toilet (unless it is a separate WC room not included in the bathroom scope). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary plumbing and drainage). DN100 soil pipe for toilet waste. Soil pipe must be vented per AS/NZS 3500.2. The toilet must have a WELS (Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards) rating — minimum 3-star for new installations (varies by jurisdiction). All fittings WaterMark certified. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Getting the set-out distance wrong — this is the most common toilet rough-in error. If the set-out is wrong by even 10-20mm, the toilet pan may not fit or may sit too far from or too close to the wall. Always measure from the FINISHED wall surface (including tiles), not the raw wall. (2) Not checking whether the pan requires an S-trap or P-trap before rough-in — the wrong trap type means the pan cannot connect to the waste pipe. (3) For concealed cisterns: not installing the frame during rough-in — it must be in place before the wall is closed and tiled. (4) Not checking compatibility between the cistern brand and the pan brand (especially Caroma's warranty requirement for Caroma-only pairings with Caroma cisterns). (5) Forgetting the overflow connection for the cistern — most cisterns have an overflow that must connect to the waste system. (6) Not providing adequate support for a wall-hung pan — the Geberit/Caroma frame must be properly secured to the floor and wall framing to support the weight of the pan and the user (typically rated to 400kg). (7) Not plugging the soil pipe during demolition — an open soil pipe allows sewer gas into the bathroom throughout the renovation. |

### B6. Heated Towel Rail Connection (Hydronic)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The plumbing connection for a hydronic heated towel rail. Hydronic towel rails operate by circulating hot water from a central hydronic heating system through the rail. The plumbing scope only applies to hydronic rails — electric heated towel rails are the electrician's scope (hardwired or plugged in). **Important:** The vast majority of heated towel rails installed in Australian bathroom renovations are **electric**, not hydronic. Hydronic rails are only applicable if the home has an existing hydronic heating system (boiler-based central heating). |
| **What it involves** | **If hydronic:** The plumber runs hot water supply and return pipework from the nearest hydronic heating circuit to the towel rail mounting position. The rail is connected to the heating circuit with isolation valves on both the supply and return lines. The circuit must be balanced (flow and return temperatures and pressures matched) to ensure the rail heats evenly. A thermostatic radiator valve (TRV) may be installed to allow individual temperature control. **If electric (for reference):** No plumbing is required. The electrician hardwires the rail to a dedicated circuit or installs a switched power point nearby. Electrical heated towel rails use a dry element or oil-filled element and operate at 40-60 degrees Celsius. |
| **Typical specifications — Hydronic** | **Pipework:** 15mm (DN15) copper or multilayer pipe for supply and return. **Connections:** Typically 1/2" BSP male or female threaded connections at the rail. Isolation valves (ball valves) on both supply and return. **Temperature:** The hydronic circuit typically operates at 50-70 degrees Celsius (set by the boiler). The towel rail heats to approximately 55 degrees Celsius. **Mounting:** The rail is wall-mounted with concealed pipework running through the wall cavity. Pipe positions must be set during rough-in to align with the rail's inlet and outlet connections. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — and only within the plumbing scope if the rail is hydronic. Most Australian bathroom renovations use electric heated towel rails, which are purely an electrical scope item. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.4 (heated water services — if connected to the heated water system). The hydronic heating system must comply with AS/NZS 3500.4 and the manufacturer's installation requirements. If the hydronic system is gas-fired, the boiler must comply with AS/NZS 5601.1. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Assuming a heated towel rail is a plumbing item when it is actually electric — always confirm the rail type before including in the plumbing scope. (2) For hydronic rails: not running supply and return pipework during rough-in — these pipes must be in the wall before waterproofing and tiling. (3) Not balancing the hydronic circuit after installing the rail — an unbalanced circuit causes uneven heating (the rail may be hot at the top and cold at the bottom, or vice versa). (4) Not installing isolation valves — without them, the entire hydronic heating circuit must be drained to service the towel rail. |

### B7. In-Floor Heating (Hydronic)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Hydronic in-floor heating uses hot water circulating through pipes embedded in the bathroom floor to provide radiant heat. The plumbing scope applies only to hydronic in-floor heating — electric in-floor heating (heating mats or cables embedded under tiles) is the electrician's scope. As with hydronic towel rails, hydronic in-floor heating is only applicable if the home has a hydronic heating system. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs a network of small-diameter PEX or PE-RT (polyethylene of raised temperature resistance) pipes in a serpentine or spiral pattern across the bathroom floor, typically at 150-200mm spacing. These pipes are connected to the hydronic heating circuit's manifold. The pipes are laid on top of insulation (polystyrene boards or foil-backed insulation) and covered by the screed/mortar bed before tiling. A manifold with flow control valves and a circulating pump is installed (often in a utility cupboard or the ceiling cavity above the bathroom) to control water temperature and flow rate. The floor must be designed to accommodate the additional build-up height of the insulation + pipe + screed (typically 40-60mm total). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pipe:** 12mm or 16mm OD PEX or PE-RT pipe. Spacing: 150-200mm. Must be pressure-tested before screed is poured. **Manifold:** Brass or stainless steel with individual circuit flow control. Typically installed in a manifold box in the adjacent wall or ceiling. **Operating temperature:** 35-45 degrees Celsius (lower than radiator circuits — floor heating uses lower temperatures for comfort). **Screed:** Self-levelling compound or sand/cement screed, typically 30-40mm above the top of the pipe. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — premium bathroom feature. Only within the plumbing scope if the system is hydronic. Electric in-floor heating is far more common in Australian bathroom renovations and is the electrician's scope. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.4. The heating system must be designed by the hydronic system supplier or a hydraulic engineer. Pressure testing mandatory before screed is poured. The system must include a mixing valve or thermostatic control to limit floor surface temperature (maximum 29 degrees Celsius at the floor surface per relevant standards to prevent discomfort/burns). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not accounting for the floor build-up height — hydronic in-floor heating adds 40-60mm to the floor height, which affects door clearances, step heights, and transitions to adjacent rooms. (2) Not pressure-testing the pipe network before pouring screed — a leak under the screed is catastrophic. (3) Not insulating below the pipes — without insulation, heat is lost into the slab below instead of radiating upward into the room. (4) Confusing hydronic (plumbing scope) with electric (electrical scope) in-floor heating. |

### B8. Tempering Valve (TMV) Installation / Relocation

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A tempering valve (also referred to as a thermostatic mixing valve or TMV in some contexts) is a device that blends hot and cold water to deliver water at a safe, controlled temperature to personal hygiene fixtures (basins, baths, showers, bidets). It is a **mandatory requirement** in Australian plumbing for all new and replacement hot water installations and for fixtures in bathrooms serving certain populations. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs the tempering valve on the hot water supply line, typically in the ceiling cavity, wall cavity, or under the floor — as close as practical to the fixtures it serves. The valve has three connections: hot water inlet (from the hot water system), cold water inlet (from the cold supply), and tempered water outlet (to the fixtures). The valve is set to limit the outlet temperature to the appropriate maximum. Strainers and isolation valves are installed on both inlets. The valve must be accessible for maintenance and testing (access panel required if concealed in a wall or ceiling). |
| **Temperature requirements** | **AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 and AS/NZS 4032.3** specify maximum delivery temperatures: **50 degrees Celsius** — maximum delivery temperature at personal hygiene fixtures in domestic (residential Class 1 and 2) buildings. **45 degrees Celsius** — maximum delivery temperature at fixtures used by children, the elderly, or people with disabilities (e.g., aged care, childcare centres, hospitals). **Note:** The hot water storage temperature must still be maintained at a minimum of 60 degrees Celsius to prevent Legionella bacteria growth (AS/NZS 3500.4). The tempering valve bridges this requirement — hot water is stored at 60+ degrees and tempered down to 50 degrees (or 45 degrees) at the point of delivery. |
| **Tempering valve vs thermostatic mixing valve** | **Tempering valve (AS/NZS 4032.3):** Used in standard domestic installations. Limits outlet temperature to a maximum preset value (typically 50 degrees Celsius). Non-serviceable — must be replaced at intervals not exceeding five years (per AS/NZS 4032.3). Lower cost. **Thermostatic mixing valve / TMV (AS/NZS 4032.1):** Used in healthcare, aged care, and childcare facilities. Provides more precise temperature control (typically 38-45 degrees Celsius). Serviceable — can be maintained and rebuilt. Includes fail-safe mechanisms (shuts off if the cold supply fails, preventing scalding). Higher cost. Must be tested annually by a qualified technician. **For standard residential bathroom renovations, a tempering valve (AS/NZS 4032.3) is the standard requirement.** |
| **Typical specifications** | **Valve size:** 15mm or 20mm (DN15/DN20) depending on the number of fixtures served. A single 20mm tempering valve can serve all bathroom fixtures (shower, basin, bath). **Connections:** Compression or BSP threaded. Hot and cold inlets with strainers and isolation valves. Tempered outlet. **Brands:** Reliance Heatguard, AVG, RMC Thermostatic — commonly available through Reece, Tradelink, and Samios (major Australian plumbing suppliers). **Replacement interval:** Five years maximum per AS/NZS 4032.3 (for tempering valves). |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD / MANDATORY** — a tempering valve is required for all new and replacement hot water installations and for any bathroom renovation where hot water supply to fixtures is being modified. It is a compliance requirement, not optional. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 (heated water services). AS/NZS 4032.3 (tempering valves). The tempering valve must be: WaterMark certified; installed in an accessible location; set to deliver water at no more than 50 degrees Celsius (residential) or 45 degrees Celsius (vulnerable populations); replaced at five-year intervals; and listed on the Compliance Certificate as a regulated item. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing a tempering valve at all — this is a compliance failure and a scalding hazard. (2) Installing the tempering valve in an inaccessible location (e.g., inside a sealed wall cavity with no access panel) — it must be accessible for replacement every five years. (3) Not installing strainers on the inlet — debris in the water supply can damage the valve's internal mechanism, causing temperature control failure. (4) Setting the valve to the wrong temperature — must be 50 degrees maximum for residential (45 degrees for vulnerable populations). (5) Not including the tempering valve on the Compliance Certificate — it is a regulated plumbing item. (6) Not testing the tempered water temperature at the fixture after installation — the temperature must be verified with a thermometer at each fixture. (7) Confusing the tempering valve with the hot water system's thermostat — they are separate devices. The HWS thermostat controls storage temperature (60+ degrees). The tempering valve controls delivery temperature (50 degrees max). |

### B9. Floor Waste Positioning (Wet Area Requirements)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The floor waste (floor drain) in a bathroom is a drain point in the bathroom floor that allows water to drain in the event of fixture overflow, pipe burst, or general water spillage. The requirements for floor wastes in bathrooms are governed by AS 3740:2021 (Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas) and the NCC (National Construction Code). |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs a floor waste grate connected to a trapped waste pipe that discharges to the drainage system. The floor must be graded (sloped) toward the floor waste to ensure water drains effectively. The puddle flange at the floor waste creates a waterproof seal with the bathroom floor membrane. |
| **Code requirements** | **Shower area:** A floor waste is **mandatory** in every shower area per AS 3740:2021. This is the shower drain itself (covered in B2 above). **General bathroom floor (outside shower):** The NCC Volume 2 (Housing Provisions) Part 10.2 does NOT mandate a floor waste outside the shower area in a Class 1 building (house). The floor area outside the shower may rely on a waterproof floor and floor/wall junctions alone. However, a floor waste in the general bathroom floor is strongly recommended as best practice for safety (overflow protection). Many plumbers and building certifiers will insist on one. **Unenclosed shower (no screen or screen < 900mm):** If the shower does not have a shower screen of at least 900mm in length, the shower is considered "unenclosed" and an additional floor waste may be required in the broader bathroom floor area to capture spray and overflow. **State variations:** Some states or local councils have additional requirements. For example, QLD generally requires a floor waste in every bathroom, not just the shower. Always check local requirements. |
| **Position guidelines** | The floor waste should be positioned: in the lowest point of the bathroom floor (the floor must fall toward it from all directions); at least 150mm from any wall (so the grate is not partially covered by skirting or wall finishes); not directly behind the toilet pan or under the vanity (where it would be inaccessible); in an accessible location where it can be cleaned and maintained; and where it does not create a trip hazard or an aesthetically poor outcome. Typical positions: near the shower entry (so it catches overspray), in the centre of the bathroom floor, or near the doorway. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Floor waste grate:** 80mm (DN80) or 100mm (DN100) PVC or stainless steel body. Square grate 100mm x 100mm or round grate 80-100mm diameter. Puddle flange for waterproof membrane seal. Trapped waste (must maintain water seal to prevent sewer gas entry). **Floor fall:** Minimum 1:80 to the floor waste across the bathroom floor. Maximum 1:50. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD in the shower area** (mandatory). **RECOMMENDED but not always mandatory** in the general bathroom floor area for Class 1 buildings (houses). **Check local requirements** — varies by state and council. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021. NCC Volume 2, Part 10.2. AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary plumbing). Floor waste grate must be WaterMark certified. Puddle flange must be compatible with the waterproofing system. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not including a floor waste outside the shower area — while not always mandatory, it is strongly recommended and many certifiers require it. (2) Positioning the floor waste in an inaccessible location (e.g., behind the toilet or under a cabinet). (3) Not achieving adequate floor fall to the waste — water pools on the bathroom floor instead of draining. (4) Using a floor waste grate that is not compatible with the waterproofing membrane system — the puddle flange connection is critical. (5) In hobless (stepless) shower designs, not ensuring the entire bathroom floor falls toward the shower waste — in a hobless shower, the shower waste often serves as the only bathroom floor waste. |

### B10. Bidet or Bidet Seat Provisions

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Plumbing provisions for a standalone bidet fixture or a bidet toilet seat (a seat that replaces the standard toilet seat and adds bidet functionality). Bidets are increasingly popular in Australian renovations, with bidet toilet seats being far more common than standalone bidet fixtures. |
| **What it involves** | **Bidet toilet seat (most common):** A T-valve (tee connector) is installed on the toilet's cold water supply line, branching off a dedicated supply for the bidet seat. A small-diameter braided hose connects from the T-valve to the bidet seat's water inlet. An isolation valve (ball valve) is installed for the bidet supply. Some bidet seats also require a warm water supply — this can be provided by: (a) a T-valve on the nearby basin hot water supply; (b) a self-heating model (requires only cold water supply but needs an electrical connection); or (c) a dedicated hot water line run from the nearest hot water branch. Most modern bidet seats (e.g., Roca, TOTO Washlet, Axent) are self-heating electric models that require cold water only plus a nearby power point (GPO). **Standalone bidet fixture:** A separate fixture (similar in size to a toilet) with its own hot and cold water supply, mixer tap, and waste connection. Requires: DN15 hot and cold supply with isolation valves; DN40 waste with trap; dedicated floor space adjacent to the toilet. Standalone bidets are rare in Australian residential renovations due to space constraints. |
| **Backflow prevention — Critical compliance requirement** | **Bidets are classified as a HIGH HAZARD cross-connection risk** in Australian plumbing (AS/NZS 3500.1). This is because the bidet spray nozzle is below the flood level of the fixture, creating a potential backflow path from waste water to the potable water supply. **Required protection:** A high-hazard backflow prevention device (RPZ — Reduced Pressure Zone device) must be installed on the bidet's water supply. This RPZ device must be tested annually by a backflow-accredited plumber and a test report submitted to the local water authority. This is a significant ongoing compliance and cost obligation. **Alternative for bidet seats:** Some bidet toilet seat manufacturers claim their products include internal backflow prevention. However, Australian plumbing regulations generally still require an RPZ device. Check with the installing plumber and local water authority. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Bidet seat — cold water supply:** 15mm T-valve on the toilet cold supply. 10mm or 1/4" braided hose to bidet seat inlet. Quarter-turn isolation valve. **Bidet seat — electrical:** 240V GPO within 1-2 metres of the toilet (electrician scope). Must comply with bathroom electrical zone requirements (AS/NZS 3000). **Standalone bidet:** DN15 hot and cold supply. DN40 waste with P-trap or S-trap. Pop-up waste fitting. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — but provisions (a capped T-valve on the toilet supply and a nearby GPO) should be discussed with the homeowner during the renovation, as retrofitting a bidet seat later is more disruptive than provisioning during the renovation. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services — backflow prevention). High-hazard RPZ device mandatory. Annual testing of RPZ device by accredited plumber. WaterMark certification for all fittings. AS/NZS 3000 for electrical connections (electrician scope). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing an RPZ backflow prevention device — this is a compliance failure and a health hazard. (2) Assuming a bidet toilet seat is a simple DIY installation — in Australia, it requires a licensed plumber for the water connection and a licensed electrician for the power point, plus an RPZ device. (3) Not provisioning a power point near the toilet during the renovation — most electric bidet seats require a GPO within 1-2 metres. Retrofitting a power point in a tiled, waterproofed bathroom is very expensive. (4) Not checking local water authority requirements for bidet installations — some authorities have specific registration or notification requirements. (5) Forgetting the annual RPZ testing obligation — this is an ongoing cost and compliance requirement for the life of the bidet. |

### B11. Water Supply Isolation Valves (Per Fixture)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Individual isolation valves (also called service valves, stop cocks, or mini isolating valves) installed on the hot and cold water supply lines to each bathroom fixture (basin, shower, bath, toilet, bidet). These valves allow the water supply to a single fixture to be shut off for maintenance or emergency without affecting other fixtures in the bathroom or the house. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs a quarter-turn ball valve on each supply pipe at each fixture. For accessible fixtures (basin, toilet), the valves are typically installed inside the cabinet or visible below the fixture. For concealed fixtures (shower, bath), the valves are typically installed in the wall cavity behind an access panel, or in the ceiling cavity above. |
| **2025 update — Mandatory upstream of flexible hoses** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 now mandates that an isolation valve must be installed **immediately upstream of every flexible hose connector**. This means every braided hose connecting to a tap or fixture must have its own accessible isolation valve. This is a direct response to the epidemic of insurance claims from flexible hose failures in Australian homes (flexible hoses are the number one cause of non-weather-related water damage claims in Australia). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Valve type:** Quarter-turn ball valve (lever or knob handle). **Size:** DN15 (15mm) to match standard supply pipes. **Material:** Chrome-plated brass body. **Connections:** Compression x compression, or compression x BSP threaded. **Brands:** AVG, BWT, Crane, and Brass Ware (commonly available through Reece, Tradelink, Samios). |
| **Per-fixture requirements** | **Basin:** One hot, one cold (2 valves total per basin). **Shower:** One hot, one cold (2 valves — often in ceiling cavity or wall cavity behind access panel). **Bath:** One hot, one cold (2 valves — may be behind the bath access panel or in the wall cavity). **Toilet:** One cold (1 valve — typically visible at the base of the toilet, connecting the flexible hose to the cistern). **Bidet:** One cold (minimum), plus one hot if hot water is supplied (1-2 valves). **Typical bathroom total:** 7-10 isolation valves for a standard bathroom with basin, shower, bath, and toilet. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD / MANDATORY** — isolation valves at each fixture are a code requirement per AS/NZS 3500.1. The 2025 update makes isolation valves immediately upstream of flexible hoses explicitly mandatory. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025. All valves must be WaterMark certified. Valves must be accessible for operation and maintenance. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing isolation valves at all (still surprisingly common in budget renovations — this is a code violation). (2) Installing old-style gate valves instead of modern quarter-turn ball valves — gate valves seize over time and become inoperable. (3) Installing valves in inaccessible locations (e.g., behind tiled walls with no access panel) — they must be accessible. (4) Not providing an access panel for shower and bath isolation valves — these are concealed in the wall cavity and must be reachable. (5) Not replacing existing old valves during the renovation — if the renovation involves modifying the plumbing, all isolation valves on modified circuits should be replaced with new quarter-turn ball valves. |

### B12. Ventilation/Vent Stack Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Vent pipes (also called vent stacks or plumbing vents) are a critical component of the sanitary drainage system. They allow air into the drainage system to maintain atmospheric pressure, which prevents trap siphonage (the loss of water seal in traps that would allow sewer gas to enter the building). Every fixture's waste trap must be adequately vented. |
| **What it involves** | **Existing vent stack:** If the bathroom renovation maintains fixtures in approximately the same locations, the existing vent stack (which typically runs through the wall cavity and exits through the roof) should be adequate. The plumber verifies that each fixture's waste pipe is within the maximum unvented distance of the vent stack. **Adding new fixtures or relocating fixtures:** If fixtures are being added (e.g., a second basin) or relocated significantly, the plumber must verify that the new waste pipe runs can be adequately vented. If the distance from the fixture trap to the existing vent stack exceeds the maximum allowed (varies by pipe diameter — approximately 1.5m for DN40, 3.0m for DN50, per AS/NZS 3500.2), additional venting must be provided. This can be: (a) a new branch vent pipe connecting the fixture waste to the existing vent stack; (b) an Air Admittance Valve (AAV) — see A2 above for AAV details; or (c) in rare cases, a new vent stack through the roof. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Vent pipe:** DN40 (40mm) or DN50 (50mm) PVC. Must rise to a minimum height above the roofline (typically 150mm above the roof penetration, with a vent cowl). **AAV:** DN40 or DN50, installed above the flood level of the highest fixture on the circuit. Must be accessible. WaterMark certified. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD / MANDATORY** — all sanitary fixtures must be vented per AS/NZS 3500.2. The question is whether the existing venting is adequate or whether additional venting is required due to the renovation. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.2:2025. Every trap must be vented. AAVs are permitted where conventional venting is impractical, subject to local authority acceptance. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not verifying that relocated fixtures are within the maximum unvented distance of the vent stack — results in gurgling drains, slow drainage, and trap siphonage. (2) Not providing additional venting when adding fixtures — the existing vent stack may not have capacity for additional fixtures. (3) Installing an AAV below the flood level of the fixture — it must be above. (4) Not checking the existing vent stack condition during the renovation — old vent stacks may be cracked, blocked, or disconnected in the roof cavity. |

### B13. Waterproofing Coordination — What Plumbing Must Be Done BEFORE Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The critical coordination between the plumber and the waterproofer during a bathroom renovation. Certain plumbing tasks MUST be completed before waterproofing begins, and certain plumbing tasks must occur during or after waterproofing. Getting this sequencing wrong is one of the most expensive mistakes in bathroom renovations — it can require complete removal and re-application of the waterproof membrane ($2,000-$5,000+). |
| **Plumbing tasks that MUST be completed BEFORE waterproofing** | (1) **All in-wall pipework** — hot and cold supply pipes, shower mixer body, bath mixer body, all pipe clips and bracketry. These must be fully installed and pressure-tested. (2) **All in-floor pipework** — waste pipes, soil pipes, under-slab connections. (3) **Shower waste body** — installed at the correct height in the floor. (4) **Floor waste body** — installed at the correct height. (5) **Toilet soil pipe** — installed at the correct position and height with floor flange. (6) **All slab/floor penetrations** — completed, sealed, and ready for waterproofing around them. (7) **Pressure testing** — all supply pipework must be pressure-tested and verified leak-free before the membrane is applied. If a leak is discovered after waterproofing, the membrane must be removed, the leak repaired, and the membrane re-applied. (8) **Pipe clipping and securing** — all pipes must be firmly secured to prevent movement that could damage the membrane. |
| **Plumbing tasks during/after waterproofing** | (1) **Puddle flanges** — the puddle flanges on shower wastes and floor wastes are installed and clamped to the waterproof membrane. The waterproofer bonds the membrane to the flange. This is a shared responsibility between the plumber and waterproofer and must be coordinated on-site. (2) **Hob/threshold sealing** — if a shower hob is present, the waterproofer seals the membrane over the hob. The plumber ensures the waste is correctly positioned relative to the hob. |
| **Plumbing tasks AFTER waterproofing and tiling (second fix)** | (1) Shower mixer faceplate, handle, and diverter. (2) Shower arm and rose. (3) Bath spout and mixer faceplate. (4) Basin mixer tap. (5) Vanity waste trap and connections. (6) Toilet pan and cistern. (7) Floor waste grate (sits on the tiled surface). (8) Shower waste grate (sits on the tiled surface). (9) Heated towel rail (if hydronic — final connections). (10) Flexible hose connections and commissioning. (11) Tempering valve commissioning and temperature verification. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD / MANDATORY** — this coordination is essential for every wet-area renovation. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 (waterproofing). AS/NZS 3500.1 and 3500.2 (plumbing). The waterproofing must be inspected and certified before tiling commences. The plumber's rough-in must be complete and pressure-tested before waterproofing. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) The plumber and waterproofer not communicating — they must coordinate on puddle flange installation, pipe penetration sealing, and timing. (2) The plumber returning after waterproofing to drill or cut into the membrane for a forgotten pipe — this breaches the waterproof membrane and requires patching or complete re-waterproofing. (3) Not pressure-testing plumbing before waterproofing — a leak behind the membrane is invisible and will cause damage over months or years before being detected. (4) The plumber moving pipes after the waterproofer has bonded the membrane — any pipe movement can tear the membrane at penetrations. (5) Not leaving adequate access for second-fix plumbing — the waterproofer and tiler must leave mixer body recesses and waste outlets accessible for the plumber's return. |

## C. Laundry Renovation

The laundry is a wet area under Australian building regulations. It requires waterproofing (per AS 3740:2021) and shares many of the same plumbing requirements as a bathroom, though with fewer fixtures and lower complexity. A typical Australian laundry renovation includes provisions for a washing machine, a dryer, a laundry tub or sink, and often a floor waste. The laundry may also be a wet area within or adjacent to a bathroom (common in apartments — combined bathroom/laundry layouts).

**Key regulatory note:** Where laundry facilities are provided within a bathroom or kitchen area (common in compact apartments), the waterproofing and plumbing requirements for a laundry still apply in addition to those for the primary room type. If a laundry tub does not have an overflow, a floor waste is generally required to catch overflow water.

### C1. Washing Machine Taps (Hot and Cold Supply)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The water supply taps for a washing machine. In Australian laundries, dedicated washing machine taps are installed on the wall at an elevated height, providing hot and cold water via hose connections to the washing machine. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs two dedicated taps (one hot, one cold) on the wall behind or above the washing machine position. These taps have hose connections (typically 3/4" BSP or quick-connect) that connect to the washing machine's inlet hoses. The taps must include integral isolation (the tap handles serve as isolation valves — turning them off shuts off the water supply to the machine). In modern installations, dedicated washing machine outlet boxes (e.g., Allproof MiniMax washing machine box) are increasingly popular — these are recessed wall boxes that contain the hot and cold taps, the waste outlet, and sometimes the power point in a single neat unit, reducing the visual clutter of exposed taps and hoses. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Tap type:** Washing machine stop cock / hose cock. Quarter-turn ceramic disc taps are standard (replacing old rising-spindle taps). 1/2" BSP inlet (from the wall supply pipe) x 3/4" BSP outlet (for the washing machine hose). Chrome-plated brass body. **Height:** Taps are typically installed at **1000-1100mm AFL** (above finished floor level). This height allows easy access to turn taps on and off and keeps the hoses above the flood level of the machine. For front-loading machines, taps can be lower (800-900mm AFL) as the machine is shorter. For machines installed on a plinth/pedestal, adjust height accordingly. **Supply pipes:** DN15 (15mm) copper, PEX, or multilayer for both hot and cold branches. **Hose connections:** The washing machine's inlet hoses (typically supplied with the machine) connect to the taps via 3/4" BSP threaded fittings. Rubber washers in the hose couplings provide the seal. |
| **Hot water supply note** | Most modern washing machines in Australia are **cold fill only** — they heat their own water internally. However, Australian laundry plumbing traditionally provides both hot and cold taps. Even if the current machine is cold fill only, it is best practice to install both taps (provisions for future machines that may require hot water, and for general-purpose hot water use in the laundry). Some homeowners connect the hot tap to a warm water mixer or simply leave it capped. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required in every laundry renovation. Both hot and cold taps should be provided even if the current washing machine is cold fill only. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services). Isolation (quarter-turn taps) at the machine connection. Flexible hoses from tap to machine must comply with AS 3499:2022. WaterMark certification for all fittings. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Installing taps too low — they should be above the flood level of the washing machine to prevent backflow. (2) Not turning off the taps when the machine is not in use — washing machine hoses are under constant pressure when the taps are open, increasing the risk of hose burst and catastrophic water damage. (3) Using cheap or old washing machine hoses — these are a major source of water damage claims. Stainless steel braided hoses with auto-shutoff (burst-protection) are recommended. (4) Not providing hot water supply — even if the current machine is cold fill, provision both taps for future flexibility. (5) Not considering a washing machine outlet box — these provide a much neater, more protected installation than exposed taps. (6) Installing taps behind the washing machine where they are difficult to reach — particularly important for front-loaders that sit close to the wall. |

### C2. Washing Machine Waste Connection

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The drainage connection for the washing machine's discharge water. The machine pumps grey water out through a flexible discharge hose, which must connect to the laundry's drainage system in a code-compliant manner. |
| **What it involves** | The washing machine's discharge hose must connect to the drainage system through one of two approved methods: **Standpipe method (most common in Australian renovations):** A vertical standpipe (typically DN40, 40mm PVC) is mounted on the wall behind the machine. The standpipe is trapped at the base (P-trap or S-trap connecting to the waste pipe). The washing machine's discharge hose hooks over the top of the standpipe, allowing water to flow down the standpipe and through the trap to the drain. The top of the standpipe must be above the flood level of the washing machine to prevent backflow. Standard standpipe height: 600-900mm AFL. **Floor waste method (less common for dedicated connection):** In some installations, particularly older homes, the washing machine discharge hose drains into a nearby floor waste grate. This is acceptable if the floor waste is trapped and vented, and the discharge does not cause flooding. However, the standpipe method is preferred as it provides a more controlled and neater connection. **Washing machine outlet box method (modern):** As mentioned in C1, modern outlet boxes (e.g., Allproof MiniMax) include an integrated waste outlet (DN40 trap and connection) in the same recessed wall box as the taps. The discharge hose connects directly to the outlet box. |
| **Trap and AAV** | The standpipe must be trapped at its base to maintain a water seal and prevent sewer gas entry. A P-trap (discharging through the wall to the waste pipe) is the most common configuration. An Air Admittance Valve (AAV) may be installed on the standpipe above the flood level to provide venting, particularly if the standpipe is far from the vent stack. The AAV prevents negative pressure from siphoning the trap water seal during the machine's high-volume discharge cycle. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Standpipe:** DN40 (40mm) PVC. Height: 600-900mm AFL (top of standpipe above machine flood level). **Trap:** DN40 P-trap or S-trap. Minimum 50mm water seal. **Waste pipe from trap to drain:** DN40 or DN50. Minimum fall 1:40 for DN40, 1:40 for DN50. **AAV (if required):** DN40, installed above the flood level of the standpipe. WaterMark certified. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every laundry renovation requires a washing machine waste connection. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary plumbing and drainage). Trapped connection mandatory. Standpipe top above the flood level of the fixture. Adequate venting required. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not providing a trapped waste connection — the discharge hose must not simply drain into an open floor waste without a trap. (2) Using a standpipe that is too short — the top must be above the machine's flood level to prevent backflow during high-water-level wash cycles. (3) Not venting the standpipe — washing machine discharge is high-volume and can create enough negative pressure to siphon the trap water seal, allowing sewer gas to enter. An AAV on the standpipe is good practice. (4) Using an undersized waste pipe — DN40 minimum for the standpipe and trap. (5) The discharge hose falling out of the standpipe during the machine's pump cycle — the hose must be secured (hooked or clipped) in the standpipe to prevent it from being pushed out by water pressure. (6) Not considering the washing machine's pump capacity — front-loading machines pump at a higher rate than top-loaders, and the waste system must handle the peak flow rate without overflowing the standpipe. |

### C3. Laundry Tub/Sink Rough-In

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The plumbing rough-in and fit-off for a laundry tub (laundry sink). Laundry tubs are a standard fixture in Australian laundries, used for hand-washing clothes, soaking, cleaning, and general utility purposes. Modern laundry tubs range from compact single-bowl units (for small laundries) to large double-bowl stainless steel or composite tubs. |
| **What it involves** | Essentially the same as a kitchen sink rough-in (see A1-A3): hot and cold water supply pipes (DN15) with isolation valves; waste connection (DN40 — the laundry tub waste standard in Australia is DN40, not DN50 as for kitchen sinks, though DN50 is used for the main laundry waste line); P-trap or S-trap; and connection to the laundry waste pipe and drain. The laundry tub typically includes a standard laundry mixer tap (single lever or dual handles). Some laundry tub models include a built-in bypass for the washing machine waste (a spigot on the tub's waste outlet to which the washing machine discharge hose can connect). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Water supply:** DN15 hot and cold with isolation valves. Flexible braided hoses to mixer tap. **Waste:** DN40 (40mm) trap (P-trap or S-trap). Waste pipe from trap to main laundry drain: DN40 or DN50. **Tub types:** Stainless steel (most common), composite (Quartz or engineered stone), ceramic. Sizes from 450mm (compact single) to 900mm+ (double bowl). **Overflow:** Most laundry tubs include an overflow connection — if the tub does NOT have an overflow, AS 3740:2021 and state regulations may require a floor waste in the laundry to provide emergency drainage. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — laundry tubs are required in standalone Australian laundries per NCC requirements (Class 1 buildings must have laundry facilities including a washtub). In combined bathroom/laundry or European-laundry configurations (where the machine is in a cupboard), a tub may not always be included, but building regulations generally require one. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 (water services). AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary drainage). NCC housing provisions require laundry facilities including a washtub. If the tub has no overflow, a floor waste is generally required. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not including a laundry tub when it is required by the NCC — check whether the building classification requires a washtub. (2) Not checking whether the tub has an overflow — if it does not, a floor waste must be provided. (3) Undersizing the waste pipe — the laundry tub waste and the washing machine waste often share a common drain, and the combined flow must be accommodated. (4) Not coordinating the tub position with the overall laundry layout — the tub, washing machine, and dryer all compete for limited wall space, and the plumbing must suit the final layout. |

---

### C4. Dryer Provisions (Condensate Drain)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Plumbing provisions for clothes dryers, specifically for condensate drainage from heat pump dryers or condenser dryers. Traditional vented dryers do not require any plumbing connection (they vent moist air through a flexible duct to the exterior). However, modern condenser and heat pump dryers produce condensate water that must be drained. |
| **What it involves** | **Vented dryers:** No plumbing required. The dryer vents to the exterior through a flexible duct (not a plumbing scope item). **Condenser / heat pump dryers:** These dryers extract moisture from the clothes and condense it into water. The condensate can be collected in a removable tray (which the user must empty manually) or drained via a small-diameter hose to a nearby drain point. If a permanent drain connection is desired, the plumber runs a small-diameter hose (typically 10-15mm) from the dryer's condensate outlet to the nearest waste connection (laundry tub waste, standpipe, or floor waste). No pump is required — the condensate hose relies on gravity. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Condensate hose:** 10-15mm ID flexible hose (supplied with some dryer models or purchased separately). **Drain connection:** The hose hooks into the washing machine standpipe, connects to a tee on the laundry tub waste, or drains into the floor waste. No trap is required on the condensate hose itself (the receiving drain is already trapped). **Flow rate:** Very low — typically 1-3 litres per drying cycle. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — only required if the homeowner is installing a condenser or heat pump dryer with a permanent drain connection. Not required for vented dryers. |
| **Compliance requirements** | No specific standard for dryer condensate drainage. The connection to the drainage system must comply with AS/NZS 3500.2 general provisions (indirect waste discharge). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not provisioning a condensate drain point near the dryer during the renovation — if the homeowner later purchases a heat pump dryer, there is no convenient drain connection. Providing a capped 15mm connection near the dryer position during the renovation is low-cost insurance. (2) Routing the condensate hose with inadequate fall — the hose relies on gravity and must slope continuously downward from the dryer to the drain. (3) Connecting the condensate hose directly into a sealed waste pipe without an air gap — this can cause siphonage. An indirect connection (hose draining into a standpipe or over a floor waste grate) is preferred. |

### C5. Additional Taps (Garden Tap, Mop Sink)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Additional tap outlets in or near the laundry, including garden taps (hose cocks) accessible from the laundry or exterior, and mop sink/cleaner's sink provisions. In Australian renovations, the laundry is often the starting point for external garden taps and utility water points. |
| **What it involves** | **Garden tap relocation or addition:** Running a cold water supply pipe (DN15 or DN20) from the laundry supply through the external wall to a hose cock (garden tap) on the exterior of the house. The garden tap is typically a 3/4" BSP hose cock (brass or chrome) with a back-flow prevention device. If the home uses a rainwater tank for garden irrigation, the garden tap may be connected to the rainwater supply rather than the mains (see D6 below). **Mop sink / cleaner's sink:** A low-level or floor-mounted sink with hot and cold water supply and a trapped waste, used for filling mop buckets and cleaning. These are more common in commercial settings but may be requested in large homes or homes with extensive hard flooring. |
| **Backflow prevention for garden taps** | A garden hose connected to mains water is a **medium-to-high hazard cross-connection** (the hose end can be submerged in a pool, a chemical container, or lying on the ground — creating a backflow risk). AS/NZS 3500.1 requires backflow prevention on all hose connection points. Options include: a hose-connection vacuum breaker (HVB) fitted directly to the tap outlet; a dual-check valve on the supply line; or a reduced pressure zone (RPZ) device for high-hazard situations. Most residential garden taps use a hose-connection vacuum breaker as the minimum protection. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — garden tap relocation/addition is a common request during laundry renovations but is not mandatory. Mop sinks are rare in residential settings. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1. Backflow prevention required on all hose connection points. Garden taps must be frost-protected in areas prone to freezing (parts of VIC, TAS, ACT, and highland NSW). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not including backflow prevention on garden taps — a compliance requirement often overlooked. (2) Not considering the garden tap position in relation to the new laundry layout — the tap may need to be relocated if the laundry layout changes. (3) Not running an adequate pipe size to the garden tap — DN15 provides good flow for a single garden hose, but DN20 is better for long runs or high-flow applications. |

---

### C6. Laundry Floor Waste

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A floor waste (floor drain) in the laundry floor to provide emergency drainage in the event of washing machine overflow, pipe burst, or tub overflow. The requirements for a laundry floor waste depend on the state and the specific laundry configuration. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs a floor waste grate with a puddle flange (similar to a bathroom floor waste — see B9). The laundry floor is graded (sloped) toward the floor waste. The floor waste connects to a trapped waste pipe discharging to the drainage system. |
| **Code requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires waterproofing in laundries where a floor waste is installed. The NCC and state-specific regulations determine when a floor waste is required: **General rule:** If the laundry includes fixtures without overflow protection (e.g., a washing machine — which can overflow — or a laundry tub without an overflow), a floor waste is generally required. **If all fixtures have overflow:** A floor waste may not be strictly mandatory, but is strongly recommended. **QLD:** Generally requires floor wastes in laundries. **VIC/NSW:** Check local council requirements — varies. **Waterproofing implication:** If a floor waste is installed, the laundry floor and floor/wall junctions MUST be waterproofed per AS 3740:2021. This adds significant cost to the renovation. Conversely, if no floor waste is provided and all fixtures have overflow protection, waterproofing of the laundry floor may not be strictly required (though it is still best practice). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Floor waste grate:** 80mm or 100mm (DN80/DN100) PVC body. Puddle flange. Trapped waste. **Floor fall:** Minimum 1:80 to the floor waste. **Waterproofing:** If a floor waste is installed, the laundry floor must be waterproofed per AS 3740:2021 — membrane applied to the floor and turned up the walls a minimum of 150mm (or higher if a shower or bath is present in a combined bathroom/laundry). |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD in most laundry configurations** — particularly where a washing machine is present. Check state and local requirements. The decision to include or exclude a floor waste has significant cost implications due to the waterproofing requirement. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 (waterproofing — triggered by the presence of a floor waste). AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary drainage). NCC housing provisions. State and local council regulations. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Including a floor waste without realising it triggers the waterproofing requirement — this can add $1,500-$3,000 to the renovation cost. (2) Not including a floor waste when it is required by local regulations. (3) Positioning the floor waste where it is inaccessible (e.g., under the washing machine). (4) Not achieving adequate floor fall — water pools in the laundry instead of draining. |

---

## D. Outdoor / Alfresco

Outdoor plumbing for Australian residential renovations covers outdoor kitchens (alfresco areas), gas BBQ connections, garden taps, outdoor showers, and rainwater tank connections. Outdoor plumbing must contend with UV exposure (affecting pipe material selection), frost (in some regions), and drainage to the stormwater system (not the sewer).

**Key principle:** Outdoor plumbing waste is classified differently from indoor waste. Kitchen waste (food waste, grease) is classed as sanitary waste and must connect to the sewer. General outdoor wash-down water may be permitted to discharge to the stormwater system in some jurisdictions, but grey water from sinks and showers must generally connect to the sewer. Always check local water authority and council requirements.

---

### D1. Outdoor Kitchen Sink Rough-In

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The plumbing rough-in for a sink in an outdoor kitchen or alfresco entertaining area. This includes hot and cold water supply and waste drainage, similar to an indoor kitchen sink but with additional considerations for outdoor exposure, pipe material selection, and drainage classification. |
| **What it involves** | Running hot and cold water supply pipes from the nearest internal supply point (typically the laundry or kitchen) through the external wall to the outdoor sink position. Installing isolation valves at the outdoor sink. Running a waste pipe from the outdoor sink to the sewer drainage system (not stormwater — sink waste contains food and grease). Installing a trap on the outdoor sink waste. Outdoor sinks may require a grease trap if the local council requires it (unusual for residential but possible in some areas). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Water supply:** DN15 copper (preferred for outdoor/UV-exposed runs) or PEX (must be protected from UV — run through conduit or wall cavity). Isolation valves at the sink. **Waste:** DN50 PVC waste pipe with P-trap or S-trap. Connected to the sewer (not stormwater). Minimum fall 1:40. **Outdoor-specific:** Pipes exposed to the weather must be UV-resistant (copper is naturally UV-resistant; PEX and multilayer must be shielded from direct sunlight). In frost-prone areas, outdoor pipes should be lagged (insulated) and fitted with a drip valve or be drainable. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the outdoor renovation includes a sink. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 and 3500.2. Outdoor sink waste must connect to the sewer (not stormwater). Pipe materials must be suitable for outdoor exposure. Local council may require a grease trap for outdoor kitchen waste. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Connecting outdoor sink waste to the stormwater system — this is a compliance violation; sink waste must go to the sewer. (2) Using PEX pipe for exposed outdoor runs without UV protection — PEX degrades rapidly in sunlight. (3) Not insulating outdoor pipes in frost-prone areas — frozen pipes can burst. (4) Not providing adequate hot water to the outdoor sink — the hot water run from the indoor system may be very long, resulting in significant wait times for hot water. Consider an instantaneous (point-of-use) hot water unit near the outdoor sink. (5) Not providing isolation valves that allow the outdoor plumbing to be shut off and drained during winter (in frost-prone areas). |

---

### D2. Gas BBQ Bayonet Connection

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A gas bayonet fitting (quick-connect coupling) installed outdoors for connecting a gas BBQ. This allows a natural gas BBQ to be connected to the home's gas supply via a flexible gas hose, eliminating the need for LPG bottles. |
| **What it involves** | The licensed gasfitter runs a gas supply pipe from the gas meter or an internal gas distribution point through the external wall to the outdoor BBQ position. A bayonet fitting is installed on the external wall or on a nearby post/pillar. An isolation valve (gas cock) is installed on the supply pipe, accessible near the bayonet. The BBQ connects to the bayonet via a certified flexible gas hose (natural gas rated). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pipe sizing:** DN15 (15mm) or DN20 (20mm) copper, depending on the BBQ's MJ/hr rating and the pipe run length. Calculation per AS/NZS 5601.1. **Bayonet fitting:** Compliant with AS/NZS 5601.1. Typically a Bromic or Rinnai bayonet fitting (common Australian brands). The bayonet includes a self-sealing mechanism that shuts off gas flow when the BBQ hose is disconnected. **Isolation valve:** Quarter-turn gas cock on the supply line, accessible near the bayonet. **Location requirements:** The bayonet must be at least 1 metre from any opening into the building (doors, windows, vents) per AS/NZS 5601.1. Must be in a well-ventilated outdoor area. Must not be in a position where it can be damaged by foot traffic or vehicles. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the outdoor renovation includes a natural gas BBQ connection. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 5601.1:2022 (gas installations). Licensed gasfitter required. Gas Compliance Certificate must be issued. Gas pressure/leak test required. Bayonet location must comply with clearance requirements. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Locating the bayonet too close to a door or window — minimum 1m clearance per AS/NZS 5601.1. (2) Not sizing the gas pipe correctly for the BBQ's MJ/hr rating — undersize pipe causes poor flame performance. (3) Using a flexible gas hose that is not rated for outdoor use or for the specific gas type (natural gas vs LPG). (4) Not issuing a Gas Compliance Certificate. (5) Not checking that the gas meter has sufficient capacity for the additional BBQ load. |

### D3. Garden Tap Relocation or Addition

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The relocation of existing garden taps (hose cocks) or the addition of new garden taps as part of an outdoor renovation. Garden taps may need to be relocated if the outdoor area layout changes, or additional taps may be added for convenience. |
| **What it involves** | Running a cold water supply pipe (DN15 or DN20) from the nearest internal supply point through the external wall to the new tap position. Installing a hose cock (garden tap) with backflow prevention. If the home has a rainwater tank, the garden tap may be connected to the rainwater supply (see D6). Capping the old tap position if being relocated. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Tap type:** 3/4" BSP hose cock, brass or chrome. With integral hose connection nozzle. **Backflow prevention:** Hose connection vacuum breaker (HVB) or dual-check valve, installed at the tap or on the supply line upstream. **Supply pipe:** DN15 or DN20 copper (outdoor-rated, UV-resistant). **Tap height:** Typically 400-500mm AFL for garden taps. Some homeowners prefer higher-mounted taps (800-1000mm) for easier bucket-filling. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — garden tap relocation/addition is a common request but not mandatory. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1. Backflow prevention required. Pipe material must be suitable for outdoor exposure. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not including backflow prevention. (2) Using PEX for exposed outdoor runs. (3) Not capping the old tap position when relocating. (4) Not considering whether the tap should be connected to mains or rainwater. |

---

### D4. Outdoor Shower

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | An outdoor shower installation, typically near a pool, at a beach house, or in a garden setting. Outdoor showers can range from a simple cold-water-only garden shower to a fully plumbed hot-and-cold fixture with mixer, drainage, and screening. |
| **What it involves** | **Cold water only (simple):** A cold water supply pipe (DN15) run to the outdoor shower position, with a shower head and valve. Drainage may be to a garden bed (soakaway) or to the stormwater system (if it is genuinely just water — no soap or chemicals). **Hot and cold (full):** Hot and cold supply pipes (DN15) run to the outdoor shower position, with a mixer valve. Requires a tempering valve if the hot water supply exceeds 50 degrees Celsius. Drainage must connect to the sewer system (not stormwater) if soap/shampoo is used, as this constitutes grey water. A floor waste grate and trapped waste pipe are required. **Materials:** All outdoor-exposed plumbing must use UV-resistant materials (copper pipe, stainless steel fittings). PEX must be run through protective conduit or inside wall cavities. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Supply:** DN15 copper. Mixer valve or simple tap valve. **Shower head:** Marine-grade stainless steel or brass for outdoor durability. **Drainage:** DN50 waste pipe with trap if connected to sewer. Gravel soakaway if cold-water-only and council permits. **Backflow prevention:** If the shower head can be submerged (e.g., hand-held shower on a hose), backflow prevention is required. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — only included if the outdoor renovation specifies an outdoor shower. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1 and 3500.2. Grey water (with soap) must drain to sewer. Tempering valve required if hot water is supplied. Backflow prevention as applicable. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Draining soapy shower water to the stormwater system — this is a compliance violation. (2) Not providing a tempering valve on the hot supply — scalding risk. (3) Using non-UV-resistant pipe and fittings that deteriorate in sunlight. (4) Not considering drainage — water pooling around an outdoor shower can cause structural damage, erosion, or mosquito breeding. |

---

### D5. Pool/Spa Plumbing

**Confidence: LOW**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Pool and spa plumbing is a specialist trade that typically falls outside the scope of a standard residential plumber. Pool plumbing involves pump and filter systems, chemical dosing, heating, and the pool shell's internal pipework. |
| **What it involves** | Pool plumbing is typically handled by a **pool builder or pool plumbing specialist**, not a general residential plumber. The scope items relevant to a general plumber include: water supply to fill the pool (a hose cock / garden tap near the pool — see D3); backflow prevention on the pool fill connection (pool water is a high hazard — an RPZ device is required if the fill hose can be submerged); and gas supply to a pool heater (gasfitter scope — similar to a gas hot water system). |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL / SPECIALIST** — pool plumbing is typically excluded from a general renovation plumbing scope. The general plumber's involvement is limited to the water supply fill connection and any gas supply for a pool heater. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Including pool plumbing in the general plumbing scope — it should be a separate specialist scope. (2) Not providing backflow prevention on the pool fill connection. (3) Not providing a gas supply for the pool heater (if gas-heated) — this must be included in the gasfitter's scope. |

### D6. Rainwater Tank Connection to Fixtures

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The connection of a rainwater tank to internal and external fixtures, allowing harvested rainwater to supply toilets, washing machines, garden taps, and other non-potable (or in some cases potable, with treatment) fixtures. Rainwater tank connections are increasingly common in Australian homes, driven by water conservation awareness, council requirements (particularly in new builds and major renovations), and the desire to reduce mains water usage. |
| **What it involves** | **External fixtures (garden taps):** A pump draws water from the rainwater tank and supplies it to external garden taps via a separate pipe system. This is the simplest connection and does not require integration with the internal plumbing. **Internal fixtures (toilet, washing machine):** A rainwater supply system is installed with a pump, pressure tank, and separate pipe runs to the toilet cistern and/or washing machine taps. The system must include mains water backup (automatic switching to mains water when the tank is empty) and cross-connection protection (backflow prevention between the rainwater supply and the mains water supply). **Labelling:** All rainwater supply pipes and outlets must be clearly labelled "RAINWATER — NOT SUITABLE FOR DRINKING" (unless the water is treated to potable standards). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pump:** Submersible or external pump, typically 0.5-1.0 HP. Pressure switch to maintain supply pressure. **Pipe sizing:** DN20 or DN25 for the main rainwater supply. DN15 for branches to individual fixtures. Typically PEX or copper. **Backflow prevention:** A **testable backflow prevention device** (RPZ or dual-check valve) must be installed at the mains water backup connection to prevent rainwater contaminating the mains supply. This is a requirement of the local water authority. **Mains water backup:** An automatic changeover device (trickle top-up valve or solenoid-controlled switch) that supplies mains water when the tank level is low. **Labelling:** All rainwater pipes, taps, and outlets must be labelled with "RAINWATER" identification per AS/NZS 3500.1. Purple/lilac-coloured pipe or tape is commonly used to identify rainwater supply lines. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — required where council mandates rainwater tank connection (common in new builds under BASIX in NSW, or equivalent in other states). Optional for renovations unless council requires it as a condition of approval. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 (water services — rainwater supply requirements). Local water authority requirements for backflow prevention and cross-connection control. Council requirements (BASIX, STORM, or equivalent). All rainwater supply pipework must be labelled. Annual testing of backflow prevention devices. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing backflow prevention between rainwater and mains supply — a serious compliance and health violation. (2) Not labelling rainwater supply pipes and outlets — a compliance requirement and a safety concern. (3) Connecting rainwater to fixtures without council approval or water authority notification. (4) Not providing mains water backup — when the tank runs empty, the toilet/washing machine will have no water supply. (5) Using the same colour pipe for rainwater and mains water — rainwater pipes should be purple/lilac or clearly marked. |

### D7. Stormwater Drainage Modifications

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Modifications to the property's stormwater drainage system as part of an outdoor renovation. Stormwater drainage collects rainwater from roofs, paved areas, and other hard surfaces and directs it to the council stormwater system, an on-site detention tank, or a legal point of discharge. |
| **What it involves** | Stormwater modifications may include: relocating or extending downpipe connections to accommodate a new outdoor roof structure (pergola, alfresco); installing new stormwater drainage pits and pipes for additional paved areas; connecting a rainwater tank overflow to the stormwater system; and modifying existing stormwater drainage that is impacted by the renovation (e.g., an old drain pipe running through the area where the new outdoor kitchen is being built). **Important:** Stormwater and sewer are completely separate systems in Australia. Stormwater must NEVER be connected to the sewer, and sewer must NEVER be connected to stormwater. Cross-connection is a serious offence. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Pipe:** DN90 (90mm) or DN100 (100mm) PVC stormwater pipe. Minimum fall 1:100 (10mm per metre) for DN100 pipe. **Pits:** Stormwater drainage pits (grated or solid lid) at collection points. PVC or concrete. **Grates:** Stormwater grate sizes vary by catchment area. **Connection:** The stormwater system must discharge to a legal point of discharge — typically the council's stormwater main in the street, a council-approved absorption trench, or an on-site detention (OSD) tank (if required by council). |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the outdoor renovation modifies the stormwater catchment (e.g., adding a new roof, paving a previously pervious area, or modifying existing drainage). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.3 (stormwater drainage). Council stormwater connection approval required for new or modified connections. The council may require an on-site detention (OSD) system if the impervious area is being increased. Stormwater must not be connected to the sewer. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not obtaining council approval for stormwater modifications. (2) Connecting stormwater to the sewer or vice versa. (3) Not providing adequate drainage for a new outdoor roof or paved area — water ponding and flooding. (4) Not considering the council's OSD requirements — if the total impervious area exceeds a threshold (varies by council), an OSD system may be required. (5) Blocking or damaging existing stormwater drainage during the renovation and not reinstating it. |

## E. Whole Home / General

This section covers plumbing scope items that are not specific to a single room but may be triggered by a renovation of any room, or that affect the entire property's plumbing system.

---

### E1. Hot Water System Replacement / Relocation

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The replacement of an existing hot water system (HWS) with a new unit, or the relocation of the HWS to a different position. This is one of the most common "whole home" plumbing scope items triggered by a renovation, particularly when: the existing HWS is old and due for replacement; the renovation changes the hot water demand profile (e.g., adding a second bathroom); the homeowner wants to switch fuel types (e.g., gas to electric heat pump); or the HWS location conflicts with the renovation (e.g., it is mounted on a wall that is being modified). |
| **What it involves** | **Like-for-like replacement (same type, same position):** Disconnecting the old HWS (water supply, hot water outlet, gas/electric connections, T&P relief valve discharge, and tempering valve if present), removing the old unit, installing the new unit in the same position, reconnecting all services, and commissioning. **Changeover (different type or fuel):** More complex. Involves disconnecting and removing the old system, plus potentially: running new gas pipe (if switching to gas), capping old gas pipe (if switching from gas), installing new electrical circuit (if switching to electric — electrician scope), installing new cold water and hot water pipes to suit the new unit's inlet/outlet positions, installing a new tempering valve (mandatory for all new HWS installations), installing a new T&P (temperature and pressure) relief valve and discharge pipe, and modifying or running a new condensate drain (for heat pump units). **Relocation:** Involves all changeover tasks plus running new supply and return pipes from the new HWS location to the existing hot water distribution manifold or pipe network. Longer pipe runs = more heat loss = consider pipe insulation. |
| **HWS types in Australia** | **Electric storage:** A tank (typically 125-400 litres) with an electric heating element. Connected to mains power (often on a controlled/off-peak tariff — electrician to wire). Requires cold water supply, hot water outlet, tempering valve, and T&P relief valve with discharge pipe. **Gas storage:** A tank with a gas burner. Connected to the gas supply (gasfitter to connect). Requires gas supply pipe (DN15 or DN20), cold water supply, hot water outlet, tempering valve, T&P relief valve with discharge, and a flue (internal or external, depending on the model). Indoor gas HWS requires a room-sealed (balanced flue) model per AS/NZS 5601.1. **Gas instantaneous (continuous flow):** A wall-mounted unit with no storage tank (heats water on demand). Brands: Rinnai, Bosch, Rheem. Connected to gas supply, cold water supply, and hot water outlet. Flue required (external mounting is standard for residential). Higher gas pipe sizing may be required due to peak flow rates. **Solar hot water:** Roof-mounted solar collectors with a storage tank (roof-mounted or ground-level). Requires: solar collector pipework to/from the tank, cold water supply, hot water outlet, tempering valve, T&P relief valve, and a booster (gas or electric) for days without sun. Plumber installs all pipework; electrician or gasfitter connects the booster. **Heat pump:** An outdoor unit (similar in appearance to an air conditioning compressor) that extracts heat from the air to heat water. Connected to mains power (electrician to wire). Requires cold water supply, hot water outlet, tempering valve, T&P relief valve, and a condensate drain. Heat pump units generate noise — placement must consider proximity to bedrooms and neighbours (check local council noise regulations). Government rebates and incentives are available for heat pump installations in most Australian states (e.g., VEU/VPP in VIC, ESS in NSW). |
| **Tempering valve** | A tempering valve is **mandatory** for all new and replacement HWS installations per AS/NZS 3500.4. See B8 above for full tempering valve details. |
| **T&P relief valve and discharge** | Every HWS must have a temperature and pressure (T&P) relief valve. This safety valve opens if the water temperature or pressure exceeds safe limits, preventing the tank from exploding. The T&P valve discharge pipe must: be the same diameter as the valve outlet (typically DN20); be run continuously downhill to a safe and visible discharge point (e.g., over a gully trap, floor waste, or to the exterior of the building where the discharge is visible); not be connected directly to the sewer or stormwater; and not have any valve or restriction installed on it. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — HWS replacement is not automatically part of every renovation, but it is commonly triggered by renovations. It becomes mandatory when: the existing HWS is being relocated; the renovation changes the hot water demand (adding fixtures); or the existing HWS is end-of-life and cannot serve the renovated property adequately. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 (heated water services). AS/NZS 5601.1:2022 (if gas). Tempering valve mandatory. T&P relief valve mandatory. Compliance Certificate required for all HWS installation and replacement work. Energy efficiency requirements per NCC (new HWS may need to meet minimum efficiency standards — check state requirements, particularly for electric resistance HWS which some states are phasing out). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing a tempering valve — mandatory for all new HWS installations. (2) Not running the T&P relief valve discharge to a safe, visible location — it must not be concealed or connected to a drain. (3) Not sizing the HWS correctly for the household's demand — an undersized system results in running out of hot water; an oversized system wastes energy. (4) Not considering the noise impact of a heat pump unit — they should not be placed near bedrooms or neighbouring properties. (5) Not checking government rebates before choosing a HWS type — significant rebates are available for heat pump and solar systems ($1,000-$3,000+ in many states). (6) Not insulating long hot water pipe runs — heat loss in uninsulated pipes wastes energy and water (waiting for hot water to arrive at the tap). (7) For gas HWS: not checking gas meter capacity for the new unit's demand. |

### E2. Main Water Meter and Isolation Valve

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The main water meter and isolation valve at the property boundary (or at the building entry for apartments). These are typically owned and maintained by the water authority, but the plumber may need to interact with them during a renovation, particularly to isolate the water supply for pipe modifications, to install a pressure limiting valve downstream, or to install a backflow prevention device. |
| **What it involves** | **During renovation:** The plumber will need to shut off the mains water supply at the water meter to make connections, cap pipes, or pressure-test. The main isolation valve (usually a gate valve or ball valve at or near the meter) is used for this purpose. If the main isolation valve is faulty (common in older properties — the valve seizes or does not fully close), the plumber must request the water authority to shut off supply at the street main (this usually incurs a fee and a scheduling delay). **Upgrading the main isolation valve:** If the existing main isolation valve is faulty, the plumber can replace it with a new ball valve (downstream of the meter — the meter itself is the water authority's property and must not be modified). |
| **Typical specifications** | **Main supply pipe:** DN20 (20mm) or DN25 (25mm) for a typical residential property. **Isolation valve:** Quarter-turn ball valve, DN20 or DN25. **Meter:** Water authority property — do not modify. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — the plumber will interact with the main isolation valve during virtually every renovation. Replacement of a faulty valve should be included in the scope if the existing valve does not operate correctly. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not testing the main isolation valve before starting work — if it is faulty, there is no way to shut off the water supply without calling the water authority (delay). (2) Attempting to modify the water meter (this is water authority property). (3) Not reinstating the meter box and surrounds after work is complete. |

---

### E3. Pressure Limiting Valve (PLV)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A pressure limiting valve (PLV), also called a pressure reducing valve (PRV), is a device that reduces the incoming mains water pressure to a safe level for the property's internal plumbing system. It is installed on the main supply pipe, typically near the water meter or at the point of entry to the building. |
| **When required** | **AS/NZS 3500.1:2025, Clause 3.3.4:** The static water pressure at any outlet (other than a fire service outlet) within a building must not exceed **500 kPa** (approximately 72 psi). If the mains water pressure at the property exceeds 500 kPa, a PLV is mandatory. **Practical application:** Mains water pressure varies by location and time of day. In many urban areas, particularly those on hilly terrain or close to water supply infrastructure, mains pressure routinely exceeds 500 kPa (sometimes reaching 700-1000+ kPa). All homes built since 2005 should have a PLV installed per AS/NZS 3500.1. Older homes may not have one and may be operating at excessive pressure. |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs a PLV on the main supply pipe immediately after the water meter/main isolation valve. The PLV reduces the incoming pressure to a preset level (typically **350-500 kPa** for residential properties). The PLV includes an adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the outlet pressure. A pressure gauge is often installed downstream to verify the operating pressure. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Valve size:** DN20 or DN25 to match the main supply pipe. **Preset pressure:** Typically 350-500 kPa (adjustable). Common setting: 500 kPa. **Brands:** AVG, RMC, Caleffi — commonly available through Reece, Tradelink, and Samios. **Installation position:** Immediately downstream of the water meter / main isolation valve. Must be accessible for maintenance and adjustment. |
| **Standard or optional** | **MANDATORY** if mains pressure exceeds 500 kPa. **RECOMMENDED** for all properties as a protective measure (even if current pressure is below 500 kPa, pressure fluctuations can cause transient spikes). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025, Clause 3.3.4. PLV must be WaterMark certified. Must be installed by a licensed plumber. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not checking the mains water pressure during a renovation — if it exceeds 500 kPa and there is no PLV, one must be installed. (2) Installing a PLV but not adjusting it to the correct pressure — factory settings may not be appropriate for the specific property. (3) Not installing a PLV at all in a property with high mains pressure — this causes: premature failure of flexible hoses, taps, and valves; water hammer (banging pipes); excessive water usage; and damage to appliances (dishwashers, washing machines, hot water systems). (4) Not making the PLV accessible for future maintenance and replacement. |

### E4. Backflow Prevention Devices

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A backflow prevention device protects the potable (drinking) water supply from contamination by preventing water from flowing backward through the plumbing system. Backflow can occur due to back-siphonage (negative pressure in the supply) or back-pressure (higher pressure downstream pushing water back up the supply). |
| **Hazard ratings** | AS/NZS 3500.1 classifies cross-connection hazards into three levels: **High hazard:** Risk of death (e.g., pool fill connections where the hose can be submerged, bidet connections, chemical dosing systems, irrigation systems connected to potable water). Requires an **RPZ (Reduced Pressure Zone)** device or equivalent — testable, with annual testing required. **Medium hazard:** Risk to health (e.g., some commercial processes, fire service connections). Requires a testable backflow device. **Low hazard:** Nuisance but not health risk (e.g., domestic garden hose with backflow preventer). Requires a non-testable device (hose vacuum breaker or dual check valve). |
| **Residential applications** | In a typical residential renovation, backflow prevention is required for: **Garden hose connections** — low hazard; hose vacuum breaker or dual check valve. **Pool/spa fill connections** — high hazard; RPZ device. **Rainwater tank cross-connection with mains** — medium to high hazard; testable backflow device at the mains connection. **Bidet installations** — high hazard; RPZ device (see B10). **Irrigation systems connected to potable water** — medium to high hazard (depending on whether the irrigation is above or below ground). |
| **2025 update** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 elevated Atmospheric Vacuum Breakers (AVBs) to high-hazard testable devices, giving plumbers more options for high-hazard backflow protection. |
| **Standard or optional** | **MANDATORY** where a cross-connection hazard exists. The plumber must assess the property for backflow hazards during any renovation and install appropriate protection. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025. Local water authority requirements (many water authorities maintain a register of backflow devices and require annual testing of testable devices). RPZ devices must be tested annually by a backflow-accredited plumber, with test reports submitted to the water authority. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not identifying backflow hazards during a renovation. (2) Not installing required backflow devices. (3) Installing a low-hazard device where a high-hazard device is required. (4) Not registering testable devices with the local water authority. (5) Not informing the homeowner of the annual testing obligation for RPZ and other testable devices. |

### E5. Sewer Connection Modifications

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Modifications to the property's sewer (sanitary drainage) connection as part of a renovation. This may involve connecting new fixtures to the existing sewer network, relocating drainage lines, or upgrading undersized or deteriorated sewer pipes. |
| **What it involves** | **New fixture connections:** Adding waste pipes from new or relocated fixtures to the existing sewer drainage network. Involves connecting to existing inspection openings (IOs), junction points, or running new branch drains to the main sewer line. **Main sewer line upgrade:** If the existing sewer line is old (clay, earthenware, or cast iron), undersized, or damaged (root intrusion, cracks, bellies), the renovation may trigger a partial or full sewer line replacement. Replacement is typically with DN100 PVC pipe. **Sewer inspection:** Before any renovation affecting the drainage, a CCTV sewer inspection (camera survey) is recommended to identify existing defects, blockages, or root intrusion in the sewer line. This identifies problems before they become emergencies during the renovation. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Sanitary drainage pipe:** DN100 (100mm) PVC for main sewer lines. DN50 (50mm) or DN40 (40mm) for fixture waste branches. Minimum fall: 1:60 for DN100, 1:40 for DN50. **Inspection openings (IOs):** Required at every change of direction, junction, and at maximum 20m intervals on straight runs per AS/NZS 3500.2. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the renovation adds fixtures, relocates fixtures, or the existing sewer infrastructure is inadequate. A CCTV inspection is optional but strongly recommended before major renovations. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.2 (sanitary plumbing and drainage). Council/water authority approval may be required for modifications to the sewer connection (the junction between the property's drain and the council sewer main is typically regulated). Inspection and certification required before covering drainage work. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not inspecting the existing sewer system before commencing renovation — discovering a collapsed sewer line during the renovation causes major delays and cost blowouts. (2) Not providing adequate fall on new drainage runs. (3) Not installing inspection openings at required locations. (4) Not obtaining council/water authority approval for sewer modifications. |

---

### E6. Gas Meter Relocation Considerations

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The relocation of the gas meter from its current position to a new position on the property. This may be required when the renovation modifies the area where the gas meter is currently located (e.g., building an extension over the meter, or the meter is in the way of a new outdoor kitchen). |
| **What it involves** | Gas meter relocation is performed by the **gas distribution company** (the network operator, not the plumber). In most states, the homeowner or plumber applies to the gas distributor (e.g., Jemena in NSW, Australian Gas Networks in SA, Multinet Gas in VIC, ATCO in WA) to relocate the meter. The gas distributor assesses the proposed new location, provides a quote, schedules the work, and performs the relocation. The plumber's role is limited to: requesting the relocation on behalf of the homeowner; modifying the downstream gas pipework (from the meter to the house) to suit the new meter position; and issuing a Gas Compliance Certificate for the modified downstream pipework. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Meter position requirements:** The new meter location must comply with AS/NZS 5601.1 requirements for clearances (e.g., minimum distances from doors, windows, ignition sources, and property boundaries). Must be in a ventilated, accessible location. Must not be in an enclosed room without adequate ventilation. **Lead time:** Gas meter relocation typically takes 4-8 weeks from application to completion — this must be factored into the renovation timeline. **Cost:** Typically $500-$2,000+ depending on the complexity of the relocation and the gas distributor's charges. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only required if the renovation conflicts with the current gas meter position. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not identifying the need for meter relocation early enough — the 4-8 week lead time can delay the entire renovation. (2) Assuming the plumber can relocate the meter — this is the gas distributor's scope, not the plumber's. (3) Not checking clearance requirements for the new meter position. |

### E7. Replacing Old Galvanised / Copper Pipes with PEX or Multilayer

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The replacement (repiping) of old, deteriorated galvanised steel or copper water supply pipes with modern PEX or multilayer pipe. This is a common whole-home scope item triggered by a renovation, particularly in older Australian homes (pre-1970s for galvanised, pre-1990s for older copper). |
| **Why it is triggered by renovation** | When a plumber opens up walls during a kitchen or bathroom renovation, they often discover: **Galvanised steel pipes** — corroded internally (reducing flow and water pressure), with rust-coloured water, pinhole leaks, or complete blockages. Galvanised pipes have a lifespan of approximately 40-60 years and are well past their service life in most Australian homes that still have them. **Older copper pipes** — showing signs of corrosion, pinhole leaks, or incompatible joints (e.g., copper connected directly to galvanised without a dielectric union, causing electrolytic corrosion). While copper can last 50-70 years, poor installation practices and aggressive water chemistry can shorten its life. |
| **What it involves** | **Partial repipe (renovation area only):** Replacing all old supply pipes within the renovation area (e.g., the kitchen or bathroom) with new PEX or multilayer pipe. Transition fittings are used where the new pipe connects to the existing old pipe in the wall or ceiling outside the renovation area. This is the minimum scope when old pipes are discovered during a renovation. **Full repipe (whole home):** Replacing all water supply pipes in the entire house from the main isolation valve to every fixture. This is more disruptive (requires opening walls throughout the house) but eliminates all future risk from deteriorated pipes. Often recommended if the galvanised pipes are severely corroded throughout the house. **Manifold system (optional upgrade):** Instead of a traditional branched pipe network, the new pipe is run from a central manifold (a distribution hub near the water meter or hot water system) with individual "home runs" to each fixture. Benefits: better water pressure, individual fixture isolation at the manifold, fewer joints in walls (reducing leak risk), and easier future maintenance. Slightly higher material cost due to longer pipe runs. |
| **Typical specifications** | **PEX-a (Engel method):** Most flexible PEX type. DN16 or DN20 for mains supply, DN16 for fixture branches. Expansion fittings (Uponor, Rehau). Excellent freeze resistance. Lifespan: 25-50 years. **PEX-b (Silane method):** Slightly stiffer than PEX-a. DN16 or DN20. Crimp or clamp ring fittings. Lower cost than PEX-a. **Multilayer (PEX-AL-PEX):** DN16 or DN20. Press-fit connections (Henco, Comap, Buteline). Shape-retaining (can be bent to shape and holds position). Lifespan: 50+ years (manufacturer claims). **Transition fittings:** Brass compression or push-fit fittings to connect new PEX/multilayer to existing copper or galvanised pipe. Dielectric unions or approved transition fittings must be used when connecting dissimilar metals to prevent electrolytic corrosion. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — triggered when old deteriorated pipes are discovered during a renovation. The plumber should assess the condition of all visible pipes during the renovation and recommend partial or full repiping if deterioration is found. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS/NZS 3500.1:2025 (water services). All pipe materials and fittings must be WaterMark certified. Pressure testing required on all new pipework. PEX pipe must not be exposed to UV light — run through wall cavities, under floors, or through protective conduit. Transition fittings between dissimilar metals must prevent electrolytic corrosion. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not assessing the condition of existing pipes during a renovation — deteriorated pipes are a ticking time bomb that should be addressed while the walls are open. (2) Connecting new PEX directly to old galvanised pipe without a proper transition fitting — causes electrolytic corrosion at the joint. (3) Not pressure-testing new pipework before closing walls. (4) Exposing PEX to UV light during or after installation. (5) Not insulating hot water pipes — heat loss in uninsulated pipes wastes energy and water. (6) Doing only a partial repipe when the rest of the house's pipes are equally deteriorated — the homeowner should be informed of the full picture and given the option to repipe the entire house while trades are on-site. |

## Plumbing Scope — Key Exclusions

The following items are commonly **excluded** from a residential plumbing scope-of-works and should be clearly noted as exclusions in any plumbing scope document:

1. **Electrical work** — including power points for dishwashers, waste disposal units, instant boiling water units, heated towel rails (electric), bidet seats, and hot water systems. Electrical work is a separate scope requiring a licensed electrician.
2. **Waterproofing** — while the plumber performs work that interacts with waterproofing (puddle flanges, penetrations), the waterproofing membrane application is typically a separate trade (licensed waterproofer).
3. **Tiling** — all tile work is a separate trade.
4. **Cabinetry and benchtops** — the plumber works around cabinetry and through benchtop penetrations, but the cabinet maker and stone mason are separate trades.
5. **Pool and spa plumbing** — specialist scope (unless limited to water supply fill connection and gas for heater).
6. **Fire services plumbing** — fire sprinkler systems, fire hydrants, and hose reels are specialist scope.
7. **Stormwater drainage** — while the plumber may perform stormwater work, it is often a separate scope item (and may require a separate licence in some states — e.g., in NSW, plumbers hold separate "plumber" and "drainer" endorsements).
8. **Fixture supply** — the plumber's scope typically covers labour and pipe materials. The actual fixtures (taps, sinks, toilets, baths, shower mixers) are usually client-supplied or specified by the designer. The scope should clearly state whether fixtures are included or excluded.
9. **Remediation of pre-existing defects** — if the plumber discovers issues during the renovation (e.g., cracked sewer line, asbestos pipe lagging, structural damage), remediation is typically outside the original scope and requires a variation.
10. **Council and water authority fees** — permit fees, connection fees, and inspection fees are typically passed through to the homeowner and are not included in the plumber's quote.
