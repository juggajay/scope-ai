## 1. Types Available in Australia

### 1.1 Electric Storage

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer data, AS/NZS 3000 references)

Electric storage hot water systems heat water using one or two immersion elements inside an insulated tank. They are the most common type in Australia, used by approximately 50% of households. They are the cheapest to purchase and install but generally the most expensive to run (unless powered by solar PV).

#### 1.1.1 Available Sizes

| Tank Size | Suitable For | Typical Dimensions (H x W) | Filled Weight |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 25L | Single point-of-use (under-sink) | ~500 x 350mm | ~35 kg |
| 50L | 1 person, small unit | ~600 x 400mm | ~65 kg |
| 80L | 1-2 people | ~800 x 450mm | ~100 kg |
| 125L | 2-3 people | ~1100 x 500mm | ~150 kg |
| 160L | 2-4 people | ~1200 x 560mm | ~190 kg |
| 250L | 3-5 people | ~1400 x 640mm | ~290 kg |
| 315L | 4-6 people | ~1640 x 640mm | ~360 kg |
| 400L | 5-8 people | ~1700 x 680mm | ~450 kg |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.1.2 Installation Locations

| Location | Requirements | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Outdoor** | Must be weather-rated (galvanised outer jacket or stainless steel). Requires UV-stable pressure/temperature relief valve (PTR) drain line. Concrete slab or paver base (minimum 50mm thick) | Most common for 250L+ units |
| **Indoor (garage/laundry)** | Requires safe tray/drip tray connected to drainage. Adequate ventilation for PTR discharge. Must not obstruct egress | Common for smaller units (25-160L) |
| **Indoor (cupboard)** | Must have safe tray. PTR drain line to gully or external drain. Access for maintenance. Minimum 25mm clearance on all sides | Primarily point-of-use units (25-80L) |
| **Roof space** | NOT recommended for storage HWS due to weight, maintenance access, and leak risk | Extremely rare in residential |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.1.3 Electrical Circuit Requirements

| Element Wattage | Circuit Breaker | Cable Size (typical) | Plug/Hardwired | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| 1.8 kW | 10A dedicated | 2.5mm2 TPS | 10A plug | Small point-of-use units only |
| 2.4 kW | 15A dedicated | 2.5mm2 TPS | 15A plug or hardwired | Common for heat pump backup elements |
| 3.6 kW | 20A dedicated | 4mm2 TPS | Hardwired | **Most common residential** -- 250L, 315L units |
| 4.8 kW | 25A or 32A dedicated | 6mm2 TPS | Hardwired | Twin-element or high-recovery units |
| 2 x 3.6 kW (twin element) | 20A dedicated per element OR single 32A | 4mm2 or 6mm2 TPS | Hardwired | Twin-element 315L/400L units |
| 2 x 4.8 kW (twin element) | 32A dedicated per element | 6mm2 TPS | Hardwired | High-capacity 400L units |

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 3000 requirements for dedicated circuits)

**Key points:**
- AS/NZS 3000 requires a **dedicated circuit** for every hot water system -- no other loads on the same circuit
- All hot water circuits must be RCD protected (30mA) under AS/NZS 3000:2018
- Off-peak/controlled load circuits require a separate meter element or controlled load relay from the distribution network service provider (DNSP)
- The most common residential configuration is a single 3.6 kW element on a 20A circuit breaker with 4mm2 cable

#### 1.1.4 Off-Peak / Controlled Load Tariffs

| Tariff Type | Availability Window | Rate Discount | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Controlled Load 1 (CL1)** | Overnight only (typically 10pm-7am, 8 hours) | 50-70% cheaper than peak | Most common. Hot water heats overnight. May run out in late afternoon |
| **Controlled Load 2 (CL2)** | Overnight + daytime boost (typically 10pm-7am + 11am-3pm) | 40-60% cheaper than peak | Better for larger households. Less risk of running out |
| **Continuous/Anytime** | 24/7 availability | No discount (standard rate) | Used when HWS is on general circuit. Higher running costs |
| **Solar sponge** | Midday window (10am-3pm) aligned with solar generation | Varies | Growing in popularity for heat pumps with timer/solar integration |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies by DNSP and retailer)

**Scope impact:** When specifying electrical work, the electrician must know which tariff arrangement the homeowner wants. This affects:
- Whether a separate controlled load meter element is needed
- Whether a load control relay/ripple receiver is required
- The wiring run from the meter board to the HWS

#### 1.1.5 Key Specifications to Note

| Specification | Typical Range | Why It Matters |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| First hour delivery (@ 45C rise) | 140-320L depending on element/tank size | How much usable hot water in first hour of heavy use |
| Recovery rate | 20-30L per hour per kW of element | How fast the tank reheats. A 3.6kW element recovers ~105L/hr |
| Standing heat loss | 0.8-1.5 kWh/day (250L tank) | Energy lost through insulation while idle |
| Insulation thickness | 40-50mm polyurethane foam | Thicker = less standing loss, lower running costs |
| Anode type | Sacrificial (magnesium or aluminium) | Must be inspected every 2-3 years, replaced every 3-5 years |
| Tank lining | Vitreous enamel or stainless steel | Stainless steel = longer life, higher cost. Enamel = standard |
| PTR valve setting | 850 kPa / 99C (standard) | Must match unit rating. Drain line must be visible and unobstructed |

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 1.2 Gas Storage

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer data, AS/NZS 5601.1 references)

Gas storage hot water systems heat water using a gas burner beneath or within a storage tank. They are available in natural gas (NG) and LPG configurations. They are generally less efficient than gas instantaneous systems due to significant standing heat losses, particularly in cold climates where the gas flame must continuously overcome heat loss through the tank walls and the uninsulatable flue passage.

#### 1.2.1 Continuous Flow vs Storage (Gas)

| Feature | Gas Storage | Gas Continuous Flow |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **How it works** | Heats and stores a fixed volume of water in an insulated tank | Heats water on demand as it flows through a heat exchanger |
| **Efficiency** | 3-5 star (significant standby losses through flue and tank walls) | 5-7 star (no standby losses -- only heats when needed) |
| **Hot water supply** | Limited by tank size. Can run out during heavy use | Unlimited -- continuous supply as long as gas is available |
| **Recovery time** | 30-60 minutes for full reheat | Instant -- no recovery needed |
| **Size/footprint** | Large -- tank requires floor space (420-500mm diameter) | Compact -- wall-mounted (typically 350 x 600 x 225mm) |
| **Typical lifespan** | 8-12 years | 15-20 years |
| **Installed cost** | $1,200 - $2,200 | $1,400 - $2,500 |
| **Best for** | Existing gas connections where space is available | Most gas-connected homes; multi-bathroom households |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.2.2 Flue Requirements

Gas hot water systems produce combustion gases that must be safely vented. The flue type dictates where the unit can be installed.

| Flue Type | Description | Installation Location | Clearance Requirements | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Open flue (natural draught)** | Combustion air drawn from surrounding room. Exhaust rises naturally through a vertical flue | **Outdoor only** (or in permanently ventilated enclosure with >100mm low-level and high-level vents) | 500mm from any opening (window, door, vent) for <150 MJ/h input. 1500mm for >=150 MJ/h | Most common for residential gas storage. AS/NZS 5601.1 Figure 6.2 |
| **Room-sealed (balanced flue)** | Sealed combustion chamber. Air intake and exhaust via concentric flue terminal through wall | **Indoor or outdoor** | Terminal: 450mm from property boundary. 500mm from any opening for <150 MJ/h. 300mm from ground level | Allows indoor installation. More expensive units. Required for enclosed spaces |
| **Fan-forced flue** | Fan assists exhaust discharge. Can use horizontal or vertical flue runs | **Indoor or outdoor** | Terminal clearances per AS/NZS 5601.1. Can discharge horizontally through wall. 500mm from openings | Used on many continuous flow units. Allows flexible flue routing |
| **Flueless** | Small capacity units (<10L). No flue required | **Indoor** in ventilated room | Room must have permanent ventilation openings | Rare. Only for very small under-sink units |

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 5601.1:2013 references)

**Key clearance requirements (AS/NZS 5601.1:2013, Figure 6.2):**

| Measurement | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Flue terminal to openable window or door (appliance <150 MJ/h) | Minimum 500mm horizontally and vertically |
| Flue terminal to openable window or door (appliance >=150 MJ/h) | Minimum 1500mm horizontally and vertically |
| Flue terminal to property boundary | Minimum 450mm |
| Flue terminal to ground level | Minimum 300mm |
| Flue terminal to eaves/soffit (direct above) | Minimum 300mm |
| Flue terminal to building corner | Minimum 150mm |
| Appliance to combustible wall (rear) | Minimum 25-50mm (refer to appliance data plate) |
| Appliance to combustible wall (side) | Minimum 25-50mm (refer to appliance data plate) |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.2.3 Energy Star Ratings

| Star Rating | Description | Typical Gas Consumption (250L equivalent) |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| 3 star | Older/basic models | ~18-20 MJ/day |
| 4 star | Mid-range efficiency | ~14-16 MJ/day |
| 5 star | High efficiency storage | ~12-14 MJ/day |
| 5-6 star | Premium storage / instantaneous | ~10-12 MJ/day |
| 6+ star | Top-rated instantaneous | ~8-10 MJ/day |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (indicative -- varies by model, climate zone, and usage)

#### 1.2.4 Gas Supply Requirements

| Requirement | Natural Gas | LPG |
|------------|------------|-----|
| Supply pressure | 1.13 kPa (typical residential) | 2.75 kPa (typical residential) |
| Gas meter capacity | Must supply total household demand including HWS | N/A (cylinders) |
| Pipe sizing | Must be sized per AS/NZS 5601.1 for total demand. Typical 20mm for single appliance run <10m | Must be sized per AS/NZS 5601.1. Copper or approved PE |
| Isolation valve | Required within 1m of appliance | Required within 1m of appliance |
| Gas connection type | 20mm BSP male (typical) | 20mm BSP male or 3/8" SAE flare (varies) |
| Regulator | Network regulator at meter. Some appliances have internal regulator | Cylinder regulator required. Two-stage recommended for long runs |

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 1.3 Gas Instantaneous (Continuous Flow)

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer specifications, industry data)

Gas continuous flow (instantaneous) systems are the most energy-efficient gas hot water option. They heat water on demand as it flows through a compact heat exchanger, consuming gas only when a hot tap is opened. They are wall-mounted, space-efficient, and provide unlimited hot water. Three brands dominate the Australian market: **Rinnai**, **Rheem**, and **Bosch**.

#### 1.3.1 How They Work

1. Hot tap is opened, creating water flow through the unit
2. Flow sensor detects flow above the minimum activation rate (typically 2.5-3.0 L/min)
3. Electronic ignition fires the gas burner
4. Water passes through the heat exchanger, heating to the set temperature
5. Temperature sensor modulates gas flow to maintain consistent output temperature
6. When taps are closed, the burner shuts off

#### 1.3.2 Installation Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Mounting** | Wall-mounted on non-combustible backing or with appropriate clearances from combustible surfaces (typically 25-50mm sides, 150mm above, 200mm below) |
| **Location** | Externally mounted (most common). Some room-sealed models can be installed internally |
| **Gas supply** | Must be sized for the unit's maximum gas consumption. A 26L unit typically requires 199 MJ/h input -- verify gas meter and pipe sizing can supply this |
| **Water supply** | Minimum 200 kPa dynamic pressure. Maximum 800 kPa static pressure. Pressure limiting valve (PLV) required if mains pressure exceeds rating |
| **Electrical** | 240V 10A GPO within 1.5m (most units have a 3-pin plug). Some units are battery ignition (no power required) |
| **Condensate drain** | Not required for standard units. Required for condensing models |
| **Flue clearances** | Per AS/NZS 5601.1 Figure 6.2 (see Section 1.2.2 above) |
| **Accessibility** | Must be accessible for servicing. Minimum 500mm clear space in front of unit |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.3.3 Flow Rate and Temperature Rise

The rated flow rate of a continuous flow unit is specified at a particular temperature rise (typically 25C rise). Actual usable flow rate depends on incoming cold water temperature.

| Unit Rating | Flow Rate @ 25C Rise | Flow Rate @ 35C Rise | Flow Rate @ 45C Rise | Typical Use Case |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **16L** | 16 L/min | 11.4 L/min | 8.9 L/min | 1 bathroom home |
| **20L** | 20 L/min | 14.3 L/min | 11.1 L/min | 1-2 bathroom home |
| **26L** | 26 L/min | 18.6 L/min | 14.4 L/min | 2-3 bathroom home (most popular) |
| **32L** | 32 L/min | 22.9 L/min | 17.8 L/min | 3+ bathroom home or high simultaneous demand |

**Temperature rise calculation:**
- Temperature rise = Desired output temp - Incoming cold water temp
- Example: 50C output desired, 15C incoming = 35C rise
- At 35C rise, a 26L unit delivers ~18.6 L/min (enough for 2 showers simultaneously at ~9 L/min each)

**Cold water inlet temperatures by region (approximate winter minimums):**

| Region | Winter Cold Water Temp | Summer Cold Water Temp |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| North Queensland | 20-22C | 28-30C |
| South Queensland / Northern NSW | 15-18C | 24-26C |
| Sydney / Central NSW | 12-15C | 20-22C |
| Melbourne / Southern VIC | 8-12C | 18-20C |
| Adelaide | 10-14C | 20-22C |
| Perth | 14-17C | 22-25C |
| Hobart / Tasmania | 6-10C | 16-18C |
| Canberra | 5-9C | 18-20C |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies by year and specific location)

**Scope impact:** In colder climates (Melbourne, Hobart, Canberra), a 26L unit may only deliver ~14-16 L/min in winter. If the renovation adds bathrooms, consider a 32L unit or manifold system.

#### 1.3.4 Manifold Systems (Multi-Unit)

For large homes or commercial-scale residential, multiple continuous flow units can be manifolded together:

| Configuration | Total Capacity | Use Case | Additional Requirements |
|--------------|---------------|----------|----------------------|
| 2 x 26L manifolded | Up to 52 L/min @ 25C rise | 3-4 bathroom home | Manifold kit, larger gas supply, communication cable between units |
| 3 x 26L manifolded | Up to 78 L/min @ 25C rise | 5+ bathroom home / dual occupancy | Manifold kit, significantly larger gas meter and pipe sizing |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.3.5 Minimum Flow Rate Considerations

| Concern | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Minimum activation flow** | Most units require 2.5-3.0 L/min before the burner ignites. Below this, cold water only |
| **Low-flow fixtures** | Some low-flow taps (WELS 5-6 star) may not reach minimum activation. Check WELS rating against unit minimum flow |
| **Single tap operation** | Basin taps may not trigger ignition if flow is too low. Not an issue with shower heads (typically 7-9 L/min) |
| **Temperature fluctuation** | Brief temperature fluctuations ("cold water sandwich") can occur during sequential tap operations. Premium models (e.g., Rinnai Infinity with PureTemp) minimise this |

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 1.4 Heat Pump

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer specifications, government resources)

Heat pump hot water systems use a refrigeration cycle to extract heat from ambient air and transfer it to the water tank. They are the most energy-efficient electric hot water option, using 60-75% less electricity than a conventional electric storage system. They are the primary recommendation for electrification and are eligible for substantial government rebates across all Australian states.

#### 1.4.1 How They Work

1. A fan draws ambient air across an evaporator coil containing cold refrigerant
2. The refrigerant absorbs heat from the air and evaporates
3. A compressor increases the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant gas
4. The hot refrigerant passes through a condenser coil wrapped around or inside the water tank, transferring heat to the water
5. The refrigerant cools, condenses back to liquid, and cycles back to the evaporator
6. A backup electric element provides boost heating when ambient temperatures are very low or demand is very high

#### 1.4.2 Noise Requirements and Positioning

**Confidence:** HIGH (EPA guidelines, manufacturer specifications)

| Specification | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **Sound pressure level (@ 1m)** | 37-55 dB(A) | Premium units (Reclaim, Sanden): 37 dB(A). Budget units: 45-55 dB(A) |
| **Sound power level (EN 12102)** | 50-65 dB(A) | Higher number but measured differently -- total sound output |

**Noise context:**

| dB(A) Level | Equivalent Sound |
|------------|-----------------|
| 30 dB(A) | Whisper |
| 37 dB(A) | Quiet library (Reclaim, Sanden level) |
| 40 dB(A) | Quiet residential area at night |
| 45-48 dB(A) | Moderate rainfall / quiet conversation (iStore, Rinnai level) |
| 50-55 dB(A) | Normal conversation / dishwasher (Stiebel Eltron, Dux level) |
| 60 dB(A) | Air conditioning unit |

**Positioning and clearance requirements:**

| Clearance | Minimum Distance | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| From bedroom windows (own property) | 1.5m minimum, 3m+ preferred | Sound travels. Corner placement near garage/laundry ideal |
| From neighbour's bedroom windows | 3m+ preferred | Check local council EPA noise requirements |
| From property boundary fence | 1m minimum (some councils require more) | Check local planning requirements |
| From walls/obstructions (air intake side) | 500mm | Restricted airflow reduces efficiency and increases noise |
| From walls/obstructions (other sides) | 100-300mm (model dependent) | Check manufacturer installation manual |
| Ground clearance | 100mm minimum | Prevents debris ingress, allows drainage |
| Overhead clearance | 500mm minimum (for integrated units) | For air circulation and maintenance access |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies by council and specific model)

**Scope impact for positioning:**
- Must be installed outdoors (for integrated units) or with outdoor compressor (for split systems)
- Avoid placing adjacent to bedrooms, studies, or shared fences
- Corner placement near garages, laundries, or garden areas is ideal
- Coastal installations: check manufacturer corrosion warranty. Some units require a sacrificial anode or corrosion-resistant coating in salt-laden air environments

#### 1.4.3 Efficiency Ratings (COP)

The Coefficient of Performance (COP) measures how much heat energy a heat pump produces per unit of electrical energy consumed.

| COP Value | Meaning | Typical System |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| COP 2.5 | Produces 2.5 kW of heat per 1 kW of electricity | Older/budget models (Dux Airoheat) |
| COP 3.0 | 3:1 ratio | Mid-range (Stiebel Eltron WWK) |
| COP 4.0-4.5 | 4-4.5:1 ratio | Good performance (Rheem Ambiheat, iStore) |
| COP 5.0-5.2 | 5-5.2:1 ratio | High performance (Sanden, Rheem AmbiPower) |
| COP 6.0+ | 6+:1 ratio | Premium CO2 systems (Sanden at optimal conditions) |
| COP 7.5 | 7.5:1 ratio (claimed) | Manufacturer-claimed peak (Rinnai Hotflo Plus) |

**Important COP caveats:**
- COP is measured at specific test conditions (typically EN 16147 at A20/W55 -- 20C ambient, heating to 55C)
- Real-world COP is lower than lab conditions, especially in cold climates
- COP drops as ambient temperature decreases:

| Ambient Temperature | Typical COP Range |
|--------------------|------------------|
| 30C+ | COP 4.0 - 6.0 (peak efficiency) |
| 20C | COP 3.5 - 5.0 (rated conditions) |
| 10C | COP 2.5 - 3.5 |
| 5C | COP 2.0 - 3.0 |
| 0C | COP 1.5 - 2.5 |
| -5C | COP 1.2 - 2.0 (minimum operating temp for most units) |
| Below -5C | Backup element operates (COP effectively 1.0) |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (real-world COP varies significantly with conditions)

#### 1.4.4 Defrost Cycles and Cold Climate Performance

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Defrost trigger** | When frost forms on the evaporator coil (typically below 5C ambient with high humidity) |
| **Defrost method** | Reverse-cycle (most units) or hot-gas bypass |
| **Defrost frequency** | Every 30-90 minutes during heating in frosty conditions |
| **Defrost energy penalty** | 5-15% reduction in overall efficiency during defrost operation |
| **Minimum operating temp (heat pump mode)** | -5C to -7C for most units. Below this, backup element operates |
| **Cold climate recommendations** | Choose units with CO2 refrigerant (Sanden, Reclaim) or units rated for cold climates. Ensure tank is well-insulated (>50mm foam). Consider insulating hot water pipe runs |

**Performance by Australian climate zone:**

| Zone | Cities | Heat Pump Suitability | Notes |
|------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Zone 1 (Hot Humid) | Darwin, Cairns | Excellent | COP stays high year-round. Rarely needs backup element |
| Zone 2 (Warm Humid) | Brisbane, Gold Coast | Excellent | Very efficient. 1-2 cool months but rarely below 10C |
| Zone 3 (Hot Dry / Warm Temperate) | Sydney, Perth | Very Good | Good year-round performance. Brief cool snaps in winter |
| Zone 4 (Mild Temperate) | Melbourne, Adelaide | Good | COP drops in winter (5-10C mornings). Still 2-3x more efficient than electric element |
| Zone 5 (Cool Temperate) | Hobart, Canberra | Adequate | COP drops significantly in winter (frequent sub-zero). CO2 units recommended. Element may run 2-3 months of the year |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

#### 1.4.5 Rebate Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for STCs and most state rebates, a heat pump must:

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| Be listed on the Clean Energy Regulator's register | Check the CER product list before specifying |
| Meet minimum performance requirements | Varies by scheme. Generally COP >2.5 at rated conditions |

### 1.5 Solar Hot Water

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer and government data)

Solar hot water systems use solar collectors (mounted on the roof or on a frame) to heat water using sunlight. They require a booster (electric or gas) for cloudy days and high-demand periods. They consist of two main components: collectors and a storage tank.

#### 1.5.1 System Configurations

| Configuration | Description | Tank Location | Collector Location | Pros | Cons |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------|------|
| **Close-coupled (thermosiphon)** | Tank sits directly above collectors on the roof | Roof | Roof | Simple, no pump needed, lower cost | Very heavy on roof (300-420 kg filled). Visual impact. Roof strength must be verified |
| **Split system** | Collectors on roof, tank on ground | Ground level | Roof | Lower roof loading. Easier maintenance. Less visual impact | Requires circulation pump and controller. More complex plumbing |
| **Heat pump + solar PV** | Heat pump heated by excess solar PV electricity (not traditional solar thermal) | Ground level | Solar PV panels on roof | Simpler installation than solar thermal. Uses existing PV. Timer-controlled | Not technically "solar hot water" but achieves similar outcome. Requires adequate PV capacity |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.5.2 Collector Types

| Collector Type | Description | Efficiency | Best Climate | Approximate Cost (pair) | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Flat plate** | Dark absorber plate under a glass cover with insulated backing. Water or glycol circulates through tubes bonded to the plate | Good in warm climates. Less effective in overcast conditions | Warm/hot climates (Zones 1-3) | $1,500 - $2,500 | Durable. 20+ year lifespan. Simpler construction. Heavier |
| **Evacuated tube** | Glass tubes with a vacuum layer for insulation. Heat pipe transfers heat to a manifold | Better in cold/overcast climates. Less affected by ambient temperature | All climates, especially cool (Zones 4-5) | $2,000 - $3,500 | Lighter per unit area. Individual tubes replaceable. Can be angled more freely. More fragile |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.5.3 Roof Requirements

| Requirement | Detail | Impact on Scope |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Orientation** | North-facing is ideal. North-west or north-east acceptable (10-15% efficiency loss). West-facing acceptable with increased collector area | May require additional collectors on non-north roof. East-facing is poor |
| **Tilt angle** | 20-40 degrees optimal for most of Australia. Ideally latitude angle or latitude +10 degrees for winter optimisation | Roof pitch may need adjusting or mounting frame provided |
| **Shading** | No significant shading between 9am-3pm (especially 10am-2pm peak). Assess trees, neighbouring buildings, chimneys, antennas | Shading assessment required. May need tree trimming or alternative collector location |
| **Roof strength (close-coupled)** | Must support 300-420 kg (full tank + collectors). Rafters may need bracing or additional support. Structural assessment recommended | Scope must include structural assessment. May need rafter reinforcement by carpenter |
| **Roof strength (split system)** | Collectors only on roof: typically 30-60 kg per panel. Most roofs can support this without modification | Usually no structural work needed |
| **Roof material** | Must be compatible with mounting brackets. Tile, metal, and flat roofs all have different bracket systems | Specify correct bracket type in scope. Ensure no roof penetration leaks |
| **Collector area** | Typically 2-4 m2 for a residential system (2 collectors). More in cooler climates | Must have uninterrupted roof space of sufficient area |
| **Pipe penetrations** | Flow and return pipes must penetrate roof. Flashing and waterproofing required | Include roof penetration waterproofing in scope |

**Confidence:** HIGH

#### 1.5.4 Booster Types

| Booster Type | How It Works | Energy Use | Best For | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Electric booster (in-tank element)** | 1.8-3.6 kW element inside the storage tank. Thermostat controlled. Can be on off-peak tariff | 30-50% of equivalent electric-only system | Most installations. Simple. Reliable | Can be connected to controlled load tariff for cost savings |
| **Gas booster (in-tank)** | Gas burner beneath storage tank (only on gas-boosted solar systems) | 30-50% of equivalent gas-only system | Where gas connection exists and is preferred | Requires gas connection, flue, clearances |
| **Gas booster (instantaneous in-line)** | Continuous flow gas unit connected in series after solar tank. Only fires if solar-heated water is below set temperature | 20-40% of equivalent gas-only system | Best efficiency. Only uses gas when solar output is insufficient | More complex plumbing. Two-unit system. Higher install cost |

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 3. When Does a Renovation Trigger a Hot Water Upgrade?

**Confidence:** HIGH (industry practice and regulatory requirements)

During a renovation, the hot water system should be assessed for replacement or upgrade. The following triggers indicate when a hot water upgrade should be included in the scope.

### 3.1 Age-Based Triggers

| System Type | Expected Lifespan | Recommend Replacement When | Rationale |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Electric storage | 8-12 years | > 8 years during a major renovation | Likely to fail within the renovation payback period. Better to replace proactively than reactively |
| Gas storage | 8-12 years | > 8 years during a major renovation | Same reasoning. Gas storage units lose efficiency as they age |
| Gas continuous flow | 15-20 years | > 12-15 years during a major renovation | Longer lifespan but heat exchanger efficiency degrades |
| Heat pump | 10-15 years | > 10 years during a major renovation | Compressor and refrigerant system degradation |
| Solar thermal | 15-20 years (collectors), 10-15 years (tank) | Tank > 10 years. Collectors > 15 years | Often the tank needs replacing while collectors are still functional |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.2 Capacity Triggers

A renovation may change the household's hot water demand, triggering an upgrade:

| Renovation Change | Impact on Hot Water Demand | Action Required |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Adding a bathroom | +100-150L daily demand | Verify existing system can service additional bathroom. If undersized, upgrade to larger unit or continuous flow |
| Adding a second dwelling / granny flat | +200-300L daily demand | Separate HW system for second dwelling, or significant upgrade to existing |
| Upgrading to a spa bath | +200-400L per fill | Standard storage tank will not fill a spa bath. May need larger tank or continuous flow |
| Kitchen renovation with dishwasher | +15-30L per cycle | Usually handled by existing system. Only a concern if system is already at capacity |
| Laundry renovation | Minimal impact if replacing like-for-like | Only a concern if adding additional washing machine or moving from cold-wash to hot-wash laundry |
| Converting single bathroom to ensuite + main | +100-150L daily demand | Same as adding a bathroom |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.3 Compliance Triggers

| Trigger | Regulation | Action Required |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Any new heated water work** | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 | All new heated water installations must comply with current standard. Tempering valves required on all personal hygiene outlets |
| **Hot water system replacement** | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 | Replacement triggers full compliance with current standard including tempering, PTR valve drain, delivery temperatures |
| **Adding new outlets** | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025, NCC Vol 3 Part B2 | New outlets receiving heated water must have temperature control. Pipe sizing must be verified |
| **Moving hot water system location** | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025, AS/NZS 5601.1 (gas) | New location must meet all current clearance, ventilation, and drainage requirements |
| **Switching fuel type** | AS/NZS 3000 (electrical), AS/NZS 5601.1 (gas) | New infrastructure required (electrical circuit or gas supply). Compliance certificates required |
| **State-specific GEMS registration** | Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act 2012 | All new hot water systems must meet minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and be registered |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.4 Fuel Switching Triggers

| Scenario | Why Switch? | Considerations |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Electric storage to heat pump** | Reduce running costs by 60-75%. Access rebates. Environmental improvement | Must check clearances, noise, electrical circuit, condensate drainage |
| **Gas storage to gas continuous flow** | Unlimited hot water. Better efficiency. Free up floor space. Gas storage is the least efficient option | Gas supply sizing. Flue clearances. Electrical connection for ignition |
| **Gas (any) to heat pump** | Electrification. Gas phase-out (Victoria). Reduce running costs. Access rebates | Gas decommissioning scope. New electrical circuit. Location change likely. Condensate drain |
| **Gas (any) to electric (any)** | Electrification. Simplicity | New electrical circuit. Gas decommissioning if disconnecting gas entirely |
| **Electric storage to solar thermal** | Lowest running costs. Environmental. Rebates | Roof assessment. Complex installation. Higher upfront cost. Maintenance of collectors |
| **Any type to heat pump + solar PV** | Optimal combination: heat pump COP + free solar electricity | Timer-controlled heat pump runs during solar generation hours (10am-2pm) |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.5 Warning Signs for Replacement

The AI scope generator should flag hot water replacement if the homeowner reports any of these:

| Warning Sign | Severity | Recommended Action |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Rusty or discoloured hot water | High | Tank corrosion. Replace immediately. Do not repair |
| Leaking from tank body (not fittings) | Critical | Tank failure imminent/occurring. Emergency replacement |
| Rumbling, popping, or banging noises | Medium | Sediment buildup. May be salvageable with flush, but replacement recommended if > 8 years old |
| Inconsistent temperature | Medium | Thermostat or element failure. Repair possible, but replace if unit is aged |
| Running out of hot water much faster than usual | Medium | Element failure, sediment buildup, or broken dip tube. Assess based on age |
| Visible corrosion on external fittings or tank body | Medium-High | Indicates internal corrosion also occurring. Plan for replacement |
| PTR valve dripping constantly | Medium | Valve may need replacement ($50-100), or indicates excessive pressure/temperature. Investigate root cause |
| Pilot light won't stay lit (gas) | Medium | Thermocouple failure. Repairable ($150-250) but assess overall unit age |
| Water heater is > 10 years old during renovation | Advisory | Proactive replacement recommended to avoid reactive emergency replacement post-renovation |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.6 Victorian Gas Ban Implications

**Confidence:** HIGH (government legislation)

| Effective Date | Requirement | Impact on Renovations |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 January 2024 | No new gas connections for new dwellings requiring planning permits | Does NOT affect renovations of existing homes with existing gas connections |
| 1 January 2025 | Extended to all new residential buildings and subdivisions | Does NOT affect renovations of existing homes |
| 1 January 2027 | All new residential buildings must be all-electric | Does NOT affect renovations of existing homes, but signals direction |
| Future (proposed) | End-of-life replacement of gas appliances to be electric | NOT YET LEGISLATED. Regulatory Impact Statement published December 2024 proposed requiring electric replacement at end-of-life, but not yet enacted |
| Current | LPG (bottled gas) is unaffected by the gas ban | Applies to natural gas (reticulated) connections only |

**Scope impact for Victorian renovations:**
- Renovations of existing homes with existing gas connections can still install new gas hot water systems (as of February 2026)
- However, recommend discussing electrification with the homeowner given the regulatory direction
- If the homeowner is considering future-proofing, a heat pump is the recommended replacement
- Rebates strongly incentivise the switch to heat pump

## 5. Tempering Valve Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS/NZS 3500.4:2025, AS/NZS 4032 series)

### 5.1 AS/NZS 3500.4 Temperature Requirements

The standard mandates a dual-temperature approach to prevent both Legionella growth (requires storage at >=60C) and scalding (requires delivery at <=50C or <=45C).

| Requirement | Temperature | Standard Reference |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Storage temperature** (to prevent Legionella) | >= 60C | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |
| **Delivery temperature to personal hygiene outlets** (general residential) | <= 50C | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |
| **Delivery temperature to personal hygiene outlets** (healthcare, aged care, childcare, schools, disability facilities) | <= 45C | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |
| **Kitchen sink** | No tempering required (can be full temperature up to 60C+) | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |
| **Laundry taps** | No tempering required (can be full temperature) | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |
| **Outdoor taps** | No tempering required | AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |

**Key principle:** Water must be stored HOT (>=60C) to kill Legionella bacteria, but delivered COOLER (<=50C) to prevent scalding at personal hygiene outlets. This is achieved using temperature control devices (tempering valves or TMVs).

### 5.2 Tempering Valve vs TMV

| Feature | Tempering Valve (TV) | Thermostatic Mixing Valve (TMV) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Standard** | AS/NZS 4032.1 | AS/NZS 4032.2 |
| **Maximum delivery temperature** | 50C | 45C |
| **Failsafe mechanism** | Thermal shutoff if cold water fails (shuts off hot) | Full thermal shutoff + cold water failsafe. More precise temperature control |
| **Use in residential** | Standard residential bathrooms | Required only for healthcare, aged care, childcare, schools, disability |
| **Accuracy** | +/- 3C | +/- 2C |
| **Cost (supply only)** | $80 - $150 | $200 - $400 |
| **Servicing** | Annual testing. Replacement every 5 years (AS 4032.3) | Annual testing. More frequent maintenance due to precision requirements |
| **Typical installation location** | At HW outlet from tank (single valve for whole house), or at fixture group (e.g., one per bathroom) | At each individual outlet or fixture group requiring 45C delivery |
| **Residential default** | **This is what is needed for standard residential renovations** | Not required for standard residential (only aged care/childcare/healthcare) |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.3 Which Outlets Need Tempering?

| Outlet Type | Tempering Required? | Maximum Delivery Temperature | Device Required |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| **Shower** | Yes | 50C | Tempering valve |
| **Bath** | Yes | 50C | Tempering valve |
| **Bathroom basin** | Yes | 50C | Tempering valve |
| **Bidet** | Yes | 50C | Tempering valve |
| **Kitchen sink** | No | Untempered (up to heater set temp) | None -- scald risk accepted as kitchen requires higher temp for hygiene |
| **Laundry tub** | No | Untempered | None |
| **Laundry washing machine** | No | Untempered | None |
| **Dishwasher** | No | Untempered (or machine has internal heater) | None |
| **Outdoor tap** | No | Untempered | None |
| **Spa/hydrotherapy** | Yes | 50C (residential), 45C (commercial) | Tempering valve or TMV |

**AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 update:** Thermostatically controlled taps are now an acceptable option for limiting delivery temperature to 45C or 50C at individual fixtures, as an alternative to a centralised tempering valve.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.4 Installation Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Minimum temperature differential** | 10C between incoming hot water and set delivery temperature. If delivery is set at 50C, incoming hot water must be at least 60C |
| **Cold water supply** | Must have adequate cold water pressure and flow. Cold water inlet must be on same supply as fixture |
| **Strainer** | Inline strainer recommended upstream of valve to prevent debris |
| **Check valves** | Required on hot and cold inlets to prevent cross-flow |
| **Isolation valves** | Required on hot and cold inlets for maintenance access |
| **Test point** | Downstream test point required for commissioning and annual testing |
| **Accessible location** | Must be installed in an accessible location for testing and maintenance. NOT concealed in walls or ceilings |
| **Maximum distance from outlet** | AS/NZS 3500.4 specifies maximum pipe length between tempering valve and fixture to prevent temperature rise in dead legs |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.5 Servicing Schedule

| Service | Frequency | Standard | Who Can Perform |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Field testing (output temperature check)** | Every 12 months (maximum interval) | AS 4032.3:2022 | Licensed plumber |
| **Visual inspection** | Every 12 months | AS 4032.3:2022 | Licensed plumber |
| **Valve replacement (tempering valve)** | Every 5 years (maximum interval) | AS 4032.3:2022 | Licensed plumber |
| **TMV replacement** | Every 5 years or per manufacturer (may be serviceable with cartridge replacement) | AS 4032.3:2022 | Licensed plumber |
| **Record keeping** | Results of field tests must be recorded | AS 4032.3:2022 | Licensed plumber |

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Scope impact:** The scope should note that tempering valves require ongoing annual testing and 5-year replacement. This is a maintenance item the homeowner should be made aware of.

### 5.6 Scope Implications for Tempering

| Scenario | Tempering Scope Item |
|----------|---------------------|
| **New hot water system installation** | Supply and install tempering valve(s). Commission and test. Provide compliance certificate |
| **Hot water system replacement (like-for-like)** | Inspect and test existing tempering valve. Replace if > 5 years old or if it fails testing. Note: some older installations may not have a tempering valve -- one must be installed under current standard |
| **Adding a new bathroom** | Additional tempering valve or verify existing centralised valve covers new outlet. If valve is at tank, existing valve may suffice. If valve is per-bathroom, new valve required |
| **Renovating existing bathroom** | Inspect and test existing tempering valve. Replace if due. Ensure compliance with current AS/NZS 3500.4:2025 |
| **No hot water work but bathroom renovation** | If touching hot water pipework at all (even reconnecting after tiling), tempering compliance must be verified |

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 6. Scope Implications -- Changeover Paths

This section details what changes in the scope when a homeowner switches from one hot water type to another during a renovation. Each changeover path lists the specific additional work items required.

### 6.1 Electric Storage to Heat Pump

**Confidence:** HIGH

This is the most common changeover in 2025-2026 due to rebate incentives and electrification trends.

| Scope Item | Required? | Detail | Estimated Additional Cost |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Remove existing electric storage unit** | Yes | Disconnect electrical. Drain tank. Remove and dispose of old unit responsibly | $150 - $300 |
| **Concrete pad / paver base** | Usually | Heat pump units are heavier and taller than electric storage. May need a new or larger concrete pad (minimum 50mm thick, level) | $200 - $400 |
| **New electrical circuit** | Sometimes | If existing circuit is 20A/4mm2 for a 3.6kW element, it MAY be adequate for a heat pump with 2.4kW backup element on a 15A plug. If heat pump is plug-in (15A), may use existing GPO or existing HW circuit with modification. If existing circuit is on controlled load and heat pump needs to run during the day, the circuit must be changed to continuous supply | $200 - $500 (circuit modification), $400 - $800 (new circuit) |
| **Controlled load tariff change** | Often | Many electric storage HWS are on off-peak controlled load. Heat pumps can be on controlled load BUT many benefit from running during warmer daytime hours for higher COP. Discuss with homeowner. May need tariff change request to DNSP | $0 - $150 (DNSP fee) |
| **Condensate drain** | Yes | Heat pumps produce condensate (cold moist air output). Must be drained to a suitable location -- garden, stormwater drain, or plumbed to sewer gully. Some councils require plumbed drainage rather than splash to garden | $50 - $200 |
| **Water connections** | Yes | Reconnect hot water outlet and cold water inlet. May need to relocate if new unit is different height/configuration. PTR valve and drain must be connected | $100 - $300 |
| **Tempering valve** | Check | Inspect existing tempering valve. Replace if > 5 years old. If none exists (older installation), install new tempering valve | $0 (existing OK) - $250 (new valve) |
| **Clearance assessment** | Yes | Heat pump requires more air space than electric storage. Verify minimum clearances for air intake/discharge. May require relocating the unit if existing location is enclosed | $0 (adequate) - $500+ (relocation) |
| **Noise assessment** | Advisory | Check proximity to bedrooms and property boundaries. Note any concerns for homeowner | $0 |
| **Rebate paperwork** | Yes | Installer creates STCs and applies state rebate discounts. Homeowner signs assignment forms | Included in installation |

**Total additional scope beyond unit cost: $700 - $2,750** (typical: $1,000 - $1,500)

**Key decision points:**
- If the existing electric storage is on a controlled load circuit, the electrician needs to determine whether to keep the heat pump on controlled load (runs overnight in cheap tariff but at lower ambient temps = lower COP) or switch to continuous/solar sponge tariff (runs during day when COP is higher but electricity may cost more). For homes with solar PV, running the heat pump during solar generation hours (10am-2pm) is ideal
- If the existing location is too enclosed for a heat pump (e.g., in a cupboard or against a wall on three sides), the unit must be relocated. This adds plumbing pipe extension and potentially new electrical run

### 6.2 Gas Storage to Gas Instantaneous

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Scope Item | Required? | Detail | Estimated Additional Cost |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Remove existing gas storage unit** | Yes | Isolate gas. Disconnect and cap gas supply. Drain tank. Remove and dispose | $200 - $400 |
| **Gas line assessment** | Yes | Gas continuous flow units have higher instantaneous gas demand than storage (e.g., 199 MJ/h for 26L unit vs ~27 MJ/h for 135L storage). Existing gas pipe may be undersized. Gas meter may need upgrading for higher flow rate | $0 (adequate) - $800+ (gas line upgrade or meter change) |
| **Wall mounting** | Yes | Continuous flow units are wall-mounted. Need suitable non-combustible wall or backing. May need new bracket holes | $100 - $200 |
| **Flue changes** | Usually | Gas storage typically has a vertical open flue. Gas continuous flow has a powered flue discharging horizontally or vertically. Flue terminal clearances must be verified per AS/NZS 5601.1 | $100 - $300 |
| **Electrical connection** | Usually | Most continuous flow units require a 240V 10A GPO within 1.5m for electronic ignition and controller. Gas storage units are typically not electrically connected | $150 - $400 (new GPO) |
| **Water flow rate check** | Advisory | Continuous flow units require minimum water flow (2.5-3.0 L/min) to activate. Low-flow fixtures may not trigger ignition. Check existing tap/shower flow rates | $0 |
| **Tempering valve** | Check | Same as any HW replacement -- inspect and replace if due | $0 - $250 |
| **Old concrete pad** | Optional | May be able to remove old concrete pad if floor space is wanted. Or repurpose | $0 - $200 (removal) |
| **Compliance certificate** | Yes | Gasfitter must issue a gas compliance certificate for the new installation | Included |

**Total additional scope beyond unit cost: $550 - $2,050** (typical: $800 - $1,200)

**Key decision points:**
- Gas line sizing is the critical assessment. A 135L gas storage unit draws ~27 MJ/h. A 26L continuous flow unit draws ~199 MJ/h -- a 7x increase in instantaneous gas demand. The existing gas pipe and meter may not support this
- If upgrading gas line, the gas fitter needs to size per AS/NZS 5601.1 from the meter to the appliance location
- Consider whether this is the right time to switch to heat pump instead (no ongoing gas costs, rebates available)

### 6.3 Gas (Any) to Heat Pump

**Confidence:** HIGH

This changeover has the most scope items because it involves decommissioning one fuel system and establishing another.

| Scope Item | Required? | Detail | Estimated Additional Cost |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Remove existing gas unit** | Yes | Isolate gas. Disconnect. Remove and dispose | $200 - $400 |
| **Gas decommissioning** | Usually | If the hot water was the last gas appliance, the gas supply to the property may be decommissioned. If other gas appliances remain (cooktop, heater), only the HW gas run needs to be capped. Decommissioning requires: cap gas pipe at manifold, remove redundant pipework (optional but recommended), issue gas compliance certificate | $150 - $500 (cap and certify), $500 - $1,500 (full line removal) |
| **New electrical circuit** | Usually | Most gas HW locations do not have a suitable electrical circuit for a heat pump. A new dedicated 15A or 20A circuit must be run from the switchboard to the HW location | $400 - $1,000 |
| **Concrete pad** | Usually | New pad required if gas unit was on a different base or different location | $200 - $400 |
| **Water pipe modifications** | Often | Gas unit and heat pump may have different connection heights, diameters, or orientations. Hot and cold water pipes may need extending, relocating, or adapting | $150 - $400 |
| **Condensate drain** | Yes | New requirement -- gas units don't produce condensate | $50 - $200 |
| **Location change** | Often | Gas unit location may not be suitable for heat pump (insufficient air clearance, too close to bedroom, enclosed area). Heat pump may need to go in a completely different location, requiring extended pipe runs | $0 (same location) - $1,500+ (new location with extended plumbing and electrical) |
| **Tempering valve** | Check | Inspect and replace if due | $0 - $250 |
| **Rebate paperwork** | Yes | STCs + state rebate | Included |
| **Two compliance certificates** | Yes | One for gas decommissioning (gasfitter). One for plumbing work (plumber, who may also be the gasfitter). Separate electrical certificate if electrician does circuit work | Included in respective trades |

**Total additional scope beyond unit cost: $1,150 - $4,650** (typical: $1,500 - $2,500)

**Key decision points:**
- Is the gas supply being decommissioned entirely (last gas appliance)? If so, the homeowner should notify the gas retailer and may benefit from removing the gas meter rental charge from their bill
- Location change is the biggest variable cost. If the gas unit was in a tight outdoor alcove on one side of the house, and the heat pump needs to go on the opposite side near the garage, the plumbing and electrical runs add significant cost
- Always confirm that the new location meets noise and clearance requirements before committing

### 6.4 Any Type to Solar

**Confidence:** HIGH

Solar hot water has the most complex installation scope of any changeover path.

| Scope Item | Required? | Detail | Estimated Additional Cost |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Remove existing unit** | Yes | As per applicable removal type above | $150 - $500 |
| **Roof assessment** | Yes (if close-coupled) | Structural assessment for close-coupled systems (300-420 kg). Split systems only need roof assessment for collector mounting | $0 (split) - $300 (structural assessment for close-coupled) |
| **Roof reinforcement** | Sometimes (close-coupled only) | If roof rafters cannot support the weight, bracing or additional support required | $0 (split or adequate roof) - $1,500 (rafter bracing) |
| **Collector mounting** | Yes | Mount 2-4 collectors on roof. Includes mounting brackets (tile, metal, or flat roof specific), roof penetration flashings, and waterproofing | $500 - $1,200 |
| **Circulation pump and controller** | Yes (split system only) | Solar differential temperature controller + circulation pump to move fluid between roof collectors and ground tank | $300 - $600 |
| **Pipe runs (roof to tank)** | Yes (split system) | Insulated copper flow and return pipes from roof collectors to ground-level tank. Must be UV-protected where exposed | $400 - $1,000 (depending on distance and complexity) |
| **Roof penetrations** | Yes | Flow and return pipes must penetrate the roof. Proper flashings and waterproofing essential | $200 - $400 |
| **Glycol filling** | Sometimes | In frost-prone areas, the collector circuit uses glycol (antifreeze) solution. Requires filling, bleeding, and pressure testing | $100 - $200 |
| **Booster connection** | Yes | Electric: dedicated circuit to in-tank element. Gas: gas supply and continuous flow unit in series | $200 - $800 (depending on booster type and existing infrastructure) |
| **Tank and connections** | Yes | New solar-compatible tank at ground level (split) or on roof (close-coupled). Hot/cold water connections. PTR valve and drain | $300 - $600 |
| **Tempering valve** | Yes | New installation requires tempering valve | $150 - $250 |
| **Rebate paperwork** | Yes | STCs (typically more STCs than heat pump due to solar contribution) + state rebate | Included |
| **Electrical work** | Yes | Power for circulation pump controller (split), booster element circuit, RCD protection | $300 - $700 |

**Total additional scope beyond unit cost: $2,600 - $7,250** (typical: $3,500 - $5,000)

**Key decision points:**
- Close-coupled vs split system: close-coupled is simpler (no pump/controller/pipe runs) but requires strong roof and has high visual impact. Split is more common in renovations
- Flat plate vs evacuated tube collectors: evacuated tubes are better in cooler climates but more expensive and fragile
- For most renovations in 2025-2026, a heat pump is a simpler and more cost-effective choice than solar thermal, especially when combined with solar PV

### 6.5 Like-for-Like Replacement

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Scope Item | Required? | Detail | Estimated Additional Cost |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Remove and dispose of old unit** | Yes | Disconnect, drain, remove | $150 - $300 |
| **Install new unit of same type and size** | Yes | Connect water, gas (if applicable), electrical (if applicable) | Included in installed price |
| **Tempering valve check** | Yes | Must comply with current AS/NZS 3500.4:2025. If no tempering valve exists (pre-2005 installations), one must now be installed. If existing valve is > 5 years old, replace | $0 - $250 |
| **PTR valve** | Yes | New unit comes with new PTR valve. Drain line must be connected per current standard | Included |
| **Compliance certificate** | Yes | Plumber (and gasfitter if gas) issues compliance certificate | Included |

**Like-for-like is the simplest changeover but misses the opportunity for efficiency improvement and rebates.**

### 6.6 Electric Storage to Electric Storage (Tariff Considerations)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

| Scenario | What Changes | Scope Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Same tariff (off-peak to off-peak)** | Nothing changes electrically beyond reconnection | Minimal -- standard replacement |
| **Off-peak to continuous** | Meter configuration change. Load control relay removal or bypass | Electrician to reconfigure. DNSP notification. May increase running costs but provides 24/7 heating |
| **Continuous to off-peak** | Meter configuration change. Load control relay or ripple receiver installation | Electrician to install relay. DNSP to enable controlled load. Reduces running costs but hot water may run out in late afternoon |
| **Adding solar PV diversion** | Timer or solar divert device to run HWS element during solar generation | Electrician to install timer/diverter on HW circuit. Does not change tariff but supplements with solar |

### 7.3 Sizing Guide

Use this to determine what size hot water system the renovation requires.

#### 7.3.1 Electric Storage Sizing

| Household Size | Off-Peak (CL1) | Off-Peak + Day Boost (CL2) | Continuous | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------|
| 1-2 people | 125-160L | 80-125L | 80-125L | Single bathroom |
| 2-3 people | 160-250L | 125-160L | 125-160L | |
| 3-5 people | 250-315L | 160-250L | 160-250L | **Most common size for 3-bed home** |
| 5-7 people | 315-400L | 250-315L | 250-315L | |
| 7+ people | 400L+ or twin system | 315-400L | 315-400L | Consider continuous flow instead |

**Off-peak sizing note:** Off-peak tanks need to be larger because the water only heats overnight and must last all day. CL2 allows a daytime boost so can be slightly smaller.

#### 7.3.2 Gas Continuous Flow Sizing

| Household / Bathrooms | Recommended Unit Size | Simultaneous Use Capacity | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| 1 bathroom, 1-2 people | 16L or 20L | 1 shower | |
| 1-2 bathrooms, 2-4 people | 26L | 2 showers simultaneously | **Most popular residential** |
| 2-3 bathrooms, 4-6 people | 26L or 32L | 2-3 showers simultaneously | 32L for colder climates |
| 3+ bathrooms, 6+ people | 32L or 2 x 26L manifolded | 3+ showers simultaneously | Manifold for very large homes |

#### 7.3.3 Heat Pump Sizing

| Household Size | Recommended Tank Size | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1-2 people | 150-220L | Stiebel Eltron WWK 222H |
| 2-4 people | 250-270L | iStore 270L, Rinnai Hotflo Plus 250L, Rheem Ambiheat 270L |
| 4-6 people | 270-315L | Sanden 315L, Stiebel Eltron WWK 302, Reclaim 315L |
| 6+ people | 315L+ or twin system | Consider split system with large tank |

**Heat pump sizing note:** Heat pumps recover more slowly than electric elements (2-4 hours for a full tank reheat in heat pump mode vs 1-2 hours for a 3.6kW element). However, they heat more efficiently. For large households, ensure the tank size provides adequate first-hour delivery. Some heat pumps can run the backup electric element in parallel with the heat pump for faster recovery during peak demand.

#### 7.3.4 Solar Hot Water Sizing

| Household Size | Tank Size | Collector Area | Booster Size | Notes |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| 1-2 people | 180-250L | 2-3 m2 (1-2 collectors) | 1.8 kW element or 16L CF gas | |
| 2-4 people | 250-315L | 3-4 m2 (2 collectors) | 2.4-3.6 kW element or 20-26L CF gas | **Most common** |
| 4-6 people | 315-400L | 4-6 m2 (2-3 collectors) | 3.6 kW element or 26L CF gas | |
| 6+ people | 400L+ or twin | 6-8 m2 (3-4 collectors) | 3.6-4.8 kW or 26L+ CF gas | Large roof area needed |
