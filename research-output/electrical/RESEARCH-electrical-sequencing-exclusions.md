## SECTION 5: SEQUENCING & COORDINATION

### 5.1 First Fix (Rough-In)

#### What Exactly Happens During Electrical Rough-In

Rough-in is the installation of all electrical infrastructure that will be concealed inside walls, ceilings, and floors before they are closed up with plasterboard/gyprock. Specifically:

- **Running cables**: Electrical cables are run through wall frames, ceiling joists, and under floors from the switchboard to every planned power point, light switch, light fitting location, and appliance connection point.
- **Mounting back boxes**: Electrical boxes (mounting plates) for outlets, switches, and light fixtures are installed and secured to the framing at correct heights (typically GPOs at 300mm above finished floor, switches at 1000-1200mm).
- **Running circuits from switchboard**: Dedicated circuits are run from the switchboard to high-demand appliances (oven, cooktop, hot water, air conditioning). General power and lighting circuits are distributed across multiple circuits per AS/NZS 3000.
- **Conduit installation**: Protective conduit (tubing) is used to protect cables in exposed areas, through concrete slabs, or where required by regulations.
- **Earthing**: Earth connections are established and bonded as required.
- **Cable labelling**: Circuits are labelled at the switchboard end for identification.

Cables run outside of wall cavities must be appropriately shielded per the Australian/New Zealand Wiring Rules (AS/NZS 3000:2018).

#### When in the Build Sequence Does Rough-In Happen

Electrical rough-in occurs:
1. **AFTER** framing/structural work is complete (wall frames erected, ceiling joists in place)
2. **AFTER** or **CONCURRENT WITH** plumbing rough-in (plumbing typically goes first or at the same time)
3. **BEFORE** insulation is installed
4. **BEFORE** plasterboard/gyprock is fixed to frames
5. **BEFORE** external cladding in some cases

The typical renovation sequence is:
> Demolition --> Plumbing/Electrical Rough-In --> Wall Fixing --> Waterproofing --> Tiling --> Joinery --> Final Fit-Off --> Painting --> Cleaning

#### Trades That Must Finish BEFORE Electrical Rough-In

1. **Framing / Carpentry**: Wall frames, ceiling joists, and structural elements must be in place so cables can be run through them.
2. **Plumbing rough-in (partially)**: Plumbing almost always comes before or concurrent with electrical rough-in. Pipes are larger, more rigid, and require precise positioning. Electrical wiring offers more flexibility to route around pipes. If electrical goes in first, plumbing installations may conflict with newly installed cables, causing costly rework.
3. **Demolition**: All demolition must be complete, old fixtures removed, and the space cleared.
4. **Any structural modifications**: Beam installations, wall removals, new openings must be done before wiring runs through frames.

#### What Must Happen BEFORE Walls Are Closed Up

1. **Rough-in inspection**: Once all rough-ins (plumbing, electrical, gas, HVAC, security, network cabling) are installed but before gyprock is fitted, a thorough inspection is essential. Inspectors verify:
   - Power outlet and switch placement at correct heights
   - Proper wiring security and labelling
   - External conduit installation
   - Meter box installation with RCD testing
   - Circuit labelling completion

2. **Photographic documentation**: Contractors should thoroughly document all concealed elements through photographs and videos. Photos can quickly prove work was completed safely without removing wall sections later, which would create delays and additional costs. Photos should reference inspection numbers for efficient tracking.

3. **Testing**: Basic circuit continuity and insulation testing before close-up.

4. **Coordination sign-off**: Confirmation from all trades that their rough-in is complete and no further access to wall cavities is needed.

**Critical principle**: "Fixing issues before walls go up is easier, faster, and cheaper" than post-installation corrections.

#### Typical Duration for Electrical Rough-In

| Renovation Type | Rough-In Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bathroom renovation | 1-2 days | Shorter if keeping same layout |
| Kitchen renovation | 2-3 days | Longer due to multiple dedicated circuits for appliances |
| Combined kitchen + bathroom | 3-5 days | Depends on complexity and layout changes |
| Whole-home rewire (2-3 bed) | 3-5 days | Open wall access speeds this up |
| Whole-home rewire (4+ bed, double storey) | 7-14 days | Larger homes with complex circuits |
| New build (average home) | 3-10 days | About 1 week is typical |

When combined with plumbing rough-in, the total rough-in phase typically takes 1-2 weeks.

#### What the Electrician Needs from the Homeowner/Builder BEFORE Rough-In

The electrician requires the following decisions and information to be confirmed before they can start rough-in:

1. **Light positions confirmed**: Exact locations of all ceiling lights, wall lights, downlights, pendant drops, and feature lighting. If downlights will replace bayonet fittings later, the standard location should be moved to the future downlight position now.

2. **GPO (power point) positions**: Locations of all general power outlets, including heights and whether on internal or external walls. Important: GPOs on internal walls are very difficult to add later (require cutting through plaster and patching). External wall GPOs are easier to add post-build.

3. **Switch locations**: Where light switches go, what they control, whether any multi-way switching (e.g., two switches controlling one light from different locations).

4. **Appliance selections**: The electrician must know:
   - Oven type and size (single/double, electric/gas)
   - Cooktop type (induction requires heavy dedicated circuit, gas needs ignition power only)
   - Rangehood type and location
   - Dishwasher position
   - Microwave position (built-in shelf, overhead cupboard, or benchtop)
   - Hot water system type (if changing from gas to electric)
   - Each high-demand appliance needs its own dedicated circuit

5. **Cabinetry drawings**: GPO positions must match cabinetry drawings exactly. Under-cabinet lighting rough-in position depends on cabinet height and configuration.

6. **Island bench electrical**: If power is needed on a kitchen island, conduit must be run through the concrete slab before it is poured, or through the floor cavity. This cannot be added easily later.

7. **Exhaust fan locations**: Bathroom, laundry, kitchen exhaust positions.

8. **Special items**: Heated towel rails, in-floor heating mats, spa pump circuits, EV charger preparation, home theatre wiring.

### 5.2 Second Fix (Fit-Off)

#### When Does Second Fix Happen

Second fix electrical work begins after:
1. Plasterboard/gyprock is fixed and set (joints filled and sanded)
2. Painting is complete (at least first and second coat; some builders do final coat after second fix)
3. Tiling is complete (bathroom/kitchen wall and floor tiles)
4. Cabinetry is installed (kitchen cabinets, vanities)
5. Benchtops are installed (splashback area may or may not be done)

The typical approach in Australian renovations:
> Plastering --> Painting (2 coats) --> Tiling --> Cabinetry --> Benchtops --> Splashbacks --> Second Fix Electrical & Plumbing --> Final Paint Touch-Up

Some builders prefer to do second fix before the final paint coat so painters can touch up around switch plates and GPO covers.

**Source:** [Retreat Design - Kitchen Renovation Timeline](https://www.retreatdesignperth.com.au/blog/timeline-of-a-kitchen-renovation)

#### What Is Involved in Second Fix

- Installing switch plates (face plates) on light switches
- Installing GPO (power point) cover plates
- Installing and connecting light fittings (downlights, pendants, feature lights)
- Connecting and testing ceiling fans
- Connecting rangehood, oven, cooktop, dishwasher
- Installing and connecting exhaust fans
- Installing heated towel rail connections
- Connecting the switchboard (final circuit connections)
- Installing and testing smoke alarms (hard-wired interconnected)
- Connecting any smart home devices or dimmer switches
- Final testing of all circuits

**Source:** [BEAM - First and Second Fix When Building](https://beamcentralsystems.com/blog/what-happens-at-first-fix-and-second-fix-when-building-a-home)

#### What Needs to Be Done by Other Trades First

| Trade | What Must Be Complete Before Second Fix |
|---|---|
| Plasterer | All plasterboard fixed, joints set and sanded, cornices installed |
| Painter | At least primer + 2 coats on walls and ceilings |
| Tiler | All wall and floor tiles laid, grouted, and sealed |
| Cabinet maker | All cabinetry installed and secured to walls |
| Benchtop installer | Benchtops templated and installed |
| Splashback installer | Glass or tile splashback installed (for under-cabinet lighting and splashback GPOs) |

#### Typical Duration for Second Fix

| Renovation Type | Second Fix Duration |
|---|---|
| Bathroom | 0.5-1 day |
| Kitchen | 1-2 days |
| Whole-home (3 bedroom) | 2.5-5 days |
| New build | 3-5 days |

Duration depends on the number of circuits, fixtures, and complexity of connections.

### 5.3 Final Fix / Commissioning

#### What Is Included in Final Fix

Final fix and commissioning is the completion stage where the electrical installation is verified, tested, and certified:

1. **Final connections**: Any remaining appliance connections, final wiring terminations
2. **Comprehensive testing** (per AS/NZS 3000:2018):
   - **Insulation resistance testing**: Tests cable insulation integrity (caution: 500V DC test voltage can damage RCDs, so they must be isolated during this test)
   - **Polarity testing**: Confirms correct active, neutral, and earth connections at every point
   - **RCD trip time testing**: Verifies safety switches operate within required timeframes:
     - Type I (10mA): Maximum 40ms tripping time
     - Type II (30mA): Maximum 300ms tripping time
   - **Earth fault loop impedance (EFLI)**: Verifies the fault path is adequate to trip protective devices
   - **Circuit continuity**: Confirms all protective earth conductors are continuous
   - **Correct circuit connections**: Verifies each circuit breaker protects the correct outlets

3. **Switchboard labelling**: All circuit breakers labelled clearly identifying what each circuit supplies (e.g., "Kitchen GPOs", "Master Bedroom Lights", "Oven")

4. **Smoke alarm testing**: Verification that interconnected smoke alarms all trigger when one is activated

5. **Certification**: Issuance of the Certificate of Electrical Safety / Certificate of Compliance

**Sources:**
- [ACA - Testing Electrical Installations](https://www.constructors.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ACA-Testing-electrical-installations-Final-2014.pdf)
- [EWRB - What Tests Are Required](https://www.ewrb.govt.nz/tools-and-resources/toolbox/what-tests-are-required/)

#### Certificate of Compliance / Certificate of Electrical Safety

A Certificate of Electrical Safety (COES) is a legal document provided by a registered electrical contractor or licensed electrician proving the work complies with AS/NZS 3000. It is required for ALL electrical installation work including new installations, alterations, repairs, and maintenance.

**State-specific requirements:**

| State/Territory | Document Name | Timeframe to Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Victoria | Certificate of Electrical Safety (COES) | 16 calendar days (prescribed work) | Prescribed work requires inspection by Licensed Electrical Inspector |
| NSW | Certificate of Compliance for Electrical Work (CCEW) | 7 days | Must be given to customer |
| Queensland | Electrical Safety Certificate | 28 days | Required for all work except minor repair/maintenance |
| South Australia | Certificate of Compliance | 30 days | |
| Western Australia | Electrical Safety Certificate | 28 days | |
| Tasmania, ACT, NT | Similar certificates | Varies | Follow similar procedures |

In Victoria, there are two types:
- **Prescribed certificates**: For work that requires inspection by a Licensed Electrical Inspector (e.g., new circuits, switchboard work, mains connections)
- **Non-prescribed certificates**: For simpler work (e.g., replacing a light fitting, adding a GPO to an existing circuit)

A prescribed COES must be issued BEFORE the work is connected to the electricity supply.

### 5.4 Coordination with Other Trades

#### 1. Electrician + Plumber

**Shared service routes**: Pipes and cables often share wall cavities, floor spaces, and ceiling cavities. Coordination is essential to avoid conflicts.

**Who goes first**: Plumbing rough-in almost always comes first or runs concurrently. Pipes are larger, rigid, and require precise positioning. Electrical cables are flexible and can route around pipes. If electrical goes first, plumbing may conflict with cables, causing costly rework.

**Hot water changeover (gas to electric)**: If converting from gas to electric hot water, the electrician needs to run a dedicated circuit to the hot water location. A heat pump hot water system typically needs a dedicated 20A circuit. Coordination with the plumber is critical as the unit location may change.

**Bathroom rough-in coordination**: Both trades work in the same confined space. Best practice is to involve both trades during the design and quoting stage rather than waiting until work begins. When trades have worked together before, they understand each other's space requirements.

**Key rule**: Electricians and plumbers should have their own separate days on site. Having power or water turned off makes it very difficult for other trades to work.

**Source:** [BetaFlow - Plumbing or Electrical First](https://betaflow.com.au/what-comes-first-in-a-bathroom-renovation-plumbing-or-electrical/)

#### 2. Electrician + Carpenter/Plasterer

**When walls need to be open**: Walls must remain open (unlined) until ALL rough-in trades have completed their work and any required inspections have passed. The carpenter/plasterer cannot close up walls until electrical, plumbing, gas, HVAC, and data rough-ins are all complete and signed off.

**Communication about cable routes**: The electrician should mark cable routes on frames or take photos so the plasterer knows where cables run (to avoid driving screws into cables when fixing plasterboard).

**Backing for heavy items**: If heavy items will be wall-mounted over power points (e.g., TV mount over a power point), the carpenter needs to install timber backing (nogging) between studs before the wall is closed. The electrician needs to communicate these positions.

**When they can close up**: Only after:
- All rough-in inspections pass
- All trades confirm no further access needed
- Documentation photos are taken

**Source:** [Constructor.net.au - C10 Rough-In Checklist](https://www.constructor.net.au/c10-the-rough-in-stage-inspection-checklist/)

#### 3. Electrician + Tiler

**Items that MUST go in BEFORE tiling:**
- **In-floor heating mats/cables**: Must be installed and tested (resistance readings with multimeter) before any tiles are laid. The heating cable is tested three times: out of the box, after laying, and after tiling. Damage found after tiling means ripping up the floor.
- **Shower niche lighting**: Any recessed lighting in shower niches must be roughed in before tiling.
- **Recessed bathroom items**: Any items embedded in tiled walls (e.g., recessed toilet roll holders with lighting).
- **Waterproofing certification**: Electrical penetrations through waterproofed areas must be sealed and certified before tiling.

**Items that go in AFTER tiling:**
- Switch plates and GPO cover plates
- Light fittings
- Exhaust fan grilles
- Heated towel rail connections

- [Custom Heat - How to Test Underfloor Heating](https://www.customheat.com.au/how-to-test-underfloor-heating/)

#### 4. Electrician + Painter

**Recommended approach (most common in Australia):**
1. Painting happens FIRST (at least primer + 2 coats)
2. Electrician does second fix (installs switch plates, GPO covers, light fittings)
3. Painter returns for final touch-up coat around plates and fittings

**Why paint first is preferred:**
- Painters don't have to remove switch plates and outlet covers
- Painters don't have to tape off or wrap light fixtures in plastic
- Painters don't have to cut in around outlets and switch boxes
- Less risk of paint on new switch plates and fittings

**Important Australian note**: Under Australian electrical law, only licensed electricians should handle switch plate installation and removal. Painters should not be removing or refitting electrical cover plates.

#### 5. Electrician + Cabinet Maker / Kitchen Installer

**Critical coordination points:**

- **Under-cabinet lighting**: Rough-in wiring must come through the wall at the correct height (typically just above the bottom of upper cabinets, around 1" above the bottom shelf rail). This must be confirmed against cabinetry shop drawings before rough-in.

- **GPO positions MUST match cabinetry drawings**: Power points behind bench-height appliance cupboards, inside pantries, or behind rangehoods must align exactly with cabinet openings. Even 50mm out can mean a GPO is blocked by a cabinet panel.

- **Splashback coordination**: Under-cabinet lighting rough-in must happen before the splashback is installed (whether glass or tile). The wiring drops behind the splashback from above the upper cabinets.

- **Appliance positions confirmed before rough-in**: Oven, cooktop, dishwasher, and microwave positions must be locked in before electrical rough-in. Moving an appliance after cables are run means re-doing wiring work.

- **Island bench power**: If power is needed on a kitchen island, it must be run through the slab or floor before the slab is poured or the floor is closed. This is extremely difficult to retrofit.

#### 6. Electrician + Air Conditioning Installer

**Division of responsibilities:**

| Responsibility | Who Does It |
|---|---|
| Dedicated circuit from switchboard to AC location | Electrician |
| Cable sizing per manufacturer specs and AS/NZS 3000 | Electrician |
| Lockable isolating switch adjacent to outdoor unit | Electrician |
| Circuit breaker in switchboard for AC circuit | Electrician |
| Refrigerant piping and connections | AC installer (must hold ARCtick licence) |
| Mounting indoor and outdoor units | AC installer |
| Interconnecting control wiring between indoor/outdoor units | Varies - often AC installer, but must comply with AS/NZS 3000 |
| Commissioning and gas charge | AC installer |

**Key regulatory requirements (AS/NZS 3000:2018, Clause 4.19):**
- Every air conditioning system with a compressor must have a lockable isolating switch adjacent to the outdoor unit
- The isolator must NOT be mounted on the unit itself
- The isolator must be accessible
- Units 5kW and above require a dedicated electrical circuit
- Units 2-4.6kW may share an existing circuit depending on manufacturer requirements and load calculation
- All installations must comply with manufacturer instructions (Clause 1.7.1)

#### 7. Electrician + Demolition

**Before demolition begins:**
1. **Isolation of existing circuits**: The electrician must identify and isolate all circuits in the area to be demolished. This includes circuits passing through the demolition zone to other parts of the house.
2. **Disconnection of services**: The electrician disconnects and makes safe all electrical connections in the demolition area (removal of light fittings, GPOs, switches).
3. **Identification of circuits serving other areas**: Some circuits may pass through the demolition zone to supply power to rooms that aren't being renovated. These need to be rerouted or temporarily disconnected.
4. **Asbestos check**: If the home was built before 1990, switchboard panels may contain asbestos (Zelemite and Millboard panels contained up to 20% asbestos). A specialist asbestos contractor must be engaged before disturbing these.

**Temporary power provisions during renovation:**
- If the renovation involves disconnecting the main power supply, a temporary construction supply may be needed
- Temporary power requires a construction switchboard complying with AS/NZS 3012
- A Level 2 ASP (Authorised Service Provider) is required for disconnection/reconnection of mains supply
- Construction wiring must be inspected by a licensed electrical worker before energisation and re-inspected every 6 months

### 5.5 Critical Hold Points

#### Mandatory Stop Points

These are moments where work MUST stop until electrical work is completed and verified:

1. **Cannot close walls until rough-in is inspected**: Once plasterboard goes up, accessing cables is destructive and expensive. All electrical rough-in must be complete, inspected, and photographed before walls are closed.

2. **Cannot tile floor until in-floor heating is tested**: The heating cable must be tested with a multimeter (resistance readings within +/- 5% of manufacturer specifications) and documented. If a cable is damaged under tiles, the entire floor must be ripped up.

3. **Cannot pour concrete slab until under-slab conduits are in place**: Any electrical conduits running through or under a concrete slab (e.g., for island bench power, floor outlets) must be installed before the pour.

4. **Cannot install splashback until under-cabinet lighting and splashback GPOs are roughed in**: Wiring behind glass or tile splashbacks is impossible to access after installation.

5. **Cannot commission switchboard until all circuits are complete**: The switchboard cannot be fully connected and tested until all first and second fix work is done.

6. **Cannot occupy/use until Certificate of Electrical Safety is issued**: For prescribed work, the certificate must be issued before the work is connected to supply.

#### Costly Mistakes if Sequencing Goes Wrong

1. **Closing walls before rough-in is complete**: Requires cutting open plasterboard, re-wiring, patching, repainting. Can add $1,000-$5,000+ depending on extent.

2. **Tiling over untested in-floor heating**: A damaged cable found after tiling means removing all tiles, adhesive, and possibly waterproofing membrane. Cost can be $3,000-$10,000+.

3. **Installing cabinetry before confirming GPO positions**: A misaligned power point behind a kitchen cabinet can mean removing the cabinet, moving the GPO, patching the wall, and reinstalling the cabinet.

4. **Forgetting island bench power before slab pour**: Retrofitting power to a kitchen island through a concrete slab requires core drilling, which is expensive ($500-$2,000+) and may require structural engineering sign-off.

5. **Starting demolition without circuit isolation**: Risk of electrocution, damage to circuits serving other rooms, and potential fire. In 2023, Energy Safe Victoria recorded more than 300 electrical incidents linked to non-compliant renovation work.

6. **Not coordinating GPO positions with cabinetry drawings**: Power points ending up behind cabinet panels, requiring costly relocation.

7. **Burying junction boxes behind plasterboard**: During renovations, junction boxes can be accidentally covered by insulation or panelling, creating access problems for future inspections and a compliance issue.

## SECTION 6: COMMON EXCLUSIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

### 6.1 Owner-Supplied Items (Typically Excluded from Electrical Scope)

These items are commonly supplied by the homeowner but installed by the electrician:

| Item | Typically Owner-Supplied? | Electrician's Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pendant lights / feature lights | Yes | Install only | Owner selects and purchases; electrician connects |
| Chandeliers | Yes | Install only | May require extra mounting support (nogging) |
| Ceiling fans | Often | Install only | Some electricians offer supply + install packages |
| Rangehood | Yes | Connect only | Electrician provides the power point or hardwired connection |
| Oven / cooktop | Yes | Connect only | Electrician provides the dedicated circuit and connection |
| Dishwasher | Yes | Connect only | Electrician provides the power point |
| Smart switches / smart home hubs | Yes | Install only | Compatibility must be confirmed before purchase |
| Bathroom heated towel rail | Often | Connect only | Electrician runs the circuit; owner selects the rail |
| Bathroom mirror with lighting | Often | Connect only | Must be confirmed before rough-in for wiring position |

**Source:** [WA Electrical - Price List](https://www.waelectricalandantennas.com.au/price-list/)

### 6.2 Understanding "Supply and Install" vs "Install Only" vs "Rough-In Only"

#### Supply and Install
The electrician provides BOTH the materials/fixtures AND installs them. This is a complete package where the electrician selects and purchases the items (e.g., GPOs, switches, basic light fittings, smoke alarms) and then installs them.

Example pricing (indicative):
- Ceiling fan supply + install: ~$465-$545
- Double GPO supply + install: ~$250 (on external wall)

#### Install Only
The homeowner provides the materials or fixtures; the electrician performs only the labour to install and connect them. This is cheaper because you're not paying the electrician's markup on materials, but the homeowner carries the risk of purchasing incorrect or incompatible items.

Example pricing (indicative):
- Ceiling fan install only: ~$275-$380

#### Rough-In Only
The electrician runs the cables and installs the mounting boxes but does NOT install the final fixtures. The cables are left with enough length to be pulled out later for final connection. This is common when:
- Light fittings haven't been selected yet
- Appliances haven't been purchased yet
- The homeowner wants to stage the work across different budget periods
- A different electrician or specialist will do the fit-off

**Sources:**

- [BUILD.com.au - Plumbing and Electrical Rough-In](https://build.com.au/plumbing-and-electrical-services-rough/)

### 6.3 Prime Cost (PC) Sums and Provisional Sums (PS) Explained

#### PC Sum (Prime Cost)
A prime cost item is an allowance included in a builder's quote for materials or fixtures that have not yet been selected. It covers the COST OF THE ITEM ONLY, not installation labour.

Example: "Allow PC sum of $2,000 for light fittings" means the builder has budgeted $2,000 for the homeowner to spend on selecting light fittings. If the homeowner's selections cost $3,000, they pay the $1,000 difference. If selections cost $1,500, there may or may not be a credit (check contract terms).

**Important**: Generally, there will be no refund given if your choices result in actual expense being less than the original quote unless specifically agreed otherwise with your builder.

#### Provisional Sum (PS)
A provisional sum is an estimate for work that has not yet been fully defined. It covers LABOUR AND MATERIALS for work with uncertain scope.

Example: "Provisional sum of $5,000 for electrical work" means the builder estimates the electrical work will cost around $5,000, but the final cost may be higher or lower depending on what's discovered during the renovation (e.g., existing wiring condition, asbestos, access difficulties).

**Key difference**: PC = allowance for materials the owner will select. PS = estimate for work that isn't yet fully defined.

### 6.4 Items Needing Separate Specialists

#### Data / Network Cabling
**Licensing situation in Australia**: Electricians are NOT automatically authorised to perform data/network cabling work. A separate cabler registration is required through the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).

There are three types of cabling registration:
| Registration | Scope | Experience Required |
|---|---|---|
| **Open** | All cabling work (commercial + domestic) | 360 hours within 2 years |
| **Restricted** | Domestic and small business only (simple socket/NTD) | 80 hours within 2 years |
| **Lift** | Cabling within lift environments | Specialist competency |

Many electricians do hold cabler registration as an additional qualification, but it is NOT included in their electrical licence. Always ask whether your electrician holds cabler registration before assuming they can do data work.

**Source:** [ACMA - Work as a Registered Cabler](https://www.acma.gov.au/work-registered-cabler)

#### Security System Installation
All Australian states and territories require a separate security provider/installer licence for installing security systems (CCTV, alarms, access control, intercoms). An electrician's licence alone does NOT cover security installation. Two separate registrations/licences are mandatory:
1. Security industry licence (varies by state)
2. Data cabling registration (for the cabling component)

#### Solar Panel Installation
Solar systems must be installed by an installer accredited with Solar Accreditation Australia (formerly CEC-accredited; fully transitioned from Clean Energy Council to Solar Accreditation Australia on 29 May 2024). The accredited installer must also hold an unrestricted electrical licence in the state or territory of installation. Accreditation is required to access Australian Government rebates under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES).

#### TV Antenna Installation
An electrician's licence does NOT cover antenna, telephone, or network cabling jobs. TV antenna and AV cabling registration falls under the Telecommunications Act, which is separate from electrical licensing. A specialist antenna installer with telecommunications cabling registration is required.

#### Intercom / Access Control Systems
Falls under security industry licensing (see Security Systems above). Requires both security licence and data cabling registration.

#### NBN Connection
**Division of responsibilities:**
| Task | Who Does It |
|---|---|
| Connection from street to the property boundary box | NBN Co / network provider |
| Activation and initial connection at the NTD (Network Termination Device) | NBN technician (employed by NBN Co/ISP) |
| Internal cabling from NTD to desired locations | Licensed data cabler or electrician with cabler registration |
| Additional data points around the home | Licensed data cabler or electrician with cabler registration |
| WiFi setup and router configuration | Homeowner or IT specialist |

NBN's responsibility ends at the service box located outside the house. Inside the house, it is the owner's or landlord's responsibility. If you want more than the single hard-wired connection point provided by NBN, you need a registered cabler.

### 6.5 Typically Excluded Costs

#### Council / Authority Fees Related to Electrical Work
- **Building permit fees**: Required for construction/renovation work valued at $5,000+ (varies by state). In NSW, fees for a $50,001-$250,000 project can be $459 plus $3.64 per $1,000 over $50,000.
- **Electrical inspection fees**: Some states charge for mandatory electrical inspections (e.g., Victoria charges for Licensed Electrical Inspector inspections of prescribed work).
- **Level 2 ASP fees**: Disconnection/reconnection of mains supply by an Authorised Service Provider incurs separate costs.
- **Energy distributor fees**: Fees for upgrading mains supply capacity (e.g., upgrading from single-phase to three-phase power).

These fees are almost always excluded from an electrician's quote and are the responsibility of the homeowner or builder.

#### Asbestos Removal / Testing
If asbestos is discovered during electrical work (common in pre-1990 homes), the electrician MUST stop work. Asbestos was used in:
- Switchboard panels (Zelemite and Millboard, containing up to 20% asbestos) manufactured before 1987
- Electrical backing boards
- Some conduit and cable sheathing
- Wall linings behind switchboards

A specialist asbestos contractor must be engaged. This is always excluded from the electrician's scope and quoted separately. Costs for switchboard asbestos removal range from $500-$2,000+ depending on extent.

**Source:** [Gemcell - Managing Asbestos for Electrical Contractors](https://gemcell.com.au/news/managing-asbestos-for-electrical-contractors/)

#### Structural Modifications
These are excluded from electrical scope:
- Chasing concrete walls (cutting channels for cables in solid masonry/concrete)
- Cutting through structural elements (beams, load-bearing walls)
- Core drilling through concrete slabs for conduit runs
- Fire-rating penetrations through fire-rated walls/floors

These require a builder, structural engineer sign-off, or specialist contractor.

#### Switchboard Upgrade (Typically Quoted Separately)
Switchboard upgrades are almost always quoted as a separate line item because:

1. **Scope uncertainty**: The extent of the upgrade isn't known until the existing board is assessed. Old boards may have outdated fuse wire, missing RCDs, non-compliant wiring, or asbestos panels.
2. **Hidden costs**: Cables from overhead supply to Point of Attachment (POA) and from POA to the service fuse may need replacement if they fail standards, costing $1,000-$3,000 for residential properties.
3. **Cascading faults**: Installing safety switches (RCDs) on old wiring may uncover pre-existing faults that need separate rectification.
4. **Regulatory triggers**: Current standards require all circuits to have RCD protection. A renovation may trigger mandatory switchboard upgrades to bring the board into compliance.
5. **Cost range**: $850-$7,000+ depending on amperage capacity, with 100-amp boards at the lower end and 400-amp systems at the top.

**The scope generator should flag switchboard upgrade as a potential additional cost whenever renovating homes built before 2000.**

- [KM Electric - Switchboard Upgrade Cost Guide](https://kmelectric.com.au/switchboard-upgrade-cost/)

#### Making Good (Patching and Painting)
The standard industry practice:
- **Electrician's responsibility**: Fill cable chases with bonding compound, leaving room for final plastering. The electrician should not leave holes in walls where cables were laid.
- **Plasterer's responsibility**: Final skim coat over filled chases to achieve a flush finish ready for painting.
- **Painter's responsibility**: Repainting patched areas to match existing finishes.

**Key point**: If "making good" is not explicitly included in the electrician's quote, it is excluded. This should be clearly stated in the scope of works. The electrician wires; the plasterer plasters; the painter paints.

#### Other Typically Excluded Costs
- **Builder's margin/coordination fee**: If a builder is managing the project, their margin (typically 15-25%) is separate from the electrician's quote.
- **Temporary power during renovation**: Construction power board hire and connection fees are separate.
- **Authority connection/reconnection fees**: Level 2 ASP charges for disconnecting/reconnecting mains supply are the homeowner's responsibility.
- **Meter relocations**: If the electricity meter needs to be moved, this involves the energy distributor and is a separate cost.

### 6.6 Key Assumptions Electricians Make

#### What Electricians Typically Assume Is Provided

When quoting, electricians generally assume:

1. **Clear access to work areas**: Furniture moved, rooms cleared, floor coverings protected. Limited access (e.g., tight ceiling cavity, no underfloor access) increases time and cost significantly.
2. **Power available on site**: Existing power supply is live and accessible for tools. If power is disconnected, temporary construction power is needed at additional cost.
3. **Walls open for rough-in**: During renovation rough-in, walls are assumed to be open (plasterboard removed, frames exposed). If walls need to be opened or cables chased into existing walls, this is additional work.
4. **Standard mounting heights**: Unless specified otherwise, GPOs at 300mm, switches at 1000-1200mm above finished floor level.
5. **Existing wiring is in serviceable condition**: Unless a full rewire is quoted, the electrician assumes existing wiring they're connecting to is functional and compliant.
6. **No asbestos present**: Unless identified in a pre-renovation asbestos audit.
7. **Standard cable runs**: Cables can be run through accessible routes (ceiling cavity, wall cavity, under floor). If routes are blocked or require unusual paths, additional cost applies.
8. **Single visit for each stage**: One visit for rough-in, one for second fix. Multiple return visits due to other trades not being ready are extra.

#### What Triggers a Variation (Extra Cost)

1. **Asbestos discovery**: Work must stop; specialist removal required before electrical work can continue.
2. **Hidden existing wiring issues**: Old wiring found to be non-compliant, damaged, or aluminium (requires special treatment).
3. **Additional circuits needed**: Discovery that the existing switchboard can't handle the planned load without upgrade.
4. **Access difficulties**: Ceiling cavity too low to crawl in, no underfloor access, two-storey walls requiring scaffolding.
5. **Structural changes**: Unexpected structural elements blocking cable routes (steel beams, concrete lintels).
6. **Scope changes**: Homeowner adds or moves power points, lights, or switches after rough-in has started.
7. **Coordination delays**: If other trades are not ready when the electrician arrives (e.g., walls not open, cabinetry not installed), return visits are charged.
8. **Rock/concrete encounters**: Cable routes requiring chasing through solid materials not anticipated in the quote.

### 6.7 Contingency Recommendations

Based on industry consensus, homeowners should:

- **Allow a contingency buffer of 10-15%** of total project cost for unforeseen electrical issues.
- **Request a detailed, itemised quote** with clear inclusions and exclusions.
- **Clarify provisional sums** and understand how variations are handled.
- **Get the electrician involved at the design stage**, not just at quoting stage.
- **Confirm all positions (lights, GPOs, switches) on a marked-up floor plan** before rough-in starts.
- **Take their own photographs** of rough-in work before walls are closed.

## SUMMARY: KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR SCOPE GENERATOR

### For Sequencing Logic
1. Rough-in happens after framing, before plaster. Plumbing typically goes first or concurrent.
2. Second fix happens after plaster, painting (2 coats), tiling, and cabinetry.
3. Final fix/commissioning is the very last electrical step before handover.
4. At minimum, an electrician visits a renovation 3 times (rough-in, second fix, final test/commission).

### For Scope Document Generation
1. Always specify what is "supply and install" vs "install only" vs "rough-in only."
2. Always list exclusions explicitly (switchboard upgrade, asbestos, making good, data cabling, authority fees).
3. Flag switchboard upgrade as a potential additional cost for homes built before 2000.
4. Note that in-floor heating requires testing at three stages.
5. Include a coordination note about confirming all positions before rough-in.
6. Specify that certificate of compliance will be issued upon completion.

### For Exclusion Defaults
1. Data/network cabling (requires separate cabler registration)
2. Security systems (requires security licence)
3. Solar (requires Solar Accreditation Australia accreditation)
4. TV antenna (requires telecommunications registration)
5. Asbestos removal
6. Structural modifications
7. Making good / painting
8. Authority and council fees
9. Builder's coordination margin
