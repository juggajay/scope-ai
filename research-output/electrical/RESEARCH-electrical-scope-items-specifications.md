## SECTION 2D: Living Areas / Bedrooms Electrical

### 2D.1 Lighting Circuits

#### Downlights

**Typical Quantity Per Room:**
- General rule of thumb: 1 downlight per 1.4m2 of floor area at standard ceiling height (2.4-2.7m)
- Bedroom (3.6m x 4.5m = 16.2m2): approximately 6-8 downlights
- Living room (45m2): approximately 9 downlights at 800 lumens each for average 160 lux
- Kitchen: two circuits recommended — task lighting over benchtops and general ambient lighting

**Spacing Rules:**
- Inner lights spaced approximately 900mm to 1,200mm apart
- Minimum 600mm from wall edges to prevent shadow cones on walls
- Minimum 1,000mm from walls for general ambient lighting
- For ceiling height calculation: divide ceiling height by 2 for maximum spacing between fixtures
- Standard 800-lumen downlights with 100-degree beam angle: 1m from wall, then 1.2-1.5m apart

**Dimming:**
- Trailing edge dimmers are strongly recommended for LED downlights (prevents flickering)
- Leading edge dimmers cause flickering and buzzing with most LED downlights
- Ensure LED downlights are specifically labelled "dimmable" — not all LEDs are dimmable
- Check manufacturer dimmer compatibility lists before specifying

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Australian lighting supplier guides (Lumera, McMulten Trades, Reduction Revolution) and industry practice.

- [Downlight Calculator - Reduction Revolution](https://reductionrevolution.com.au/blogs/calculator/downlight)

#### Pendants, Wall Sconces, Feature Lighting, Cove Lighting

**What's involved:**
- Pendants: Require a ceiling junction box at the specified location. Wiring must be rated for the pendant weight. Switching to be specified (which switch controls which pendant)
- Wall sconces: Require wiring to wall location, typically at 1,500-1,800mm above floor level. Mounting box and cable run from nearest circuit
- Feature/accent lighting: Typically uses LED strip (see Section 4: LED Strip Lighting) or dedicated feature fittings. May require separate dimming circuit
- Cove lighting: LED strip installed behind a shadow line or pelmet. Requires driver/transformer concealment location, dimming provisions, and adequate ventilation for the driver

**Standard vs Optional:**
- Downlights: STANDARD for modern Australian renovations
- Pendants: OPTIONAL — specified by client/designer
- Wall sconces: OPTIONAL — typically in bedrooms, hallways, feature walls
- Cove lighting: OPTIONAL — luxury/design feature
- Feature lighting: OPTIONAL — design-driven

**Confidence:** HIGH — Standard Australian renovation practice.

### 2D.2 GPO (General Purpose Outlet) Quantity and Positioning

#### AS/NZS 3000:2018 Requirements

**Minimum GPOs per room:**
AS/NZS 3000:2018 does not prescribe a specific minimum number of GPOs per room in residential dwellings. However, it does state:
- At least one GPO must be provided at both the front and rear of the dwelling (outdoor)
- No point along the exterior wall should be more than 7.5m from an outlet
- Practically, the NCC/BCA and good practice guidelines expect adequate coverage for each habitable room

**Industry Standard Practice (not code minimum):**
- Bedrooms: 4-6 double GPOs (2 per bedside, 1-2 for general use, 1 for desk/dressing)
- Living rooms: 6-10 double GPOs (entertainment wall cluster, lamp positions, general use around perimeter)
- Home office: 4-6 double GPOs plus data points

**Positioning Rules:**
- Standard height (living/bedrooms): 300mm above finished floor level (AFL) — industry standard. AS/NZS 3000 states minimum 75mm AFL but 300mm is universal practice
- Maximum mounting height: 2,000mm AFL (accessibility)
- Kitchen benchtop: 150mm above benchtop surface (approximately 1,050mm AFL depending on bench height)
- Bathroom: minimum 150mm horizontal from basins under 45L, minimum 400mm vertical above basin top. For basins over 45L: 1m above and 0.5m horizontal clearance
- No GPO within 1.2m of shower/bath in bathroom
- Outdoor: minimum 300mm above ground level

**Bedhead GPO Clusters:**
- Modern practice: 2x double GPOs per bedside (one either side of bed)
- Mounting height: 600-700mm AFL (just above mattress level) or at standard 300mm AFL
- Include USB-A/USB-C integrated GPOs for phone charging
- Consider data point (CAT6) at one bedside for smart home integration
- Switched GPOs preferred at bedhead for lamp control from bed

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not enough GPOs on the entertainment wall (TV, soundbar, gaming, streaming devices)
- GPOs hidden behind furniture because of poor planning
- Not coordinating GPO locations with furniture layout
- Omitting bedhead clusters entirely
- Installing GPOs at baseboard height making them difficult to access behind beds

**Compliance:**
- All GPO circuits in residential dwellings must be RCD protected (30mA) per AS/NZS 3000:2018
- Maximum 20A branch circuit rating for socket outlet circuits
- Maximum 12 outlets per 20A circuit (practical guidance)

**Confidence:** HIGH for positioning rules. MEDIUM for minimum quantities (AS/NZS 3000 does not prescribe per-room minimums; quantities are best-practice recommendations).

### 2D.3 TV / Entertainment Provisions

**What's Involved:**
A modern wall-mounted TV installation requires the following electrical provisions:

**Recessed GPO Box Behind TV:**
- Recessed wall point (e.g., Matchmaster 04MM-RP02) designed to sit flush behind wall-mounted TV
- Typically 168mm x 120mm cutout, suitable for 70mm and 90mm wall cavities
- Houses standard GPO plus AV insert slots for Clipsal-type AV connectors
- Paintable faceplate for seamless wall finish

**Power Cluster Behind TV:**
- Minimum 2x double GPOs behind TV (TV, streaming device, soundbar power, game console)
- Recessed box keeps plugs flush so TV sits flat against wall
- Consider quad GPO if space permits

**Data/Signal Points Behind TV:**
- 1x CAT6 data point (for smart TV, streaming device)
- 1x coaxial/F-type TV antenna point (if free-to-air required)
- 1x HDMI conduit: 32mm or 40mm conduit run from TV location down to AV cabinet location (allows HDMI cables to be run inside wall without degradation)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Power cables and data/AV cables should not run in the same conduit. 240V power must be separated from low-voltage signal cabling to prevent interference. A qualified electrician must advise on separation distances.

**Soundbar Power:**
- Dedicated GPO at soundbar height (typically just below TV mount location, approximately 900-1,000mm AFL) or within recessed TV box
- If soundbar is wall-mounted, a separate recessed GPO may be needed

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not running conduit before wall is closed — retrofitting is very expensive
- Insufficient GPOs behind TV (needing powerboards behind a wall-mounted TV looks terrible and is a fire risk)
- Forgetting data point behind TV — relying on WiFi when wired is more reliable
- Not considering cable path from TV to AV cabinet / console below

**Standard vs Optional:**
- Recessed GPO box: STANDARD for wall-mounted TV
- CAT6 behind TV: STANDARD
- HDMI conduit: RECOMMENDED (allows future cable upgrades)
- Antenna point: OPTIONAL (declining relevance with streaming)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on standard Australian AV installation practice and product specifications.

### 2D.4 Dimmer Switches

**Types:**

| Type | Best For | How It Works | LED Compatible? |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Leading Edge (Forward Phase) | Incandescent, halogen, wire-wound transformers | Cuts the leading edge of the AC waveform | Poor — causes flickering/buzzing with most LEDs |
| Trailing Edge (Reverse Phase) | LED, dimmable LED drivers, modern loads | Cuts the trailing edge of the AC waveform | YES — preferred for LED |
| DALI (Digital Addressable Lighting Interface) | Commercial, high-end residential automation | Digital protocol, each fixture individually addressable | YES — requires DALI-compatible drivers |
| 0-10V | Commercial, some residential automation | Separate low-voltage control wire | YES — requires 0-10V compatible drivers |

**For Australian Residential Renovations:**
- **Default recommendation: Trailing edge dimmer for all LED circuits**
- Leading edge dimmers should only be used with incandescent or halogen loads (increasingly rare in renovations)
- Always check the dimmer manufacturer's compatibility list against the specific LED downlight model

**Compatibility Issues:**
- Minimum load problem: Phase-cut dimmers may flicker when circuit load is too low (e.g., only 2-3 small LED downlights). A load correction device can be retrofitted to artificially increase load
- Mixing LED brands on the same dimmer circuit can cause inconsistent dimming
- Replacing halogen downlights (35-50W each) with LED (6-10W each) dramatically reduces circuit load, often requiring dimmer replacement from leading edge to trailing edge

**Multi-Gang Dimmers:**
- Available in 1-gang, 2-gang, 3-gang, and 4-gang configurations
- Each gang independently dims a separate lighting circuit
- Common brands in Australia: Clipsal (Iconic range), HPM/Legrand (Excel Life, Linea), PDL
- Push-button dimmer mechanisms are popular for modern fit-outs (press to toggle on/off, hold to dim)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using a leading edge dimmer with LED downlights (most common error — causes flickering)
- Not checking minimum/maximum wattage rating on dimmer vs total circuit load
- Mixing dimmable and non-dimmable LEDs on the same circuit
- Not specifying trailing edge dimmer in scope — electrician defaults to cheapest (often leading edge)

**Confidence:** HIGH — Well-documented technical specifications.

### 2D.5 Ceiling Fan with Light

**Wiring Requirements:**
- Standard wiring for a ceiling fan with light requires three conductors plus earth: one active for the fan motor, one active for the light, one neutral, and earth
- If replacing a light fitting with a ceiling fan, existing single-switch wiring (2-conductor + earth) will only allow combined control. Separate switching requires pulling new cable
- Cable sizing: Standard 1.5mm2 for lighting circuits is sufficient for most residential ceiling fans. Refer to manufacturer specifications for high-draw models

**Dedicated Circuit:**
- A ceiling fan does NOT typically require a dedicated circuit in Australia
- Multiple ceiling fans can share a lighting circuit — up to 15-20 fans on one circuit is technically permissible
- However, if the fan is on a dimmer circuit, it MUST be on a circuit with a compatible speed controller, not a lighting dimmer

**Switching (Separate Light/Fan):**
- **Best practice:** 2-gang wall switch — one switch for fan, one switch for light
- Fan speed controller: separate wall-mounted controller (rotary or push-button)
- Alternative: remote control kit (receiver in fan canopy, hand-held remote controls both fan speed and light)
- Some modern fans come with WiFi/smart control — wall isolator switch required for safety disconnect

**Fan Speed Controller Types:**
1. **Capacitor-based (stepped):** 3-speed control via capacitor switching. Most common, cheapest, available as wall-mounted rotary dial. Standard with most AC ceiling fans
2. **Electronic/solid-state (variable):** Smoother speed control, quieter operation, more expensive. Works with both AC and DC motors
3. **Remote control:** RF receiver in fan canopy, hand-held remote. Replaces wall-mounted speed controller with a simple isolator switch
4. **Smart/WiFi controller:** App-controlled, compatible with Google Home/Alexa. Requires WiFi connectivity. Wall isolator switch still required

**IMPORTANT: Never use a standard lighting dimmer as a fan speed controller — it will damage the fan motor and create a fire risk.**

**Height Requirements:**
- Minimum 2.1m clearance from floor to lowest point of fan blades (AS/NZS 3000 / BCA)
- Mounting bracket must support minimum 30kg

**Indoor vs Outdoor IP Ratings:**
| Location | Minimum IP Rating | Protection Level |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Indoor (dry) | IP20 | Basic protection |
| Covered outdoor (patio, verandah) | IP44 | Protected against splashing water and objects >1mm |
| Semi-exposed outdoor | IP55 | Protected against water jets and dust |
| Fully exposed | Not recommended | Use purpose-built outdoor rated fan |

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not running 3-conductor cable to allow separate fan/light switching
- Using a lighting dimmer instead of a fan speed controller
- Installing indoor-rated fan in outdoor/exposed location
- Not checking ceiling height — fan too close to floor
- Not verifying mounting structure can support fan weight + vibration

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Australian fan retailers (Martec, Beacon, FansOnline) and AS/NZS 3000.

### 2D.6 Data / Communication Points

**CAT6 vs CAT6A:**

| Specification | CAT6 | CAT6A |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Bandwidth | 250 MHz | 500 MHz |
| Speed | 1 Gbps (full 100m), 10 Gbps (up to 37-55m) | 10 Gbps (full 100m) |
| Cable thickness | Standard | 20-30% thicker, stiffer |
| Shielding | Basic | Enhanced (prevents alien crosstalk) |
| Cost | Baseline | 20-30% more expensive |
| Best for | Most residential (99% of homes today) | New builds, home offices, future-proofing |
| Installation difficulty | Standard | Harder to bend, heavier |

**Recommendation for Renovations:**
- CAT6 is the sweet spot for most Australian residential renovations. It handles gigabit speeds easily across a standard home layout
- CAT6A is worth the extra investment in new builds or serious home office setups where walls are already open — upgrading later is very expensive
- Both support NBN, security cameras, and smart home devices

**IMPORTANT: Data cabling in Australia must be installed by a registered licensed cabler under the Telecommunications Act. This is NOT a DIY job, and it is NOT covered by a standard electrical licence.**

**Patch Panel:**
- Central distribution point, typically located in a communications cabinet (often in garage, laundry, or hallway cupboard)
- Patch panel category must match cable category (CAT6 patch panel for CAT6 cable)
- Star topology: every data point runs individually back to the patch panel (no daisy-chaining)
- Patch panel size: 12-port or 24-port depending on home size

**WiFi Access Point Provisions:**
- Ceiling-mounted PoE (Power over Ethernet) access points provide far better WiFi coverage than router-based WiFi
- Provision: single CAT6 cable run from patch panel to ceiling location in central area of each floor
- No power point needed at access point location — PoE switch or PoE injector at patch panel provides power through the ethernet cable
- Typical cost: approximately $120 per access point (e.g., Ubiquiti, TP-Link Omada)
- Recommended: one access point per floor, centrally located on ceiling

**NBN Connection:**
- NBN Network Termination Device (NTD) typically located at the point of entry to the home
- CAT6 patch lead from NTD to router/patch panel
- If NTD is in an inconvenient location, arrange for it to be relocated during renovation (NBN Co or authorised cabler)
- Ensure communications cabinet has a GPO for NTD, router, and PoE switch power

**Common Mistakes:**
- Running only 1-2 data points when walls are open — run to every room while access is available
- Using CAT5e instead of CAT6 (false economy)
- Not providing a central comms cabinet with power
- Not running a CAT6 cable to ceiling for WiFi access point
- Relying entirely on WiFi mesh instead of wired access points

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Australian structured cabling standards and industry practice.

### 2D.7 Smart Home Provisions

**Smart Switches:**
- Most smart switches in Australia require a NEUTRAL wire at the switch location
- Many older Australian homes (pre-2000) may not have a neutral wire at switch locations — requires electrician assessment
- Some brands (e.g., Zigbee-based options like Aqara) do NOT require neutral wire, but these are less common
- Brands available in Australia: Clipsal Iconic with Wiser (Schneider Electric), Brilliant Smart, HPM Legrand with Netatmo
- Smart switches replace standard switch mechanisms in existing gang boxes

**Automation Hubs:**
- Dedicated GPO in comms cabinet for smart home hub (e.g., SmartThings, Hubitat, Home Assistant)
- CAT6 data point at hub location for reliable connectivity
- Consider future-proofing with GPOs at additional locations for Zigbee/Z-Wave repeaters

**Voice Assistant Power:**
- GPO at each voice assistant location (benchtop, bedside, living area)
- Can share existing GPO or have dedicated outlet
- Kitchen: consider adding to splashback GPO cluster
- Bedroom: include in bedhead GPO cluster

**Motorised Blind Power Points:**
- **Hard-wired option:** 240V AC power point at each window head (top of window frame), typically concealed within the pelmet or window reveal. Provides constant power, no battery replacement
- **Battery-powered option:** No electrical work required — battery-operated motors (e.g., Somfy Sonesse 30) have rechargeable Li-ion batteries lasting up to 1 year. Ideal for retrofit
- **Recommendation for renovations:** If walls are open, install a GPO at each window head where motorised blinds are likely. Even if not used immediately, it is extremely expensive to retrofit later
- Typical mounting: GPO at 2,400mm AFL (just above window frame) or within ceiling cavity above window

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not checking for neutral wire before specifying smart switches
- Not providing power at window heads for future motorised blinds
- Forgetting to include comms cabinet GPO for automation hub
- Not considering protocol compatibility (Zigbee vs Z-Wave vs WiFi) across devices

**Confidence:** HIGH for electrical provisions. MEDIUM for specific product recommendations (products change frequently).

- Circuit rating: minimum 20A branch circuit for outdoor GPOs
- Maximum 12 outlets per 20A circuit

**Weatherproof Design Features:**
- Spring-loaded protective cover over socket that seals when not in use
- Cover rated "in-use" (cover closed while plug inserted) vs "not-in-use" (cover only closes when socket empty)
- For locations where a plug may be left connected during rain (e.g., pool pump, garden lights), an "in-use" rated cover is essential

**Common Mistakes:**
- Installing IP53 rated GPO in fully exposed location (needs IP66 minimum)
- Not providing RCD protection on outdoor circuits
- Mounting GPOs too low (below 300mm) where water can pool
- Forgetting outdoor GPOs entirely — adding them after construction is expensive

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on AS/NZS 3000:2018 and Australian electrical supplier guidelines.

- Typically LED downlights or surface-mount fittings rated for outdoor use
- Minimum IP44 for covered eave locations
- Wired to outdoor lighting circuit with separate switching (or timer/sensor)

**Garden Lighting — 12V Low Voltage vs 240V Mains:**

| Feature | 12V Low Voltage | 240V Mains Voltage |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Safety | Very safe — no shock risk | Requires armoured cable and/or RCD protection |
| Installation | Flexible cable, simple connectors | Must be armoured cable (only last 2m to fitting can be flex), more junction boxes |
| Fault tolerance | Higher — lamp blow doesn't trip circuit | Lamp blow can trip circuit breaker |
| Transformer | Required — 240V to 12V transformer | Not needed |
| Cable runs | Limited by voltage drop (max approx. 15-20m per run at 12V) | Up to 100m without issue |
| Cost | Lower per fitting | Higher per fitting + armoured cable cost |
| Best for | Spike lights, path lights, deck lights, uplights | Bollard lights, flood lights, feature lights needing high output |
| Flexibility | Easy to move and reposition | Fixed installation, difficult to change |

**Step Lights:**

### 2E.7 Gate Motor / Intercom

**Gate Motor Power Supply:**
- Typically 240V AC power supply to gate motor controller
- Must be installed by licensed electrician (240V component)
- Cable run from switchboard or nearest circuit to gate motor location
- Underground cable must be rated for direct burial or in conduit
- Cable sizing: depends on motor; typically 2.5mm2 to 4mm2 for runs up to 100m
- Consider voltage drop on long cable runs

**Intercom Cabling:**
- Intercom wiring is low voltage — can be installed by anyone without electrical licence
- However, quality practice is to use a registered cabler
- Standard cable: CAT5 cable (4 pairs / 8 cores) for analogue audio intercoms
- For direct burial: use cable rated for in-ground installation (tough polythene sheath, gel-filled to prevent moisture ingress)
- Video intercoms may require CAT6 or dedicated coaxial cable
- Maximum run: typically 100m for low voltage systems

**Cable Joining:**
- Never join cable underground unless using gel-filled connectors protected with heat-shrink tubing rated for in-ground use
- If joins required, install an electrical pit (junction box in ground)

**Voltage Threshold:**
- In Australia, any voltage less than 32VAC or 50VDC can be installed by anyone without an electrical licence
- 240V components (motor power supply, transformer) must be installed by licensed electrician

**Common Mistakes:**
- Using indoor-rated cable for underground runs (corrodes quickly)
- Not accounting for voltage drop on long cable runs
- Not protecting low-voltage cable from physical damage in garden areas
- Forgetting to run cable before landscaping/paving is completed

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Australian gate automation installer guidance.

### 2E.8 EV Charger Provisions

**Dedicated Circuit Requirement:**
- AS/NZS 3000:2018 Section P3 requires a dedicated circuit for each EV connection point
- No other appliances or outlets on the same circuit

**Amperage by Australian State (Single Phase):**

| State/Territory | Maximum Single-Phase EVSE | Power Output |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Victoria, NSW, Tasmania | 32A | 7.4 kW |
| ACT, NT | 25A | 5.7 kW |
| SA, QLD, WA | 20A | 4.6 kW |

**Three-Phase:**
- 3-phase 32A EVSE may be installed without network approval in most jurisdictions
- Provides up to 22 kW charging
- Requires three-phase supply to the property (not all homes have this)

**Cable Sizing:**
- 32A circuit: typically 6mm2 cable
- Actual cable size depends on cable run length, derating factors, and installation method
- Longer runs may require upsizing cable to manage voltage drop

**RCD Protection:**
- RCD Type A minimum required for EV charger circuits
- Some chargers have built-in Type A RCD and only require Type AC at the switchboard — check manufacturer specifications

**Switchboard Considerations:**
- Reserve at least 2 pole spaces in switchboard for future EV charger circuit breaker
- If switchboard is full, may require upgrade or replacement
- Consider maximum demand calculation — EV charger adds significant load (7.4 kW at 32A single phase)
- Most Australian single-phase homes have 63A supply (approximately 15 kW total). Adding EV charger may require load management or supply upgrade

**NCC 2025 Provisions:**
- NCC 2025 includes new guidance material on electric vehicle charging provisions in residential buildings
- Encourages EV-ready infrastructure in new builds

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not reserving switchboard space for future EV charger
- Undersizing cable for the run length
- Assuming standard 10A GPO is sufficient (it is for portable 8A charger but not for proper EVSE)
- Not checking state-specific amperage limits
- Not considering maximum demand impact on existing supply

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Electric Vehicle Council EVSE Installation Guideline and AS/NZS 3000:2018.

### 2E.9 Garden Lighting Circuits

**12V Transformer Systems:**

**Transformer Sizing Calculation:**
1. Count total wattage of all connected LED fittings (e.g., 10 x 3W spike lights = 30W)
2. Apply 80% rule: transformer should not be loaded beyond 80% capacity
3. Required transformer size: 30W / 0.8 = 37.5W minimum — select 50W transformer
4. Available sizes: 10W, 20W, 30W, 50W, 60W, 100W, 150W, 200W, 300W

**Voltage Drop:**
- 12V systems are sensitive to voltage drop on long cable runs
- Maximum acceptable voltage drop: 8% (approximately 1V at 12V)
- Use thicker cable (2.5mm2 to 4mm2) for longer runs
- Maximum recommended cable run: approximately 15-20m from transformer at 12V
- For longer runs, consider 24V system or split into multiple transformer zones

**Transformer Location:**
- Must be weatherproof enclosure or installed in protected location (shed, garage, under eave)
- Requires a 240V GPO to power the transformer
- Timer or photocell control on the 240V side for automated operation

**240V Mains Voltage Garden Lighting:**
- Cables must be armoured and/or suitably protected against accidental damage (spading)
- Only the last 2m to the light fitting can be flexible cable
- More junction boxes, less flexibility than 12V
- Licensed electrician required for all 240V outdoor work
- RCD protection mandatory

**Confidence:** HIGH.

### 2F.2 Smoke Alarm Upgrades

**National Requirements (NCC / AS 3786):**
- Must comply with AS 3786 (2014 or superseding 2023 edition)
- Mains-powered (hardwired) where mains power is connected to dwelling
- Interconnected where more than one alarm installed — if one activates, ALL activate
- Photoelectric type recommended nationally (mandatory in QLD, NT)
- Ceiling installation preferred: minimum 300mm from corner junctions
- Wall mounting acceptable: 300-500mm below ceiling junction

**State-by-State Requirements:**

| State | Photoelectric Required? | Hardwired Required? | Interconnected? | Special Notes |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **QLD** | YES (mandatory since 2017) | New builds yes. Retrofits can use 10-year battery | YES — all homes by 1 Jan 2027 | Most stringent. Alarms in EVERY bedroom + hallways |
| **NSW** | Recommended, not mandatory | Post-2006: at least per NCC | Per NCC requirements | Alarms on every level |
| **VIC** | Recommended | Post-1997: mains-powered. Pre-1997: battery OK | Post-May 2014: mandatory | One alarm minimum per level |
| **SA** | Recommended | Post-1995: mains-powered | Post-May 2014: new dwellings | Extensions: alarms in extension must be interconnected (not required to connect to existing building alarms) |
| **WA** | Recommended | Post-July 1997: mains-powered for new builds | Post-May 2015: mandatory | Required for rentals, sales, transfers since Oct 1997 |
| **TAS** | Recommended | Post-Aug 1997: mains-powered | Per NCC | Rentals: every level (mains or 10-year battery) since May 2016 |
| **ACT** | Recommended | Post-Aug 1997: mains-powered | Per NCC | Major renovations requiring permit: minimum one per level hardwired |
| **NT** | YES (mandatory since Nov 2011) | YES (since Jan 1998) | Per NCC | Battery OK for pre-1998 homes |

**Number of Alarms Per Dwelling (NCC General):**
- One on each storey
- In each bedroom (mandatory in QLD, recommended elsewhere)
- In hallways connecting bedrooms to rest of dwelling
- In hallways connecting rooms to exits

**Interconnection Methods:**
- Hardwired: 240V mains wired between all alarms with battery backup (traditional method)
- Wireless RF interconnection: Radio-linked alarms — each alarm sends wireless signal to others. Easier for retrofit where running new cable is impractical. Must comply with AS 3786:2023

**For Renovation Scopes:**
- If renovation requires building permit/approval: smoke alarms must be upgraded to current NCC requirements throughout the ENTIRE dwelling (not just the renovated area) in most jurisdictions
- This is commonly overlooked and can be a significant additional cost

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not upgrading smoke alarms throughout entire dwelling when renovating one room
- Using ionisation alarms instead of photoelectric (ionisation alarms are slower to respond to smouldering fires)
- Not interconnecting alarms
- Installing too close to ceiling corners (min 300mm)
- Not including battery backup on hardwired alarms

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Master Electricians Australia and state fire authorities.

### 2F.3 Data / Network Cabling

Refer to Section 2D.6 for detailed CAT6/CAT6A comparison, patch panel, WiFi access points, and NBN provisions.

**Additional Whole-Home Considerations:**
- Run CAT6 to every habitable room while walls are open
- Typical structured cabling home run list:
  - Each bedroom: 1-2x CAT6
  - Living room: 2-4x CAT6 (TV wall, study nook)
  - Home office: 2-4x CAT6
  - Kitchen: 1x CAT6 (smart home hub, TV)
  - Garage/workshop: 1x CAT6
  - External: 1-2x CAT6 for security cameras, outdoor access points
  - Ceiling access point locations: 1x CAT6 per floor (central ceiling)
- All runs terminate at central patch panel in communications cabinet
- Comms cabinet requires: 2x double GPOs (for NTD, router, PoE switch, patch panel power)
- Label all cables at both ends during installation

**Confidence:** HIGH.

---

### 2F.4 TV Antenna / Distribution

**Components:**
1. **Antenna:** Digital TV antenna (UHF, or combined VHF/UHF depending on location). Mounted on roof or in attic
2. **Masthead Amplifier:** Boosts signal immediately at the antenna before it travels through distribution. Powered by a power supply unit inside the home (typically via wall plate with 12V power injector)
3. **Distribution Amplifier / Splitter:** Splits signal to multiple TV outlets throughout home. Available in 2-way, 4-way, 6-way, and 8-way configurations
4. **Coaxial Cable:** RG6 quad-shield coaxial cable is standard for domestic TV distribution. 75 ohm impedance. F-type connectors
5. **Wall Plates:** Coaxial TV wall plates at each TV location. F-type or PAL-type connector

**Specifications:**
- Distribution amplifiers typically provide 20dB gain
- Centralised amplifier location recommended to minimise cable runs
- Each split reduces signal by approximately 3.5dB, hence amplification is needed
- Power supply: typically 12V DC or via F-type power injector through coaxial cable

**Star Wiring vs Daisy Chain:**
- ALWAYS use star wiring from central distribution amplifier to each outlet
- Never daisy chain TV outlets (causes signal degradation)

**Declining Relevance:**
- Free-to-air TV antenna is becoming less essential as streaming services dominate
- Many renovators are choosing to omit antenna distribution entirely
- Recommendation: At minimum, run conduit to main living area TV location. Full distribution is OPTIONAL

**Confidence:** HIGH.

### 2F.5 Security System Provisions

**Power for CCTV Cameras:**
- **PoE (Power over Ethernet):** Most modern IP cameras use PoE — power and data over a single CAT6 cable from a PoE switch. No separate power cable needed. Recommended approach
- **Traditional CCTV:** Coaxial cable (RG59) + separate DC power cable. Older technology, being replaced by PoE IP
- **WiFi Cameras:** Require only a nearby GPO for power (or battery). No signal cable. Simpler but less reliable than wired
- Provision: Run CAT6 cable from patch panel to each camera mounting location during renovation

**Alarm Panel Power:**
- Dedicated GPO behind alarm panel location (typically hallway or garage)
- Most alarm panels have battery backup — GPO provides continuous charging power
- Low voltage sensor cabling from panel to each sensor point (door contacts, PIR motion detectors, glass-break sensors)

**Sensor Cabling:**
- 4-core or 6-core alarm cable from panel to each sensor location
- Run during renovation when walls are open — virtually impossible to retrofit neatly
- Security cabling can be installed by alarm installer (not required to be a licensed electrician for low voltage)
- However, in Victoria: requires Licensed Security Equipment Installer + Registered ACMA cabler

**Camera Locations (Typical Residential):**
- Front door / entry
- Driveway
- Rear yard
- Side gate
- Garage entry
- Total: typically 4-8 cameras for standard home

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not running cable to camera locations during renovation — retrofit is very expensive
- Using WiFi cameras for all positions (WiFi can be unreliable; wired is always preferred for security)
- Not providing a GPO for alarm panel with battery backup
- Not considering Victorian licensing requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH.

### 2F.6 Doorbell

**Standard Hardwired Doorbell:**
- Low voltage transformer (typically 8-24V AC) hardwired to 240V circuit
- Transformer installed by licensed electrician
- Simple 2-wire cable from transformer to doorbell push button and chime
- Low maintenance, reliable, no battery replacement

**Smart Video Doorbell (Ring, Google Nest, etc.):**

| Specification | Ring Video Doorbell | Google Nest Doorbell (Wired 2nd/3rd Gen) | Google Nest Doorbell (Battery) |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Power | 8-24 VAC transformer OR battery | 16-24 V AC, 10-40 VA transformer (hardwired only) | Battery (or 8-24 VAC for continuous charge) |
| Installation | Licensed electrician required (AU/NZ) | Licensed electrician required (AU/NZ) | DIY possible (battery mode) |
| Wiring | 2-wire from transformer to doorbell | 2-wire from transformer to doorbell | Optional 2-wire for charging |
| WiFi Required | YES | YES | YES |
| Existing Doorbell Compatible | Yes, if transformer meets specs | Yes, if transformer meets specs | Yes (for charging only) |

**Key Points:**
- NEVER connect a smart video doorbell directly to 240V mains — it will be destroyed and is a safety hazard
- If existing doorbell transformer does not meet voltage/VA requirements, it must be replaced by a licensed electrician
- For homes without existing doorbell wiring: either run new low-voltage cable from transformer location, or use battery-powered option
- Provision a GPO near the doorbell/transformer location for potential plug-in power adapter

**Common Mistakes:**
- Connecting video doorbell to 240V mains (will destroy unit)
- Existing transformer too weak for smart doorbell (needs minimum 16V, 10VA for most)
- Not checking WiFi coverage at front door location
- Not running low voltage cable to front door during renovation

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on manufacturer specifications (Ring, Google Nest AU).

### 2F.7 Ducted Air Conditioning Electrical

**Circuit Requirements:**
- Dedicated circuit mandatory — no other loads on the same circuit
- Single-phase ducted systems: typically 20A to 40A dedicated circuit depending on unit size
- Larger single-phase ducted systems (e.g., Daikin FDYQ100LV1 and above): require 40A dedicated circuit
- Three-phase ducted systems: typically 20A per phase, dedicated three-phase circuit
- Circuit breaker sized to manufacturer specifications (always follow installation manual)

**Cable Sizing:**
- Depends on circuit amperage and cable run length
- 20A circuit: typically 2.5mm2 or 4mm2
- 32A circuit: typically 4mm2 or 6mm2
- 40A circuit: typically 6mm2 or 10mm2
- Must comply with AS/NZS 3008 (cable selection) accounting for derating factors

**Three-Phase Considerations:**
- Required for larger ducted systems (typically 14kW+ cooling capacity)
- Three-phase supply uses four wires (three active + one neutral) providing 415V
- If property does not have three-phase supply, it must be applied for from the electricity distributor
- Three-phase supply installation cost: approximately $4,000-$5,000

**Thermostat Wiring:**
- Low voltage control cable from indoor unit to thermostat location (typically in hallway)
- Typically 4-core or 7-core thermostat cable
- Some modern systems use WiFi thermostats — still need power at thermostat location or battery-powered

**RCD/Safety Switch:**
- RCD protection required on dedicated circuit
- Isolator switch at outdoor unit location

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not checking if three-phase supply is needed before committing to large ducted system
- Undersizing cable for the circuit run length
- Not reserving switchboard space for high-amperage dedicated circuit
- Forgetting thermostat cable run during rough-in

**Confidence:** HIGH for general requirements; MEDIUM for specific amperage (varies by manufacturer and model — always follow manufacturer's installation manual which overrides AS/NZS 3000 per the Wiring Rules).

### 2F.8 Split System Air Conditioning Electrical

**Per-Unit Circuit Requirements:**
- Each split system air conditioner typically requires a dedicated circuit
- Mandatory in most jurisdictions under AS/NZS 3000 for units drawing more than 10A
- Even smaller units benefit from dedicated circuits to prevent overloads and ensure RCD protection

**Typical Amp Draw:**
- Small split system (2.5-3.5 kW): approximately 10-12A — may share circuit in some cases
- Medium split system (5-7 kW): approximately 12-15A — dedicated 16A or 20A circuit
- Large split system (7-10 kW): approximately 15-20A — dedicated 20A circuit
- Very large split system (10+ kW): may require 25-32A circuit

**Cable Sizing:**
- 16A circuit: 2.5mm2
- 20A circuit: 2.5mm2 or 4mm2 (depending on run length and derating)
- 25-32A circuit: 4mm2 or 6mm2
- Must comply with AS/NZS 3008. Manufacturer's instructions take precedence

**Outdoor Unit Power:**
- Most residential split systems: power supplied to outdoor unit, which then feeds indoor unit via interconnecting cable
- Some systems: power supplied to indoor unit. Check manufacturer specifications
- Isolator switch required at outdoor unit location (within arm's reach)
- RCD protection mandatory

**Common Mistakes:**
- Putting two split systems on the same circuit (each needs its own)
- Not installing isolator switch at outdoor unit
- Running cable through attic without appropriate derating for temperature
- Not checking manufacturer installation manual for specific requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH.

### 2F.9 Hot Water System — Gas to Electric Changeover

**What's Involved Electrically:**

1. **New Dedicated Circuit:** Electric hot water system (storage element type) typically requires a dedicated 20A circuit. Heat pump hot water may require only 10-15A dedicated circuit
2. **Cable Run:** New cable from switchboard to hot water system location. Cable size depends on circuit rating and run length
3. **Switchboard Modifications:** Additional circuit breaker + RCD/RCBO at switchboard. May require switchboard upgrade if no space available
4. **Off-Peak / Controlled Load:** Electric storage systems are often connected to a controlled load (off-peak tariff) meter connection. This requires a contactor at the switchboard and separate metering. Electrician and electricity retailer must coordinate
5. **Isolator Switch:** At hot water system location for maintenance access

**Heat Pump vs Electric Element:**

| Feature | Heat Pump | Electric Element (Storage) |
|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Typical circuit | 10-15A dedicated | 20-25A dedicated (some 15A) |
| Power draw | Low (compressor only) — typically 600W-1,500W | High (element) — typically 1,800W-4,800W |
| Energy efficiency | Uses 60-75% less electricity than element | Baseline |
| Three phase needed? | No | No (unless instantaneous electric — see below) |
| Off-peak compatible? | Yes (most models) | Yes (commonly connected) |
| Backup element? | Some models include backup element (higher amp draw when active) | N/A — element is primary |
| Cost to run | Low | Moderate to high |
| Typical supply | Hardwired, dedicated 10A circuit | Hardwired, dedicated 20A circuit |

**Instantaneous Electric Hot Water:**
- Requires very high power draw — typically 18-27 kW
- Almost certainly requires three-phase power supply
- Most Australian homes cannot support instantaneous electric without three-phase upgrade
- NOT recommended for gas-to-electric changeover in most cases — heat pump is preferred

**Important Considerations:**
- A plumber AND electrician are both required for gas-to-electric changeover
- Existing gas pipe must be capped/disconnected by licensed gasfitter
- Check maximum demand on switchboard — adding electric HWS increases total home load significantly
- Heat pump is strongly recommended over element for energy efficiency and running cost
- State rebates may be available for heat pump installation (check state energy programs)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Not checking switchboard capacity before committing to changeover
- Choosing instantaneous electric without realising three-phase is needed
- Not connecting to off-peak/controlled load tariff (significantly increases running cost)
- Not considering heat pump as the preferred alternative to element

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Australian energy authority guidance and manufacturer specifications.

## SECTION 4: Common Electrical Items — Detailed Specifications

### 4.1 Downlights

#### IC Rating (Insulation Contact)

**IC vs Non-IC:**

| Rating | Meaning | Insulation Contact Allowed? | When Required |
|--------|---------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Non-IC | No insulation contact | NO — insulation must be cleared around and above. Typically 200mm clearance required | Only acceptable where no insulation is present above ceiling |
| IC | Insulation Contact rated (CA 80) | Can be COVERED by non-flammable insulation rated stable at 90C. 0mm clearance distance | Where ceiling insulation exists but fire rating not required |
| IC-F | Insulation Contact Fire rated | Can be next to AND covered by insulation. Provides fire barrier at ceiling penetration | Where fire-rated ceiling is required (see below) |
| IC-4 | IC + Fire rating (thermal resistance 0.25 m2K/W or greater) | Full contact, 0mm clearance | Recommended as default for all Australian residential installations |

**What IC-4 Means Specifically:**
- Meets AS/NZS 60598.2.20:2018 (Recessed Luminaires standard)
- Can be fully enclosed by insulation with 0mm clearance distance
- Provides thermal resistance of 0.25 m2K/W or greater (reduces heat transfer to insulation)
- Maintains ceiling insulation integrity — no thermal bridging/gaps at downlight locations
- Reduces fire risk — intumescent material expands to seal opening in fire

**When Fire-Rated Downlights Are Required in Australia:**
- When installed in fire-rated ceilings (e.g., between storeys in multi-storey dwellings, between attached dwellings/party walls/floors)
- NCC/BCA requires fire-rated construction between certain building elements. Any penetration (including downlight cut-outs) must maintain the fire rating
- Single storey detached homes with standard plasterboard ceiling: IC-4 strongly RECOMMENDED but fire-rated downlights may not be strictly required
- Two-storey homes: fire-rated downlights typically required in ground floor ceiling (which is the first floor structure)
- Attached dwellings (townhouses, apartments): fire-rated downlights typically required in ceilings adjacent to other dwellings

**Recommendation for Scope:** Specify IC-4 rated downlights as DEFAULT for all residential installations. It costs marginally more and eliminates all insulation contact and fire rating concerns.

#### Colour Temperature

| CCT (Kelvin) | Description | Typical Use |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2700K | Extra warm white | Bedrooms, intimate dining, ambient areas |
| 3000K | Warm white | Living rooms, bedrooms, hallways — most popular residential choice |
| 4000K | Cool white / neutral | Kitchens, bathrooms, home offices, laundry |
| 5000K | Daylight | Garages, workshops, task areas |
| 5700K-6500K | Cool daylight | Commercial, rarely used in residential |
| CCT Selectable (Tri-Colour) | Switchable between 2-3 options via DIP switch on driver | RECOMMENDED — allows adjustment post-installation. Typical options: 3000K/4000K/5700K or 3000K/4000K/6000K |

**Recommendation for Scope:** Specify CCT selectable (tri-colour) downlights as default. Allows homeowner to adjust colour temperature without replacing fittings.

#### Dimmable vs Non-Dimmable

- Always specify DIMMABLE LED downlights unless there is a specific reason not to
- Non-dimmable LEDs are marginally cheaper but cannot be dimmed later without replacement
- Dimmable LEDs work fine on a standard (non-dimmer) switch — they just operate at 100%
- Must pair dimmable LED with compatible TRAILING EDGE dimmer
- Check manufacturer compatibility list — not all dimmers work with all LEDs

#### IP Ratings for Wet Areas

| Location | Minimum IP Rating | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| General living areas (dry) | IP20 | Standard, no moisture protection needed |
| Kitchen (over bench, not directly above sink) | IP20 or IP44 | IP44 recommended |
| Bathroom Zone 2 (0.6m from bath/shower, above sink) | IP44 | Protected from splashes |
| Bathroom Zone 1 (directly above bath/shower) | IP44 minimum, IP65 recommended | Some standards suggest IP65 or IP67 |
| Shower recess (directly in water stream) | IP65 minimum, IP67 preferred | Fully protected against water jets |
| Outdoor (under eave, covered) | IP44 | Protected from splashing |
| Outdoor (semi-exposed) | IP65 | Protected against water jets |

#### Typical Wattage

- Modern LED downlights: 6W-13W (replacing old 50W halogen equivalents)
- Typical output: 600-1,200 lumens per downlight
- 6-8W: suits bedrooms, hallways (approximately 600-800 lumens)
- 9-10W: suits living rooms, kitchens (approximately 800-1,000 lumens)
- 12-13W: high-output for kitchens, commercial (approximately 1,000-1,200 lumens)
- CRI (Colour Rendering Index): CRI90 recommended for residential (accurate colour representation)

#### Cut-Out Sizes

| Cut-Out | Application | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| 70mm | Small downlights, tight spaces | Less common, older standard |
| 75mm | Compact modern downlights | Growing in popularity |
| 90mm | Most common residential standard | RECOMMENDED as default — widest product range |
| 92mm | Some brands (e.g., SAL) | Compatible with 90mm standard |
| 110mm | Larger format downlights | Less common in residential |
| 150mm | Large format / commercial | Rarely used in residential |

**Recommendation for Scope:** Specify 90mm cut-out as standard default unless design requires otherwise.

**Confidence:** HIGH — Based on Australian lighting manufacturer specifications (SAL, Mercator, Clipsal, Brilliant, Atom).

### 4.3 Switches

#### Types Available in Australian Market

| Type | Description | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Rocker (most common) | Standard rocker mechanism. Press top for on, bottom for off | DEFAULT for Australian residential. Available from all brands |
| Toggle | Traditional up/down toggle | Less common in new work, heritage/industrial aesthetic |
| Push-button | Press-to-toggle. Often with LED indicator | Popular for modern/designer fit-outs. Used in Clipsal Iconic, HPM Linea |
| Touch | Capacitive touch panel | Premium smart switch option |

#### Dimmer Types

| Dimmer Type | Compatible Loads | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Leading edge (forward phase) | Incandescent, halogen, wire-wound transformers | Cheapest. NOT recommended for LED |
| Trailing edge (reverse phase) | LED, dimmable LED drivers, all loads | RECOMMENDED for all LED circuits. Smoother, quieter, flicker-free |
| Universal | Both leading and trailing edge loads | More expensive, auto-detects load type. Good retrofit option |
| DALI | DALI-compatible LED drivers | Commercial/high-end residential automation |

**Smart Switch Provisions:**
- Most smart switches require a NEUTRAL wire at the switch location
- Older Australian homes may not have neutral at switch — electrician must assess and potentially run new cable
- Some brands (Aqara, Sonoff) offer no-neutral-required options but these are less common and may have limitations
- Recommendation: If renovating and walls are open, ensure neutral wire is available at every switch location for future smart switch compatibility

#### Fan Speed Controller Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 3-speed rotary dial | Wall-mounted capacitor-based controller. 3 fixed speeds | Standard AC ceiling fans. Most common, cheapest |
| Variable speed electronic | Smooth variable speed control via wall-mounted dial or slider | DC ceiling fans, premium installations |
| Remote control kit | RF receiver in fan canopy + handheld remote. Controls speed + light | Convenience, especially for rooms with limited wall switch access |
| Smart/WiFi controller | App-controlled via smartphone. Voice assistant compatible | Smart home integration. Requires WiFi and wall isolator switch |

**NEVER use a standard lighting dimmer to control fan speed — it will damage the motor and create a fire hazard.**

#### Timer Switches for Exhaust Fans

- Standard in bathrooms and ensuites — exhaust fan runs for set period after light is switched off
- Typical timer: 2-minute, 5-minute, or adjustable run-on timer
- Some combine humidity sensor + timer for automatic operation
- Must comply with AS/NZS 3000 for bathroom zone requirements
- Commonly wired to activate with bathroom light switch, then run-on after light is turned off

#### Sensor / Motion Switches

- PIR occupancy sensors built into switch plate — auto-on when entering room, auto-off after set period
- Suitable for laundry, garage, pantry, hallways
- Adjustable lux level (daylight cutoff) and time delay
- Must have manual override option

#### Two-Way and Intermediate Switching Explained

**Two-Way Switching (2 switches, 1 light):**
- Controls one light from two locations (e.g., top and bottom of stairs, both ends of hallway)
- Uses two 2-way switches. Each switch has 3 terminals: Common (C), 1, and 2
- Two "strapper" wires run between the switches
- Active from switchboard to Common terminal of switch 1. Switched active from Common terminal of switch 2 to light. Strapper wires connect terminals 1-1 and 2-2 between switches

**Intermediate Switching (3+ switches, 1 light):**
- Controls one light from three or more locations (e.g., three entrances to a large room)
- Uses two 2-way switches at the ends, plus one or more intermediate switches in between
- Intermediate switch has 4 terminals — provides a cross-connection between the two strapper wires
- Can add unlimited intermediate switches between the two end 2-way switches

**Legal Note:** All switch wiring in Australia must be performed by a licensed electrician. It is illegal for anyone without a valid electrical licence to perform any wiring work, including replacing a light switch.

**Confidence:** HIGH.

### 4.4 LED Strip Lighting

#### 12V vs 24V

| Feature | 12V | 24V |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Maximum run length | 5m typical before voltage drop | 10m typical before voltage drop |
| Voltage drop sensitivity | HIGH — noticeable dimming on longer runs | LOWER — less voltage drop per metre |
| Component availability | Very common, wide range | Common, growing range |
| Safety | SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) | SELV |
| Best for | Short runs: under-cabinet, kickboard, single cove section | Longer runs: full room cove lighting, stair lighting, extended feature walls |
| LED density options | 30, 60, 120 LEDs/m | 60, 120, 240 LEDs/m |

**CRITICAL: Never connect 12V strip to 24V driver (will destroy strip) or 24V strip to 12V driver (will not function).**

#### Driver / Transformer Requirements

- LED strip requires a constant voltage LED driver (12V or 24V DC output)
- Driver must be rated for total wattage of connected LED strip PLUS 10-15% safety buffer
- Example: 5m of 14.4W/m strip = 72W. Driver required: 72W / 0.85 = approximately 85W. Select 100W driver
- Driver placement: must be accessible for maintenance. Typically in ceiling void, joinery cavity, or dedicated enclosure
- Driver generates heat — must have adequate ventilation. Do not enclose in completely sealed void
- Waterproof drivers available for outdoor/wet area applications

#### Dimming Compatibility

| Dimming Method | How It Works | Best For | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Phase dimming (TRIAC/trailing edge) | Standard wall dimmer controls the 240V input to driver | Simple residential installations | Must use phase-dimmable driver. Standard trailing edge dimmer on wall |
| 0-10V | Separate low-voltage control wire from dimmer to driver | Longer runs, multiple zone control | Requires 0-10V compatible driver + 0-10V dimmer. Extra control wiring needed |
| 1-10V | Similar to 0-10V but minimum is 10% (cannot dim to off) | Commercial, some residential | Driver dims to 10% minimum, switch needed to turn fully off |
| DALI | Digital protocol, individually addressable | Commercial, high-end automation | Requires DALI driver + DALI controller. Most expensive but most flexible |
| PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) | Inline PWM dimmer between driver and strip | Simple DIY, single zone | No special driver needed. Dimmer placed between driver and strip |

**Recommendation for residential:** Phase-dimmable driver with trailing edge wall dimmer is the simplest and most cost-effective solution for most residential applications.

#### Applications

| Application | Typical Specification | IP Rating |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Under-cabinet (kitchen) | 12V or 24V, 60-120 LED/m, 3000K or 4000K, 8-14W/m | IP20 (dry) or IP54 (near sink) |
| Kickboard (kitchen/vanity) | 12V, 30-60 LED/m, 3000K, 4-8W/m | IP54 (splash risk near floor) |
| Cove lighting (ceiling) | 24V, 120 LED/m, 3000K, 14-20W/m | IP20 |
| Stair nosing | 12V, 60 LED/m, 3000K or 4000K, 8-14W/m | IP20 (indoor) or IP65 (outdoor stairs) |
| Bathroom mirror | 12V or 24V, 120 LED/m, 4000K, 14W/m | IP44 minimum (IP65 in Zone 1) |
| Outdoor (deck, eave) | 24V, 60 LED/m, 3000K, 8-14W/m | IP65 or IP67 |

**Common Mistakes:**
- Connecting 12V strip to 24V driver (destroys strip immediately)
- Sealing driver in completely enclosed void (overheats)
- Running strip too long without calculating voltage drop
- Using non-dimmable driver with a dimmer switch (causes flickering/failure)
- Not specifying driver location in scope (electrician needs to know where to mount it)

**Confidence:** HIGH.
