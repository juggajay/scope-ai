## 7.1 Electrician Hourly Rates by City

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

| City | Standard Hourly Rate | Callout/Service Fee | After-Hours/Emergency Rate |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Sydney** | $90 - $130/hr | $80 - $150 | $150 - $300/hr |
| **Melbourne** | $85 - $150/hr | $80 - $150 | $150 - $300/hr |
| **Brisbane** | $80 - $105/hr | $60 - $120 | $130 - $250/hr |
| **Perth** | $85 - $115/hr | $80 - $130 | $140 - $280/hr |
| **Adelaide** | $75 - $110/hr | $80 - $150 | $130 - $250/hr |

**Key notes:**
- Most electricians charge a callout fee covering the first 30-60 minutes on site
- After-hours and weekend rates are typically 1.5x to 2x standard rates
- Master electricians and specialists (e.g., Level 2 ASP) charge at the higher end ($100-$150/hr)
- Apprentice rates are typically half the electrician rate (~$40-$60/hr)
- Many jobs are quoted as fixed-price rather than hourly

## 7.2 Switchboard Upgrade

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

### Basic Modernisation (add RCDs to existing board)

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Single RCD safety switch (supply only) | $190 - $295 |
| RCD supply + installation | $250 - $400 |
| Adding 2x RCDs to existing board (typical minimum) | $400 - $700 |
| Additional circuit breakers | $5 - $100 each |
| Surge protector addition | $200 - $400 installed |

### Full Switchboard Replacement

| Scope | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Basic full replacement (single phase, standard home) | $800 - $1,500 | New board, new RCDs, rewire existing circuits |
| Standard full replacement (typical 3-bed home) | $1,500 - $2,500 | Most common range. Includes new board, all RCDs, circuit breakers, labelling |
| Complex replacement (large home, 3-phase, many circuits) | $2,500 - $5,000+ | May involve 3-phase upgrade, meter box work |
| Switchboard relocation | $1,800 - $4,000+ | Significantly more expensive than in-place replacement. Requires Level 2 ASP for mains work. Power company disconnect/reconnect can add ~$1,000 alone |

### What a Switchboard Upgrade Typically Includes
- New switchboard enclosure (flush or surface mount ~$950 for flush-mount)
- RCDs (safety switches) -- minimum 2 required per AS/NZS 3000
- Circuit breakers for all circuits
- Surge protection device
- Proper labelling of all circuits
- Testing and certification (Certificate of Compliance)
- Permit and inspection fees ($200-$400 typical)

### What It Does NOT Typically Include
- Rewiring of existing circuits (quoted separately)
- Running new circuits (quoted separately)
- Level 2 ASP work for mains upgrades
- Asbestos board removal (if old meter box contains asbestos)

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow a provisional sum of $1,500 - $2,500 for switchboard upgrade" (standard residential). Add note: "Subject to inspection of existing switchboard. Older homes with ceramic fuses or rewirable fuses will require full replacement."

## 7.3 Per-Point Costs (GPOs, Light Points, Switches)

**Confidence:** HIGH (widely documented pricing model)

### What "Per Point" Means in Australian Electrical

In Australian electrical terminology, a **"point"** refers to a single electrical outlet, switch, or fixture connection location. The three main types:

1. **GPO Point (General Purpose Outlet):** A power point/outlet where appliances plug in. A "double GPO" (two sockets in one plate) is still typically counted as ONE point for rough-in pricing, though some electricians count it as two.
2. **Light Point:** A ceiling or wall location where a light fixture connects. The rough-in includes the cable run and junction box -- not the light fitting itself.
3. **Switch Point:** A location where a switch is installed. Usually included with the light point it controls unless it's a separate item (e.g., additional 2-way switch).

### Per-Point Pricing (Rough-In During Renovation)

| Point Type | Cost Range (per point) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Standard single GPO (new, plasterboard wall) | $70 - $150 | Lower end if multiple points done together |
| Standard double GPO (new, plasterboard wall) | $100 - $230 | Most common type installed |
| Double GPO with extra switch | $130 - $260 | For switched outlet or additional light switch |
| USB GPO (integrated USB charging) | $150 - $300+ | Higher-end hardware cost |
| Weatherproof outdoor GPO (IP54/IP66) | $175 - $500+ | Requires weatherproof enclosure, may need new circuit |
| 15A GPO (garage, workshop, caravan plug) | $170 - $460 | Thicker wiring, dedicated circuit often required |
| Light point (cable + junction box, no fitting) | $80 - $150 | Rough-in only. Fitting supply/install additional |
| Switch point (single gang) | $80 - $120 | Usually included with light point above |
| Dimmer switch upgrade | $100 - $200 | Depends on dimmer hardware quality |

### Key Pricing Factors
- **Wall type matters enormously:** Plasterboard wall is standard pricing. Brick, concrete, or tiled walls can double the cost due to chasing and making good.
- **Access:** Easy ceiling/roof space access vs. running through a slab or multi-storey adds cost.
- **Volume discount:** Per-point cost drops when doing many points at once (e.g., full kitchen rough-in). Electricians may quote $80-$100/point for 20+ points, but $150+/point for a single additional GPO callout.
- **Replacement vs. new:** Replacing an existing GPO in the same location is much cheaper ($50-$100) than running a new cable to a new location.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** For rough-in pricing during renovation, use $100-$150 per point as a reasonable mid-range estimate. For budget calculations, count every GPO, light, and switch as one point.

## 7.4 Dedicated Circuit Installation

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented across multiple sources)

| Circuit Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Simple dedicated circuit (e.g., basic lighting) | $650 - $700 | Straightforward cable run, short distance from switchboard |
| Standard dedicated circuit (oven, dishwasher) | $650 - $1,100 | Most common range |
| High-load dedicated circuit (cooktop, AC, hot water) | $800 - $1,500 | May require heavier cable (6mm or 10mm), 32A breaker |
| Induction cooktop dedicated circuit + isolation switch | $800 - $1,500 | Includes hardwiring, isolation switch, safety checks |
| Air conditioning circuit (split system, 15-20A) | $500 - $900 | Electrical only, excludes AC unit installation |
| Air conditioning circuit (ducted, 32-40A) | $800 - $1,500 | Often 3-phase for large ducted systems |

### What's Included in a Dedicated Circuit
- Cable run from switchboard to appliance location
- Circuit breaker at switchboard
- RCD protection (may require adding RCD if board doesn't have one)
- Isolation switch at appliance location (for hardwired appliances)
- Testing and certification

### What's NOT Included
- Switchboard upgrade if board is full (can add $800-$2,500)
- Patching/making good of walls, ceilings (if cable needs to be chased through)
- The appliance itself and its final connection (sometimes quoted separately)

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** Allow $800-$1,100 per dedicated circuit. Note: A typical kitchen renovation requires 3-5 dedicated circuits (oven, cooktop, dishwasher, rangehood if large, potentially fridge).

## 7.5 Downlight Supply & Install

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented across multiple sources)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| LED downlight supply (IC-4 rated, dimmable) | $10 - $50 per light | Good quality IC-4 from ~$10. Premium smart-enabled up to $300 |
| Installation labour (per light, existing circuit) | $50 - $110 per light | Price drops significantly with volume |
| Supply + install combined (standard LED, IC-4) | $60 - $150 per light | Most commonly quoted range |
| New circuit for downlight group | $650 - $1,100 | If existing lighting circuit is at capacity |
| Dimmer switch for LED downlights | $100 - $200 | LED-compatible dimmer required |

### Key Notes
- **IC-4 rating is mandatory** in most installations where insulation is present. IC-4 means the downlight can be fully covered with insulation -- critical for energy efficiency and fire safety.
- **Dimmable vs non-dimmable:** Always specify dimmable. Cost difference is minimal (~$2-$5 per fitting) but retrofitting is expensive.
- **Colour temperature:** 3000K (warm white) is standard for residential. 4000K (cool white) for task areas. Specify in scope.
- **Volume pricing:** 1-2 downlights might cost $150/each installed. A room of 8-10 can bring it down to $70-$90/each.
- **Hole cutting:** Electrician cuts the hole in plasterboard ceiling. If cutting into existing lined ceiling, may need to check for services above.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** Use $80-$120 per downlight (supply + install, IC-4, dimmable, LED) as a reasonable mid-range. For a room of 6-8 downlights, budget $600-$900 total.

**Sources:** [EA Electrics](https://www.eaelectrics.com.au/post/what-does-downlight-installation-cost-in-2024), [Radiance Electrical](https://radianceelectrical.com.au/blog/downlight-installation-costs/), [Local Perth Electrician](https://localperthelectrician.com.au/downlight-installation-cost-perth/), [Yellow Pages](https://www.yellowpages.com.au/articles/electricians-and-electrical-contractors/how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-downlights), [Oneflare](https://www.oneflare.com.au/costs/downlight-installation)

## 7.6 Under-Cabinet LED Strip Lighting

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (less specific Australian data available; some figures derived from international sources)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| LED strip (supply, per linear metre) | $15 - $60/m | Quality varies enormously. Specify CRI 90+ for kitchen use |
| LED driver/transformer (supply) | $30 - $80 each | Size depends on total strip length and wattage |
| Professional installation (complete system, per kitchen) | $400 - $900 total | Includes strip, driver, wiring, switch/dimmer |
| Per linear metre installed (materials + labour) | $50 - $120/m | Varies by access and complexity |
| Dimmer/switch for LED strip | $50 - $150 | Optional but recommended |

### Key Notes
- LED strip quality matters hugely. Cheap strips have poor colour rendering (CRI <80) and fail quickly.
- Driver/transformer must be matched to strip wattage and length. Undersized drivers cause flickering.
- Electrician must hardwire the driver -- it's not a plug-in DIY job if doing it properly.
- Consider "warm dim" strips (3000K-2200K) for premium feel.
- IP20 rated strip is fine for under-cabinet (not wet area). IP65 for near sinks.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow PC sum of $500-$800 for under-cabinet LED strip lighting to kitchen (supply and install, approximately 3-5 linear metres, including LED-compatible driver and switch)."

**Sources:** [Local Perth Electrician](https://localperthelectrician.com.au/cost-to-install-under-cabinet-lighting/), [Houzz Forums](https://www.houzz.com/discussions/2701399/so-how-much-should-led-tape-lighting-cost)

## 7.7 Ceiling Fan Installation

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating Australian sources)

| Installation Type | Cost Range | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Replacement (existing wiring + mounting bracket) | $150 - $200 | Simplest job -- swap old fan for new |
| New installation (wiring exists, new mounting point) | $200 - $350 | Requires mounting bracket, possible ceiling reinforcement |
| New installation (no existing wiring) | $250 - $450 | New cable run from switch/junction box required |
| High ceiling (>3m) or difficult access | $300 - $450+ | Scaffold or extension ladder costs may apply |
| Install only (owner supplies fan) | $100 - $400 | Labour only. Lower end for simple replacement |

### City-Specific Ranges
| City | Typical Range |
|------|--------------|
| Sydney | $150 - $400 |
| Melbourne | $150 - $400 |
| Brisbane | $120 - $350 |
| Perth | $120 - $350 |
| Adelaide | $100 - $300 |

### Key Notes
- Ceiling fan installation MUST be done by a licensed electrician in Australia (wiring + weight/safety).
- If adding a fan where a light was, the existing mounting may not support the fan weight (fans vibrate). Reinforced mounting bracket usually needed.
- Fan with light kit may require a separate switching circuit (one switch for fan, one for light).
- DC motor fans are lighter and more energy efficient but cost more to purchase.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow $200-$350 per ceiling fan for installation (owner to supply fan). Add $50-$100 if new wiring run required."

**Sources:** [KM Electric](https://kmelectric.com.au/ceiling-fan-installation-cost-charges/), [TK Electric](https://tkelectric.com.au/ceiling-fan-installation-costs-a-2025-complete-guide), [Fox Electricians](https://foxelectricians.com.au/how-much-do-electricians-charge-to-install-a-ceiling-fan/), [Airtasker](https://www.airtasker.com/au/costs/ceiling-fan-installation/ceiling-fan-installation-cost/), [ServiceTasker](https://servicetasker.com.au/index.php/cost-guides/how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-a-ceiling-fan)

## 7.8 Smoke Alarm Upgrade

**Confidence:** HIGH (heavily regulated area with well-documented costs)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Single hardwired photoelectric smoke alarm (supply + install) | $150 - $295 per unit | Includes alarm, wiring, interconnection |
| Battery-only photoelectric alarm (supply + install) | $50 - $130 per unit | Wireless interconnection models at higher end |
| Whole-home upgrade (3-bed, ~4-5 alarms, hardwired interconnected) | $500 - $1,200 | Depends on existing wiring and access |
| Whole-home upgrade (3-bed, wireless interconnected) | $400 - $800 | Easier to install but units cost more |

### Compliance Requirements (State-Specific)
| State | Requirement | Deadline |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **QLD** | All homes (including owner-occupied) must have interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms in every bedroom, hallway, and on every level | 1 January 2027 |
| **NSW** | Smoke alarms required on each level. Working alarms must be in place when property sold/leased. Landlords must install in accordance with BCA | Current |
| **VIC** | Smoke alarms must be installed in all residential buildings, on each level, in compliance with Building Regulations | Current |
| **WA/SA** | Smoke alarms required under building regulations. Increasingly moving toward photoelectric, interconnected requirements | Varies |

### Key Notes
- "Interconnected" means if one alarm goes off, they ALL go off. Can be achieved via hardwired (240V with battery backup) or wireless interconnection.
- Renovation triggers compliance -- if you renovate, you must bring smoke alarms up to current code.
- A 4-bedroom home in QLD typically requires 5-7 alarms (each bedroom + hallways + each level).
- Hardwired installation requires a licensed electrician. Battery-only can be DIY (but professional installation recommended for compliance certificate).

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow provisional sum of $600-$1,000 for smoke alarm upgrade to current compliance (supply and install hardwired interconnected photoelectric alarms to all required locations)."

## 7.9 Data Point Installation (CAT6)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (pricing varies significantly with access and cable runs)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Single CAT6 data point (supply + install) | $150 - $300 | Standard run with good roof/wall access |
| Single CAT6 data point (difficult access/long run) | $300 - $500 | Double-storey, concrete slab, limited ceiling access |
| Multiple points (3+ at same time) | $120 - $250/point | Volume discount applies |
| CAT6A data point (higher spec) | $200 - $400/point | Future-proofing for 10Gbps |
| Patch panel / home network cabinet | $200 - $500 | Central distribution point for all data runs |

### Key Notes
- CAT6 supports up to 1Gbps (and 10Gbps over short distances). CAT6A is recommended for future-proofing.
- Each data point includes: cable run from central location, wall plate, termination at both ends.
- Consider running data points to: home office, living room (for streaming/gaming), each bedroom, and near the router location.
- Data cabling can be done by a licensed cabler (not necessarily an electrician, but many electricians hold Open Cabler registration).
- Much cheaper to run data cable during renovation (open walls) than retrofitting later.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow $200-$300 per CAT6 data point (supply and install). For a typical home, allow 4-6 data points."

**Sources:** [Data Cabling Guy](https://datacablingguy.au/how-much-does-network-cabling-installation-cost/), [Local Perth Electrician](https://localperthelectrician.com.au/data-point-installation-cost/), [Whirlpool Forums](https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/3pxjv6xp), [HomeOne Forum](https://forum.homeone.com.au/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=54620)

## 7.10 Outdoor Lighting Circuit

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| New outdoor lighting circuit (from switchboard) | $650 - $1,100 | Dedicated circuit with RCD protection |
| Weatherproof GPO (IP54/IP66, installed) | $175 - $500 | Depends on location and whether new circuit needed |
| Outdoor light point (installed, per point) | $150 - $300 | Includes weatherproof fitting, cable run |
| Typical outdoor package (1x circuit, 1x weatherproof GPO, 3-4 light points) | $1,200 - $2,500 | Depends on cable run distances and access |
| Garden/landscape low-voltage lighting system | $500 - $1,500+ | Transformer + low-voltage cable runs + fittings |

### Key Notes
- Outdoor circuits MUST have RCD protection and use outdoor-rated cable.
- IP ratings matter: IP54 is splash-proof (under eaves), IP66 is weather-proof (fully exposed).
- Sensor/timer switches for outdoor lighting are ~$50-$150 extra.
- Consider conduit for cable protection in exposed runs.
- Solar-powered garden lights are not electrical work (no electrician needed) but are far less reliable than mains-powered.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow provisional sum of $1,500-$2,500 for outdoor lighting package (new circuit, weatherproof GPO, 3-4 outdoor light points). Excludes landscape/garden lighting and light fitting supply."

## 7.11 EV Charger Installation (Electrical Only)

**Confidence:** HIGH (rapidly growing market with well-documented costs)

| Item | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Dedicated 32A single-phase circuit (garage/carport) | $700 - $1,200 | Short cable run from switchboard |
| Dedicated 32A circuit (long run, e.g., detached garage) | $1,200 - $2,500 | Trenching/long cable run adds cost |
| 32A industrial outlet (for portable EV charger) | ~$900 installed | Alternative to hardwired charger unit |
| Switchboard upgrade (if needed for capacity) | $800 - $2,500 | Often needed in older homes |
| Total electrical work (typical, excluding charger unit) | $1,000 - $1,500 | Standard installation, reasonable distance |
| Complex installation (switchboard upgrade + long run) | $2,000 - $4,000+ | Worst case scenario |

### Key Notes
- EV charger circuit must be dedicated (sole circuit, direct to switchboard).
- 32A single-phase delivers ~7.2kW (suitable for most home EV charging).
- 3-phase 32A provides up to 22kW but requires 3-phase supply to the home.
- Older homes may need switchboard upgrade to accommodate the additional 32A load.
- Consider future solar integration -- some smart chargers can divert excess solar to EV.
- Even if not installing an EV charger now, running the cable/conduit during renovation is much cheaper than retrofitting later (see Future-Proofing section).

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow provisional sum of $1,000-$1,500 for EV charger electrical preparation (dedicated 32A circuit from switchboard to garage/carport, including RCD protection). Excludes charger unit. Note: switchboard upgrade may be required (additional cost)."

| Rangehood connection | 1 | $150-$300 | May need dedicated circuit for large rangehoods |
| Fridge GPO | 1 | $100-$200 | Consider dedicated circuit for always-on appliance |
| Under-cabinet LED strip | 1 set | $400-$900 | See Section 7.6 |
| Downlights | 6-10 | $60-$150 each | See Section 7.5 |
| Feature pendant lights (rough-in) | 1-3 | $100-$200 each | Rough-in only; light fitting supply separate |
| Light switches / dimmers | 2-4 | $80-$200 each | LED-compatible dimmers recommended |
| Microwave GPO | 1 | $100-$200 | Often high on wall or inside pantry |
| Waste disposal unit GPO | 0-1 | $100-$200 | Under-sink, switched |
| Smoke alarm (kitchen adjacent) | 1 | $150-$295 | Heat alarm in kitchen, smoke alarm nearby |

### Typical Total Kitchen Electrical Package

| Kitchen Size | Approximate Total | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Small/basic kitchen reno | $3,000 - $5,000 | Minimal changes, reusing existing circuits |
| Medium kitchen reno (most common) | $5,000 - $8,000 | New dedicated circuits, new GPOs, downlights |
| Large/premium kitchen reno | $8,000 - $15,000+ | Multiple dedicated circuits, extensive downlighting, feature lighting, smart controls, under-cabinet lighting |

### Key Notes
- Kitchen is typically the MOST electrical-intensive room in a house.
- Induction cooktops draw 20-60A and nearly always require switchboard assessment.
- GPO placement should be planned around the kitchen design/cabinetry plan.
- Some items are frequently missed from kitchen electrical scopes: rangehood, waste disposal, under-cabinet lighting, in-pantry light and GPO.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow provisional sum of $5,000-$8,000 for kitchen electrical rough-in and fit-off (includes dedicated circuits for oven, cooktop, and dishwasher; benchtop GPOs; downlighting; switching). Excludes light fitting supply, appliance supply, and any switchboard upgrade."

## 7.13 Bathroom Electrical Rough-In

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (compiled from multiple sources)

### Typical Bathroom Electrical Items

| Item | Qty (Typical) | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| 3-in-1 unit (heat/light/exhaust fan) | 1 | $300-$600 installed | 4-heat units often need new dedicated circuit |
| Exhaust fan (standalone) | 1 | $150-$400 installed | Ducted to outside. Timer switch recommended |
| Downlights | 3-6 | $60-$150 each | IC-4, IP44 rated for above shower |
| Vanity light point | 1-2 | $100-$200 each | For wall sconces or mirror lights |
| GPO (vanity area) | 1-2 | $100-$230 each | Must comply with zone requirements (min distance from water) |
| Heated towel rail connection | 0-1 | $150-$350 | Hardwired preferred; GPO behind unit alternative |
| Shaver socket | 0-1 | $100-$200 | Specialist low-voltage outlet near basin |
| Light switch(es) | 2-3 | $80-$150 each | Separate switches for fan, lights, heater |
| Smoke alarm (corridor near bathroom) | 1 | $150-$295 | Not in the bathroom itself (moisture) |
| Dedicated circuit (if 4-heat IXL unit) | 0-1 | $650-$1,100 | Required for large heater units |

### Typical Total Bathroom Electrical Package

| Bathroom Scope | Approximate Total | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Basic bathroom refresh (like-for-like) | $1,500 - $2,500 | Replacing existing fittings in same positions |
| Standard bathroom renovation | $2,000 - $4,000 | New positions, new lighting plan, heated towel rail |
| Premium bathroom renovation | $4,000 - $6,000+ | Multiple circuits, feature lighting, smart controls |

### Key Notes
- Bathroom electrical has strict zoning requirements (AS/NZS 3000 Section 6.2). Electricians must comply with zones 0, 1, 2, and 3 for placement of fittings and GPOs relative to baths and showers.
- IP ratings are critical: IP44 minimum for Zone 2 (above shower), IP27 minimum for Zone 1.
- Heated towel rails should ideally be hardwired (not plugged in) for a clean look and safety.
- Exhaust fans should be ducted to outside (not just into ceiling space) per building code.
- The electrician visits the bathroom minimum twice: rough-in (before tiling) and fit-off (after tiling). Coordinate with tiler/waterproofer timing.

**PC Sum Guidance for AI:** "Allow provisional sum of $2,000-$4,000 for bathroom electrical rough-in and fit-off (includes exhaust fan or 3-in-1 unit, downlights, vanity GPO, heated towel rail point, switching). Excludes light fitting supply and any switchboard upgrade."

# SECTION 8: HOMEOWNER MISTAKES & RED FLAGS

---

## 8.1 Most Common Items Homeowners Forget

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent themes across multiple Australian sources)

### Items Frequently Left Out of Renovation Plans

| Forgotten Item | Why It's Missed | Typical Cost Impact |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Switchboard upgrade** | Homeowner assumes existing board is fine. Old boards with ceramic/rewirable fuses cannot accept new RCDs. | $1,500-$2,500 unexpected |
| **Dedicated circuit for induction cooktop** | Homeowner switches from gas to induction without realising it needs 32A dedicated circuit + potentially switchboard upgrade | $800-$2,500 unexpected |
| **Smoke alarm compliance** | Renovation triggers requirement to bring alarms to current code. Most homeowners don't know this. | $500-$1,200 unexpected |
| **Rangehood electrical connection** | Often forgotten because it's "part of the kitchen" but electrician needs to run a dedicated connection | $200-$500 unexpected |
| **Under-cabinet lighting** | Decided on after kitchen is built. Running cable after cabinetry is installed is much harder and more expensive | $400-$900 (or more if retrofit) |
| **In-pantry light and GPO** | Walk-in pantry or butler's pantry needs its own light and power point | $200-$400 |
| **Waste disposal unit connection** | Under-sink switched GPO for InSinkErator-type unit. Forgotten until plumber asks "where's the power?" | $150-$300 |
| **USB power points** | Homeowners assume all GPOs have USB. They don't unless specified. | $50-$100 extra per point |
| **Dimmer switches** | Homeowners want dimmable lights but forget to specify dimmer switches (or specify non-dimmable LEDs) | $100-$200 per dimmer |
| **External GPO** | Outdoor entertaining area power. Forgotten until the BBQ/TV/heater needs plugging in. | $175-$500 |
| **Heated towel rail connection** | Bathroom designed without considering where the electrical connection for the towel rail will go | $150-$350 |
| **TV/data point behind wall-mounted TV** | Cables running down the wall look messy. Needs a recessed GPO and data point behind where TV mounts | $250-$500 |
| **Extra GPOs in bedroom** | Homeowners focus on kitchen/bathroom and forget that every bedroom needs GPOs on multiple walls (bedside tables, desk, wardrobe) | $100-$230 per point |
| **Garage/laundry GPOs** | These rooms get neglected. Often need 15A GPOs for tools, dryer, etc. | $170-$460 per 15A point |
| **Sensor lights (entrance, hallway)** | Convenient but needs to be specified -- electrician won't assume sensor switches | $100-$200 per sensor switch |

### "Small" Items That Add Up

These items seem individually small but collectively can add $1,000-$3,000 to a budget:
- Upgrading every switch to a specific brand/style (e.g., Clipsal Iconic, PDL Iconic) -- add $20-$80 per switch plate above standard
- Adding extra GPOs (most homeowners want 30-50% more than they initially planned)
- Dimmer switches instead of standard switches
- USB charging outlets
- Adding weatherproofing to outdoor points
- Additional 2-way switching (light controlled from two locations)
- Adding sensor/timer switches

## 8.2 Expensive Surprises

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Things Homeowners Assume Are Cheap But Are Actually Expensive

| Surprise Item | What Homeowners Think | Reality | Typical Cost |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Moving a switchboard** | "Just move it to the garage" | Requires Level 2 ASP, power company disconnect/reconnect (~$1,000 just for that), new cabling. Major job. | $1,800-$4,000+ |
| **Adding circuits to a full switchboard** | "Just add one more circuit" | If the board is full, you need a new switchboard first. No room = full replacement. | $1,500-$2,500 for board + circuit cost |
| **Running cables through concrete slab** | "Just run a cable under the floor" | Concrete slab = cannot run cables through it easily. Often requires conduit installation during slab pour, or expensive chasing/routing above. | $500-$2,000+ additional |
| **Moving power points in tiled walls** | "Just shift it across 300mm" | Requires cutting tiles, chasing brick, re-tiling, waterproofing repair. A whole-day job for a simple move. | $400-$800+ per point |
| **Switching from gas to induction cooktop** | "Just swap it" | Needs dedicated 32A circuit, possible switchboard upgrade, gas cap-off (separate gasfitter), isolation switch. | $1,000-$3,000 total |
| **Adding a ceiling fan where no wiring exists** | "Just hang it up" | No wiring means new cable run, ceiling reinforcement, possibly new circuit. Not a 30-minute job. | $250-$450 |
| **Rewiring an old house** | "A few thousand" | Full house rewire is $8,000-$20,000+ for a 3-bed home. Involves access to every wall/ceiling space. | $8,000-$20,000+ |

### Common Scope Items That Cause Variations (Unexpected Extra Costs)

| Variation Trigger | What Happens | How to Prevent |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Asbestos found in switchboard/meter box** | Must be removed by licensed asbestos removalist before electrical work can proceed | Pre-renovation asbestos inspection |
| **Old wiring discovered (VIR/TPS)** | Existing circuits may need rewiring for safety. Cannot connect new work to deteriorated wiring. | Pre-renovation electrical inspection |
| **Board is full** | Electrician arrives to add circuits, discovers no spare capacity. Switchboard upgrade needed first. | Include switchboard assessment in scope |
| **No neutral at switch locations** | Smart switches require neutral wire. Old "loop at light" wiring doesn't provide neutral at switch. Rewire needed. | Specify in scope; check during rough-in |
| **Access issues discovered** | Ceiling space full of ductwork, structural beams, or too low to access. Cable runs become much longer/harder. | Site inspection before quoting |
| **Non-compliant existing work** | Electrician discovers previous unlicensed work, unsafe wiring, no earth. Must rectify before new work. | Pre-renovation inspection |
| **Coordination with other trades** | Electrician can't rough-in until framing is done. Fit-off can't happen until plaster/tiles are done. Delays = return visits = extra cost. | Clear renovation schedule with builder |

### What Triggers an Electrician to Say "That's Extra"

1. **Any change from the quoted scope** -- adding even one extra GPO is a variation
2. **Access worse than expected** -- "you didn't mention the ceiling space was only 300mm high"
3. **Existing wiring in poor condition** -- they can't connect new work to unsafe old work
4. **Switchboard full** -- "there's no room for another circuit breaker"
5. **Needing to come back extra times** -- electrician expected one rough-in visit, but plasterer/tiler wasn't ready
6. **Patching/making good** -- most electricians exclude plaster patching, painting, tile repair
7. **Working around other trades** -- having to work in a room that's not ready
8. **Asbestos, lead paint, or other hazardous materials encountered**
9. **Different product than quoted** -- homeowner changes from specified fitting to something that requires different wiring
10. **After-hours work** -- "can you come on Saturday?" = penalty rates

## 8.3 Red Flags When Reviewing Quotes

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Red Flags That a Quote Is Too Cheap

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean |
|----------|-------------------|
| Vague, one-line quote (e.g., "Kitchen electrical - $3,000") | No detail means no accountability. Scope will be interpreted in electrician's favour. |
| No mention of RCDs or safety switches | May be planning to skip mandatory safety requirements |
| No mention of testing and certification | Every job requires a Certificate of Compliance. If not mentioned, they may not provide one. |
| No licence number on quote | May not be licensed. Verify at your state's electrical licensing authority. |
| Verbal quote only -- nothing in writing | No legal protection. Always insist on written quotes. |
| "We'll sort out the switchboard later" | They know it needs upgrading but are hiding the cost to win the job |
| Using unbranded/cheap components | "Similar quality" substitutions can mean non-compliant or unreliable products |
| No mention of make-good/patching | Will leave holes in your walls and ceiling without repairing them |
| Significantly cheaper than other quotes (>30% less) | Either missing scope items, planning to use cheap materials, or not including compliance requirements |
| No insurance mentioned | If something goes wrong, you have no protection |

### Red Flags That a Quote Is Too Expensive

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean |
|----------|-------------------|
| Including items you didn't ask for (and can't explain why) | Padding the quote with unnecessary work |
| Specifying premium brands when not needed | Charging for Clipsal Saturn throughout when standard Iconic would do |
| Quoting for full rewire when only partial work needed | Over-scoping to inflate the job |
| Charging separately for items that should be included | E.g., charging extra for circuit breakers in a switchboard upgrade |
| Excessive "contingency" or "provisional" amounts | Sometimes legitimate, but should be itemised and explained |
| Not breaking down labour vs materials | Makes it impossible to compare with other quotes |

### How to Tell If Exclusions Are Reasonable vs Hiding Costs

**Reasonable exclusions (standard practice):**
- Supply of light fittings, fans, appliances (these are typically owner-supplied/PC items)
- Plaster patching, painting, tiling (these are other trades' work)
- Builder's/plasterer's work for access
- Council/permit fees
- Asbestos removal (separate specialist trade)
- Switchboard upgrade IF clearly flagged as "subject to inspection"

**Unreasonable exclusions (hiding costs):**
- Excluding testing and certification (this is legally required and should be included)
- Excluding RCDs/safety switches on new circuits (mandatory under AS/NZS 3000)
- Excluding cable/wiring (what are they quoting then?)
- "Excludes any additional work required" (this is too vague -- what additional work?)
- Excluding cleanup of own work area

### Questions Homeowners Should Ask Before Accepting a Quote

1. "Are you licensed? Can I have your licence number to verify?" (Check at state authority website)
2. "Do you have current public liability insurance? What's the coverage amount?" (Minimum $5M recommended)
3. "Does this quote include a Certificate of Compliance/Electrical Safety Certificate?"
4. "Will the switchboard need upgrading? Have you assessed it?"
5. "Is everything in this quote RCD-protected as required by AS/NZS 3000?"
6. "What's included and what's excluded? Can you be specific about exclusions?"
7. "How many site visits are required? (rough-in, fit-off, others?)"
8. "What happens if you discover unexpected issues (old wiring, asbestos, full switchboard)?"
9. "Are materials/fittings specified? What brands?"
10. "What's the payment schedule? Do you require a deposit?"
11. "What warranty do you provide on workmanship?" (Industry standard: 12 months minimum)
12. "Can you provide references from similar renovation projects?"
13. "What's the estimated timeline, and how does your work coordinate with other trades?"

## 8.4 Common Misunderstandings

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent themes across trade and consumer sources)

### 1. "The Electrician Will Sort Out the Lights"

**What homeowners think:** The electrician will design the lighting layout, choose the fittings, and make it look great.

**Reality:** The electrician installs what is specified. If you say "I want downlights in the kitchen" without specifying quantity, position, colour temperature, or dimming, the electrician will make practical decisions that may not match your aesthetic vision. They are tradespeople, not lighting designers.

**What the scope should say:** "Install 8x LED downlights, IC-4 rated, dimmable, 3000K warm white, positioned per lighting plan (attached). Connect to LED-compatible dimmer switch at kitchen entry."

### 2. "GPOs Are Included -- They're Just Power Points, Right?"

**What homeowners think:** When the electrician quotes "kitchen electrical," it includes all the power points they need.

**Reality:** Unless every GPO location is specified in the scope, the electrician quotes only what is listed. "Kitchen electrical" could mean anything from 2 GPOs to 12. Each additional GPO is $100-$230.

**What the scope should say:** "Install 6x double GPOs to kitchen benchtop (positions per kitchen plan). Install 1x double GPO behind fridge. Install 1x single GPO under sink (switched, for waste disposal). Install 1x double GPO inside pantry."

### 3. "Rough-In and Fit-Off -- Why Does the Electrician Come Twice?"

**What homeowners think:** The electrician comes once, does everything, and it's done.

**Reality:** Electrical work happens in minimum two phases:
- **Rough-in** (First Fix): After framing/demolition, before plasterboard/tiling. Electrician runs all cables through wall and ceiling cavities, installs mounting boxes, and connects at switchboard. Walls/ceilings are then closed up by plasterer.
- **Fit-off** (Second Fix): After plaster, painting, tiling is complete. Electrician returns to install the visible items: switches, GPO covers, light fittings, fans, etc.

Some jobs require a third visit for final testing, connection of hardwired appliances, or dealing with items that weren't ready at fit-off.

**Each visit has a callout fee.** The cost of the second visit should be included in the original quote, but check.

### 4. "The Switchboard Is Fine -- It's Only 30 Years Old"

**What homeowners think:** The switchboard works, lights turn on, nothing's wrong.

**Reality:** A 30-year-old switchboard likely has:
- No RCDs (safety switches) -- or only 1 where minimum 2 are now required
- Rewirable fuses or ceramic fuses instead of modern circuit breakers
- No surge protection
- Possibly no spare capacity for new circuits
- Wiring that doesn't meet current standards

**Any renovation that adds new circuits triggers the requirement for the new circuits to have RCD protection.** If the board can't accommodate RCDs, the board needs upgrading.

**Warning signs of an old switchboard that needs upgrading:**
- Rewirable (porcelain) fuses instead of circuit breakers
- Fewer than 2 RCDs
- No circuit labelling
- Burn marks, discolouration, or smell of burning
- Regularly tripping breakers
- Unable to fit additional circuit breakers

### 5. "This Work Doesn't Need Council Approval"

**What homeowners think:** Electrical work is just "trades work" and doesn't need permits.

**Reality:** While most standard electrical work doesn't need council building approval (just a Certificate of Compliance from the electrician), some work does require permits or approvals:
- Switchboard relocation may need council approval
- Major upgrades may trigger requirements for the rest of the home to be brought to compliance
- Work that involves structural changes (chasing through load-bearing walls) needs building approval
- Solar panel installations often need council/network approval
- EV charger installations may need network provider approval (for load management)
- In some states, all electrical work must be notified to the electrical safety regulator

**The electrician is legally required to lodge a Certificate of Compliance (or equivalent) for all work performed. Always ask for this document.**

## 8.5 Future-Proofing Considerations

**Confidence:** HIGH (strongly recommended by industry professionals)

### Items Homeowners Should Consider NOW to Avoid Expensive Retrofitting Later

| Future Need | What to Do NOW During Renovation | Cost Now | Cost to Retrofit Later |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| **EV charger** | Run 6mm or 10mm cable (or conduit) from switchboard to garage/carport. Install a spare 32A breaker at switchboard. Even if you don't install the charger now, the cable is in place. | $300-$600 (cable only) | $1,000-$2,500+ (cutting into finished walls/ceilings) |
| **Solar panels** | Ensure switchboard has spare capacity (minimum 2 spare circuit breaker spaces). Install conduit from roof space to switchboard location. | $100-$300 (conduit + spare breakers) | $500-$1,500 (switchboard upgrade + cable routing) |
| **Smart switches** | Run neutral wire to ALL switch locations. Most smart switches require a neutral wire. Older Australian homes use "loop at light" wiring which doesn't provide neutral at the switch. | $30-$50 extra per switch location during rough-in | $200-$500+ per switch (rewire through finished walls) |
| **Smart home hub/network** | Install a small data cabinet (patch panel) in a central location with good ventilation. Run CAT6 to key rooms. Run conduit to locations where future devices might go. | $500-$1,500 (hub + 4-6 data points + conduit) | $2,000-$5,000+ (retrofitting data cable through finished walls) |
| **Heated towel rail** | Run a cable and install a connection point behind where the towel rail will go, even if you're not installing the rail now. | $100-$200 (cable run + junction box) | $300-$600 (cutting tiles, chasing walls, re-waterproofing) |
| **Home office** | Install dedicated circuit, multiple GPOs, and data points in home office location. Consider separate lighting circuit. | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 |
| **Extra switchboard capacity** | Install a switchboard with 30-40% more circuit breaker spaces than currently needed. Small additional cost for a larger enclosure. | $100-$300 extra for larger board | $1,500-$2,500 (full switchboard replacement) |
| **Outdoor entertaining** | Run conduit from house to outdoor area for future outdoor kitchen, TV, heaters, audio. | $200-$500 (conduit only) | $800-$2,000 (trenching, cable, making good) |
| **Ceiling fan** | Install a fan-rated ceiling box and pull a cable to the location even if not installing a fan now. Especially in bedrooms. | $80-$150 per location | $250-$450 (cutting into finished ceiling, new cable run) |
| **Battery storage** | Ensure switchboard location has adequate wall space for a future battery system. Run conduit from switchboard to potential battery location (garage wall, outside wall). | $100-$300 | $500-$1,500 |

### Key Principle
> **"If the walls are open, run the cable."** The cost of running an extra cable or conduit during renovation is a fraction of the cost of retrofitting later. Cable and conduit are cheap. Labour to open and close walls is expensive.

### Recommended "Future-Proofing Package" for AI to Suggest
When walls are open during renovation, recommend homeowners consider adding:
1. Neutral wires to all switch locations ($30-$50 per switch extra)
2. Conduit from switchboard to garage/carport for EV charger ($200-$400)
3. 2x spare breaker spaces in switchboard ($50-$100 for slightly larger board)
4. CAT6 data points to living room, home office, and master bedroom ($150-$300/point)
5. Conduit from roof space to switchboard for future solar ($100-$200)

**Approximate total for future-proofing package: $800-$2,000 extra during renovation**
**Approximate cost to retrofit all the above later: $5,000-$15,000+**

## 9.2 Level of Detail (Goldilocks Zone)

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on industry best practice analysis)

### Too Vague (Bad)
```
- Install some lights in the kitchen
- Kitchen power points
- Wire up the bathroom
- Fix the switchboard
```
**Problem:** The electrician will interpret this minimally. "Some lights" could mean 2 or 12. "Kitchen power points" gives no quantity or position. Disputes are inevitable.

### Too Prescriptive (Also Bad)
```
- Install 1x Clipsal 10W Saturn Zen LED downlight, model CSC4104T2,
  CRI 95, beam angle 60 degrees, IP44, in brushed nickel finish,
  at exactly 1200mm from north wall and 800mm from east wall,
  connected via 2.5mm TPS cable in 20mm conduit, on Circuit 14,
  protected by Schneider Acti9 iC60N C10 MCB...
```
**Problem:** Over-specification locks you into specific products (which may be unavailable), adds cost, makes quoting harder, and doesn't leave room for the electrician's professional judgement on best practice.

### Just Right (Good)
```
- Supply and install 8x LED downlights to kitchen, IC-4 rated,
  dimmable, 3000K warm white, positioned per lighting plan (attached).
  Allow PC sum of $40 per downlight for owner-selected fitting.

- Supply and install 6x double GPOs to kitchen benchtop, positioned
  per kitchen plan. GPOs to be white, matching Clipsal Iconic range
  (or equivalent). Height: 150mm above benchtop.

- Supply and install 1x dedicated 32A circuit from switchboard to
  cooktop position, including isolation switch. Circuit to be suitable
  for induction cooktop up to 7.4kW.
```
**Why this works:**
- Specifies quantity and type
- Includes critical specifications (IC-4, dimmable, 3000K, 32A)
- References a plan for positioning
- Uses "or equivalent" to allow flexibility
- Includes PC sum for owner-selected items
- Leaves professional decisions (cable sizing, circuit protection) to the electrician

## 9.3 How PC Sums and Allowances Are Written

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on HIA contract guidance and industry practice)

### Definitions (Australian Building Contract Context)

**Prime Cost (PC) Item:**
- An item that will be **supplied** by the owner (or selected by the owner for the builder/electrician to supply)
- The allowance covers **supply cost only** -- NOT installation
- Used when the owner hasn't selected the specific product yet
- Example: light fittings, fans, switch plate styles

**Provisional Sum (PS):**
- An **estimated amount for work** (materials + labour) where the scope is not yet fully defined
- Used when there's uncertainty about the extent of work required
- Example: "Switchboard upgrade -- provisional sum of $2,000" (actual cost may be more or less depending on what's found)

### How They're Written in Practice

**PC Sum Format:**
```
Item: 8x LED downlights to kitchen
PC Allowance: $40 per fitting ($320 total) for owner-selected LED downlight,
IC-4 rated, dimmable, 3000K
Installation cost: Included in electrical quote
Note: If actual fitting cost exceeds PC allowance, difference will be added
to contract price plus margin.
```

**Provisional Sum Format:**
```
Item: Switchboard upgrade
Provisional Sum: $2,000
Scope: Remove existing switchboard and replace with new switchboard to comply
with AS/NZS 3000, including all RCDs, circuit breakers, surge protection,
testing and certification.
Note: Provisional sum is an estimate only. Actual cost will be determined
after inspection of existing switchboard. Any difference (more or less)
will be adjusted against the contract price.
```

**Allowance Format (Simpler):**
```
Allow $1,500 for bathroom light fittings (supply only).
Owner to select fittings. Installation included in electrical scope.
```

### HIA Contract Structure (Schedule 7)
In HIA residential building contracts, PC and PS items are listed in Schedule 7 with:
- Item description
- Allowance amount
- Whether it's a PC (supply only) or PS (supply + labour)
- The builder's margin percentage that applies to any cost difference (default 20% if not specified)

### Key Rule for the AI
When the AI generates a scope, it should use:
- **PC sum** for items the homeowner will select (light fittings, fans, switch styles, appliances)
- **Provisional sum** for work that can't be fully defined until the electrician inspects (switchboard upgrade, remediation of existing wiring, work dependent on hidden conditions)
- **Fixed price** for standard work items (GPO installation, circuit runs, rough-in) where the scope is clear

## 9.6 What Format Do Electricians Prefer?

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (based on trade forums and electrician company websites; no formal survey data)

### Preferred Formats

1. **PDF document** with a clear scope list is the most professional and preferred format. Electricians can print it, mark it up on site, and reference it during the job.

2. **Bullet-point list** organised by room/area. Simple, clear, easy to quote against. This is what most electricians work with day-to-day.

3. **Annotated floor plan** is extremely valuable. Showing GPO positions, light positions, switch positions, and cable runs on the actual architectural plan removes ambiguity. Many electricians will mark up a floor plan during a site visit.

4. **Detailed specification sheet** is appreciated for larger jobs but overkill for a simple bathroom reno. Reserve this level of detail for whole-house renovations or new builds.

### What Electricians DON'T Want
- Vague verbal descriptions ("just make it nice")
- Overly technical specifications that constrain their professional judgement
- Incomplete information that requires multiple clarification calls
- Scope items mixed in with general renovation notes (they want THEIR scope separated out)
- Pinterest boards without any technical specification ("I want it to look like this" -- but what IS it?)

### Ideal Submission to an Electrician
1. A clear scope of works document (PDF or printed) organised by room
2. An annotated floor plan showing positions of GPOs, lights, and switches
3. A lighting plan (if available from a lighting designer or kitchen designer)
4. Appliance specifications (for any hardwired appliances -- oven, cooktop, AC)
5. Photos of current switchboard, existing wiring (if visible), and areas to be worked on
6. Access information (single or double storey, roof space access, wall types)
7. Timeline and coordination information (when will walls be open, when is plaster being done)

## 9.7 Information Electricians Need for Accurate Quotes

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Information | Why It's Needed | How to Provide It |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Floor plan / architectural drawings** | To understand layout, distances, cable runs | PDF or printed copy, annotated with electrical needs |
| **Kitchen/bathroom design plans** | To plan GPO and lighting positions relative to cabinetry | From kitchen designer or bathroom designer |
| **Appliance specifications** | To size circuits correctly (amps, watts, voltage) | Product spec sheets or model numbers |
| **Current switchboard photos** | To assess age, capacity, compliance status | Clear photos of open switchboard |
| **Access details** | Affects cable routing and labour time | Note: single/double storey, roof access, wall types (plaster/brick/concrete) |
| **Scope of renovation** | To understand what walls are being opened, moved, or built | Builder's scope or renovation plan |
| **Desired switch/GPO style** | To quote correct hardware | Brand/range name (e.g., "Clipsal Iconic white") |
| **Lighting preferences** | To plan circuits and dimming | Warm/cool white, dimmable/not, type (downlight/pendant/strip) |
| **Timeline** | To schedule rough-in and fit-off around other trades | Renovation schedule showing key milestones |
| **Future plans** | To allow for future capacity | EV charger, solar, extensions, etc. |
