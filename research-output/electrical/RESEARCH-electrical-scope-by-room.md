## A. KITCHEN RENOVATION ELECTRICAL

### A1. Power Circuits -- Dedicated Appliance Circuits

#### A1.1 Electric Oven
- **What it involves**: Hardwired connection from a dedicated circuit at the switchboard to the oven location. Includes an isolation switch within 2m of the appliance. Ovens rated over 3kW must be hardwired; ovens under 3kW can plug into a dedicated 15A GPO.
- **Circuit specifications**: Typically a 20A circuit breaker with 2.5mm TPS cable for ovens up to ~4.5kW. For larger double ovens (up to ~8kW), a 32A breaker with 6mm TPS cable may be required.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD -- present in virtually every kitchen renovation.
- **Compliance**: Must be connected to an RCD (safety switch). An isolation switch is mandatory (AS/NZS 3000:2018). Must be installed by a licensed electrician. A Certificate of Compliance for Electrical Work (CCEW) must be issued.
- **Common mistakes**: Homeowners buying an oven without checking the existing circuit capacity. Assuming a new oven will work on the old circuit without checking wattage. Forgetting the isolation switch requirement.

**Confidence: HIGH** -- sourced from multiple Australian electrician sites and AS/NZS 3000 references.

#### A1.2 Cooktop (Gas vs Induction -- Major Difference)

**Gas Cooktop with Electric Ignition:**
- **What it involves**: A standard 10A GPO located in the cupboard beside the cooktop for the igniter. Minimal electrical work.
- **Circuit specifications**: Standard 10A GPO on a shared or existing power circuit. Standard 2.5mm TPS cable. No dedicated circuit typically required.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD if gas is being retained.

**Induction Cooktop (or full electric cooktop):**
- **What it involves**: Hardwired connection to a dedicated high-amperage circuit. Requires an isolation switch within 2m of the cooktop (must not require reaching over the hot surface). This is the single biggest electrical change in modern kitchen renovations, particularly for homes switching from gas to electric.
- **Circuit specifications per AS/NZS 3000 Table C4 (with diversity)**:
  - Up to 5kW: 16A breaker
  - 5-8kW: 20A breaker
  - 8-10kW: 25A breaker
  - 10-13kW: 32A breaker (most common residential induction cooktops)
  - Over 13kW: 40A breaker
  - Cable: 6mm TPS for 32A circuits. 4mm TPS for 20A circuits. Cable size increases for longer runs.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD -- induction cooktops are now the default choice in new renovations.
- **Compliance**: Isolation switch mandatory within 2m (AS/NZS 3000 Clause 4.7). Must not be inside a cupboard or require reaching over the cooktop. RCD protection required. Exclusion zone of 150mm either side of cooktop -- no GPOs or switches in this zone, extending upward to the rangehood or ceiling/2.4m (AS/NZS 3000 Clause 4.7.3).
- **Common mistakes**: Not checking if the existing switchboard has capacity for a new 32A circuit. Assuming the old gas cooktop circuit can handle induction. Not allowing for the exclusion zone when planning GPO layout. Buying a cooktop before confirming circuit availability.

**Confidence: HIGH** -- confirmed across multiple Australian sources and Whirlpool forums.

#### A1.3 Dishwasher
- **What it involves**: A GPO (power outlet) positioned inside the adjacent cupboard or under the bench, accessible when the dishwasher is pulled out. Can be a standard 10A GPO, though a dedicated 15A GPO on its own circuit is best practice.
- **Circuit specifications**: Most dishwashers draw 10A or less and come with a standard 10A plug. Best practice is a 15A dedicated GPO (with larger earth pin) on a 20A circuit breaker with 2.5mm TPS cable. Can share a circuit with other kitchen GPOs if loading permits, but a dedicated circuit is strongly recommended.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Compliance**: RCD protection mandatory. GPO must be accessible (not blocked by the dishwasher). Must comply with water proximity rules (GPO can be next to fixed plumbing if the plumbing is permanent and sealed, per AS/NZS 3000).
- **Common mistakes**: Placing the GPO behind the dishwasher where it cannot be accessed. Not having a dedicated circuit, leading to tripping when multiple kitchen appliances run simultaneously.

---

#### A1.4 Refrigerator
- **What it involves**: A standard 10A GPO positioned behind or beside the fridge space. Should ideally be on its own circuit to prevent food loss if another circuit trips.
- **Circuit specifications**: Standard 10A GPO on a 20A circuit. 2.5mm TPS cable. Dedicated circuit recommended but not strictly required.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Compliance**: RCD protection required on new/modified circuits.
- **Common mistakes**: Not providing a dedicated circuit (if the fridge shares with other GPOs and one trips, food spoils). Placing the GPO where it is inaccessible behind the fridge. Not considering a separate RCBO (combined RCD/circuit breaker) to isolate the fridge from other circuits.

---

#### A1.5 Rangehood
- **What it involves**: Either a hardwired connection or a GPO (typically inside the cupboard above), depending on the rangehood model. Ducted rangehoods may draw more power than recirculating models. Includes an isolation switch.
- **Circuit specifications**: Most residential rangehoods draw 2-5A and can share a lighting circuit or GPO circuit. Larger commercial-style rangehoods may need a dedicated 10A or 15A circuit. Standard 2.5mm TPS cable.
- **Electrical differences -- Ducted vs Recirculating**:
  - **Ducted**: Same electrical requirements but additional consideration for the duct fan motor. May draw slightly more current. Exhaust must vent outside (not into roof cavity, per NCC).
  - **Recirculating**: Lower power draw (no external fan motor). Simpler electrical installation.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Compliance**: Isolation switch required. Must comply with the 150mm cooktop exclusion zone (GPO/switch must not be within 150mm either side of the cooktop). If gas cooktop underneath, must comply with NCC ventilation requirements.
- **Common mistakes**: Not planning the electrical connection point during rough-in. Not confirming whether the rangehood is hardwired or plug-in before the electrician visits.

---

#### A1.6 Microwave
- **What it involves**: A GPO for a benchtop microwave, or a GPO inside a microwave cupboard/niche for a built-in unit. May or may not need a dedicated circuit depending on wattage.
- **Circuit specifications**: Most microwaves draw 5-10A on a standard 10A GPO. High-powered microwaves (1200W+) should be on a dedicated circuit. Standard 2.5mm TPS cable.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Common mistakes**: Not providing a GPO inside the microwave niche during renovation. Sharing a circuit with other high-draw appliances causing nuisance tripping.

**Confidence: HIGH**

Sources: [KBDI](https://www.kbdi.org.au/blogs/selina-zwolsman/2024/11/05/power-outlets-in-australian-kitchens)

---

#### A1.7 Waste Disposal Unit (InSinkErator)
- **What it involves**: A GPO under the sink, typically controlled by a switch on the benchtop or wall. Some models are hardwired. A pneumatic air switch on the benchtop is common (no electrical wiring to the switch itself -- it uses air pressure).
- **Circuit specifications**: Most units draw 3-8A. Standard 10A GPO. Can share a circuit with other kitchen GPOs. 2.5mm TPS cable.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL -- not in every kitchen, but increasingly common.
- **Compliance**: Must be on an RCD-protected circuit. GPO under sink must be positioned to avoid water/leak exposure.
- **Common mistakes**: Forgetting to plan for the switched GPO or air switch during benchtop installation. Not having a GPO under the sink at all.

**Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH** -- primarily sourced from US standards adapted for Australian context; Australian-specific standards for waste disposal units are less explicitly documented.

---

### A2. General Purpose Outlets (GPOs) -- Kitchen Bench Power Points

- **What it involves**: Double GPOs positioned along the kitchen splashback/bench for small appliances (toaster, kettle, coffee machine, blender, etc.).
- **Typical specifications**:
  - **Height**: 150mm above benchtop surface (approximately 1050mm from finished floor level, depending on bench height). This is the standard placement.
  - **Quantity**: Minimum 4-6 double GPOs for a typical kitchen. Best practice is one double GPO per 600mm of usable bench space. Minimum one double GPO per bench run.
  - **Circuit**: Shared 20A circuit with 2.5mm TPS cable. One circuit can serve multiple GPOs but should not exceed 20A total load. Typically 2 kitchen GPO circuits in a standard renovation.
  - **Double vs Single**: Double GPOs are standard in Australian kitchens (two sockets per outlet plate).
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Compliance**:
  - RCD protection on all circuits.
  - GPOs must not be placed within 150mm either side of the cooktop (exclusion zone).
  - Distance from water: If the sink holds less than 45L, GPOs must be at least 150mm horizontally and 400mm vertically from the sink edge. If the sink holds more than 45L, GPOs must be 500mm horizontally and 1000mm vertically from the sink.
- **Common mistakes**: Not having enough GPOs (the number one complaint post-renovation). Placing GPOs too close to the cooktop exclusion zone. Not considering appliance garage/pantry GPOs. Not planning for appliances like coffee machines that are always plugged in.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### A3. Lighting

#### A3.1 Recessed Downlights (General Kitchen Lighting)
- **What it involves**: Supply and installation of LED downlights in the kitchen ceiling. Includes cable runs, cut-outs, drivers, and connection to a dimmer switch.
- **Specifications**:
  - **IC-4 rated**: Required when insulation is present in the ceiling. IC-4 means the fitting can be completely covered by any type of insulation without a gap. Both the light AND the driver must be IC-4 rated.
  - **Typical spacing**: 900mm-1200mm apart for general kitchen lighting. Closer spacing (600-900mm) for task areas above benchtops.
  - **Dimming**: Trailing-edge dimmer switches recommended for LED downlights. Check LED driver compatibility with dimmer. A dedicated lighting circuit for dimmable downlights is typical.
  - **Circuit**: 10A lighting circuit with 1.5mm TPS cable. One circuit can typically serve 10-15 LED downlights.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Common mistakes**: Not specifying IC-4 rated downlights (non-IC downlights require clearance from insulation, which creates thermal bridges). Using incompatible dimmer switches causing flickering. Not planning enough downlights over task areas.

**Confidence: HIGH**

#### A3.2 Pendant Light Rough-Ins (Over Kitchen Island)
- **What it involves**: During the rough-in stage (before plaster/ceiling is finished), the electrician runs cables to the pendant locations and leaves coils of cable in the ceiling cavity. The exact pendant positions are often not finalized until the island position is confirmed. Junction/ceiling boxes are installed during the fit-off stage (second fix).
- **Rough-in includes**: Running cable from the lighting circuit to the approximate pendant locations, leaving slack/coils for adjustment, installing switching (wall switch or dimmer), and marking positions for the builder/plasterer.
- **Specifications**: Standard 10A lighting circuit, 1.5mm TPS cable. Ceiling junction boxes must be rated to support the pendant weight (minimum 5kg for most residential pendants; heavier fixtures need additional support).
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but very common with kitchen islands.
- **Common mistakes**: Not planning pendant positions during rough-in (extremely expensive to add later). Not leaving enough cable slack for position adjustments. Not coordinating pendant location with the kitchen designer before the electrician does rough-in. Forgetting to specify how many pendants and whether they are individually switched or ganged.

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

#### A3.3 Under-Cabinet LED Strip Lighting
- **What it involves**: LED strip lighting mounted under the upper kitchen cabinets to illuminate the benchtop (task lighting). Requires a LED driver (transformer) that converts 240V mains to 12V or 24V DC.
- **Specifications**:
  - **Voltage**: 24V DC is preferred for most residential installations (allows longer runs with less voltage drop). 12V is acceptable for shorter runs.
  - **Driver location**: The LED driver is typically mounted inside the upper cabinet or in a concealed location. It connects to a 240V supply (either hardwired or via a GPO inside the cabinet). The driver must be accessible for maintenance.
  - **Switching**: Typically switched via a wall switch (same circuit as kitchen lighting) or an inline switch. Can be connected to a smart switch or dimmer.
  - **Circuit**: Can share the kitchen lighting circuit if loading permits. The 240V side is standard 1.5mm TPS on a 10A circuit.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD in modern kitchen renovations -- one of the most popular features.
- **Common mistakes**: Not planning the driver location during cabinet design. Not running a cable to the under-cabinet area during rough-in. Choosing 12V when the strip run is long (voltage drop causes uneven brightness). Not making the driver accessible for future replacement.

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

#### A3.4 In-Cabinet Lighting
- **What it involves**: LED lighting inside glass-front upper cabinets or pantry cabinets. Typically using low-voltage LED strip or puck lights.
- **Specifications**: Same as under-cabinet lighting (12V/24V DC via driver). Often triggered by a door switch (auto on/off with cabinet door). Can be integrated with under-cabinet LED driver.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL
- **Common mistakes**: Not planning a power source inside or near the cabinet during rough-in.

**Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**

### A4. Rangehood / Kitchen Exhaust Fan Wiring
(Covered in A1.5 above -- including isolation switch and ducted vs recirculating)

---

### A5. Switchboard Implications

- **What it involves**: A kitchen renovation typically requires adding multiple new circuits to the switchboard. This may trigger a switchboard upgrade if the existing board is full or uses outdated ceramic fuses.
- **Typical new circuits added in a kitchen renovation**:
  1. Oven dedicated circuit (20A or 32A)
  2. Cooktop dedicated circuit (32A for induction)
  3. Dishwasher dedicated circuit (20A)
  4. Kitchen GPO circuit #1 (20A)
  5. Kitchen GPO circuit #2 (20A)
  6. Kitchen lighting circuit (10A)
  7. Fridge dedicated circuit (20A) -- optional but recommended
  - **Total: 5-7 new circuits typical**
- **Switchboard upgrade triggers**:
  - Old ceramic fuse board (pre-1980s) -- always requires full upgrade.
  - No available spaces in the existing switchboard for new circuits.
  - No RCD/safety switch protection on existing circuits (AS/NZS 3000:2018 requires RCD protection on ALL final subcircuits in new domestic work).
  - Total load exceeding the main switch/service fuse capacity (typically 63A single phase for residential).
- **Standard or Optional**: Switchboard UPGRADE is common (perhaps 40-50% of kitchen renovations in older homes). Adding circuits is STANDARD.
- **Common mistakes**: Not budgeting for a switchboard upgrade. Not checking the switchboard capacity before starting the renovation. An upgrade can add $1,500-$3,000+ to the project.

### A6. Smart Home Provisions

#### A6.1 USB-C Integrated Outlets
- **What it involves**: Power points with built-in USB-A and/or USB-C charging ports. Replaces standard GPO faceplates.
- **Specifications**: Standard 10A GPO circuit. No additional wiring required beyond a standard GPO. Available from Clipsal, HPM, and others in Australian-certified versions.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but increasingly requested.

#### A6.2 Smart Switches
- **What it involves**: WiFi or Zigbee/Z-Wave enabled light switches. Most replace standard switches on existing wiring. Some require a neutral wire at the switch location (older Australian homes may only have active and loop wires at the switch).
- **Specifications**: Standard 10A lighting circuit. Neutral wire at switch location required for most smart switches. Standard 1.5mm TPS cable.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL
- **Common mistakes**: Not running neutral wires to switch locations during renovation (makes smart switch retrofitting difficult later).

#### A6.3 WiFi Access Point Pre-Wire
- **What it involves**: Running a CAT6/CAT6A Ethernet cable from a central network location (usually the home office or comms cupboard) to a ceiling location in the kitchen for a WiFi access point (WAP). Also running a 240V supply to the same location (or using Power over Ethernet).
- **Specifications**: CAT6A cable preferred. Must be fire-rated for in-wall use. Power over Ethernet (PoE) eliminates the need for a separate 240V supply.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but strongly recommended during renovation -- retrofitting is expensive.
- **Common mistakes**: Not doing it during the renovation when walls are open. Placing the WAP too close to a wall or in a corner rather than centrally.

## B. BATHROOM RENOVATION ELECTRICAL

### B1. Electrical Zones (CRITICAL)

This is the most important electrical concept in bathroom renovations. AS/NZS 3000:2018 defines four zones that determine what electrical equipment can be installed and where.

#### Zone 0 -- Inside the Bath/Shower Base
- **Dimensions**: The interior volume of the bathtub or shower base itself (where water collects).
- **What is allowed**: Only IPX7-rated fittings (suitable for temporary immersion), operating at a maximum of 12V (SELV -- Separated Extra Low Voltage). In practice, this means almost nothing is installed here except possibly an IP67/IP68 LED strip inside a shower niche at floor level.
- **What is NOT allowed**: No switches, no GPOs, no mains-voltage fittings.

#### Zone 1 -- Directly Above Bath/Shower
- **Dimensions**: The volume extending vertically from the rim of the bath or shower base (Zone 0) up to 2.25m above floor level. For showers, this zone extends in a 1.2m radius from the shower head plumbing connection point. This radius is reduced to 0.6m where a fixed shower screen is installed.
- **What is allowed**: Light fittings with a minimum IPX4 rating (IP44 or IP65 -- both comply). Heated towel rails rated IP44 or IP55 may be installed if hardwired (controller/switch must be in Zone 3). Exhaust fans with appropriate IP rating.
- **What is NOT allowed**: No switches, no GPOs, no mains-voltage socket outlets.
- **IP ratings**: Minimum IPX4 (domestic). IPX5 required for communal bathrooms.

#### Zone 2 -- Adjacent to Zone 1
- **Dimensions**: The volume extending 0.6m horizontally outward from Zone 1, up to 2.25m above floor level. For basins, Zone 2 is 150mm horizontally and 400mm vertically from the basin edge (if basin capacity is less than 45L).
- **What is allowed**: Light fittings with minimum IPX4 rating. Shaver sockets (with isolating transformer). GPOs are permitted only if they are: (a) inside a closed cupboard (e.g., vanity cabinet), AND (b) protected by a 30mA RCD.
- **What is NOT allowed**: Exposed GPOs.

#### Zone 3 -- Outside Zones 0, 1, 2
- **Dimensions**: Any area outside Zones 0, 1, and 2, up to 2.4m horizontally and 2.5m vertically from the floor.
- **What is allowed**: Switches (no IP rating required). GPOs (must be RCD protected at 30mA max). Light fittings (no minimum IP requirement, but sealed fittings recommended due to steam).
- **Practical note**: In many Australian bathrooms (particularly small ones), Zone 3 may be very limited or non-existent, making GPO and switch placement challenging.

**Confidence: HIGH** -- directly from AS/NZS 3000:2018 and multiple Australian electrical industry sources.

- **Specifications**: IP44 minimum if in Zone 2. Can be 240V or 12V/24V depending on fixture. Connected to bathroom lighting circuit.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD (some form of vanity lighting is almost always included).

#### B2.3 Shower Niche Lighting
- **What it involves**: LED strip lighting inside a recessed shower niche. This is inside Zone 1 (or potentially Zone 0 if at the base of the shower).
- **Specifications**:
  - Must be IP67 minimum (IP68 preferred for full water submersion protection).
  - Must be low voltage: 12V or 24V DC via an LED driver.
  - The LED driver must be located outside the bathroom zones (e.g., in the ceiling cavity or adjacent room).
  - Nano-coated or silicone-enclosed LED strips are common.
  - Connected to the bathroom lighting circuit via the LED driver.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but very popular in modern bathroom renovations.
- **Common mistakes**: Using non-waterproof LED strips. Locating the driver where it cannot be accessed for maintenance. Not sealing the strip ends properly.

### B3. Exhaust Fan

- **What it involves**: Ducted or recirculating exhaust fan for bathroom ventilation. Must be ducted to the exterior (not into the roof cavity) per NCC. Includes a timer switch.
- **Specifications**:
  - **NCC/BCA requirement**: For bathrooms without natural ventilation (no openable window), mechanical exhaust is mandatory.
  - **Extraction rate**: Minimum 25 litres/second for bathrooms (per NCC Part 10.6 / 3.8.5).
  - **Timer switch**: Must be interlocked with the bathroom light switch and include a run-on timer so the fan continues to operate for a minimum of 10 minutes after the light is switched off.
  - **Humidity sensor**: Optional but increasingly common. Automatically activates the fan when humidity rises above a threshold.
  - **Circuit**: Can share the bathroom lighting circuit if loading permits. Standard 10A circuit, 1.5mm TPS cable.
  - **IP rating**: If installed in Zone 1, must be minimum IPX4.
  - **Isolation switch**: Required, typically located outside the bathroom or in Zone 3.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD (mandatory per building code for bathrooms without natural ventilation).
- **Ducted vs recirculating**: Ducted to outside is required by NCC for new work. Recirculating fans are only used where ducting is physically impossible. Electrical requirements are similar.
- **Common mistakes**: Venting the exhaust into the roof cavity instead of outside (code violation and causes mould). Not including a timer function. Undersizing the fan for the bathroom volume. Not planning the duct route during design.

### B4. Heated Towel Rail

- **What it involves**: Electric heated towel rail mounted on the bathroom wall. Can be hardwired or plug-in.
- **Specifications**:
  - **Wattage**: Typically 40W-150W depending on size.
  - **IP rating**: Most electric heated towel rails are rated IP55, making them suitable for Zone 1 and Zone 2 when hardwired.
  - **Hardwired vs Plug-in**:
    - *Hardwired*: Can be installed in Zone 1 or Zone 2 (closer to the shower). The controller/switch must be in Zone 3. Requires a licensed electrician. Connected to a dedicated circuit or shared bathroom power circuit with RCD protection. This is the preferred option in modern renovations.
    - *Plug-in*: Requires a GPO in a compliant location (Zone 3, or Zone 2 inside a closed cupboard). Limited placement options in small bathrooms. Easier to install but more restrictive on location.
  - **Timer/switch options**: 24-hour timer, WiFi timer, manual on/off switch. Timer switch must be in Zone 3.
  - **Circuit**: Can share a bathroom power circuit. Dedicated circuit not typically required due to low wattage (most draw less than 1A).
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but extremely common in Australian bathroom renovations.
- **Common mistakes**: Choosing plug-in when there is no GPO in a compliant location. Not planning the wiring rough-in before tiling. Not including a timer switch (running 24/7 wastes energy).

- **Specifications**:
  - **Voltage**: 230V mains supply.
  - **Circuit**: Dedicated 20A circuit recommended. Must be RCD protected. 2.5mm TPS cable from switchboard to thermostat location.
  - **Thermostat**: Wall-mounted thermostat with in-floor temperature sensor. Maximum thermostat load is typically 16A (e.g., Thermogroup thermostats). If the system exceeds 16A, a contactor/relay is required.
  - **Floor sensor**: Installed in a flexible conduit between two heating cables (so it can be replaced without disturbing the floor if it fails).
  - **Cable vs Mat systems**:
    - *Cable systems*: More flexible for irregular-shaped rooms. Installed in a serpentine pattern over the floor. Spacing determines heat output.
    - *Mat systems*: Pre-spaced cable bonded to a mesh mat. Easier and faster to install. Best for regular rectangular areas. Available in standard sizes.
    - Electrically, both are identical -- same voltage, same circuit requirements, same thermostat compatibility.
  - **Typical draw**: A typical bathroom (3-5 sqm of heated area) draws 4-8A at 230V.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but very common in higher-end bathroom renovations.
- **Compliance**: Must be on an RCD-protected circuit. Must be commissioned and tested by a licensed electrician. Must comply with AS/NZS 3000.
- **Common mistakes**: Not installing the floor sensor in a conduit (making it irreplaceable if it fails). Cutting the heating cable (voids warranty and causes overheating). Not running the thermostat cable during rough-in. Not confirming switchboard capacity for the additional circuit.

### B6. Heat Lamp / 3-in-1 Bathroom Unit (IXL Tastic or Similar)

- **What it involves**: A combination ceiling-mounted unit providing heat (infrared lamps or fan-forced heater), light, and exhaust ventilation in one fixture. The IXL Tastic is the most well-known Australian brand.
- **Specifications**:
  - **Power draw**: Typically 1100W-2400W depending on model (heat lamps are 275W each, with 2-4 lamps per unit).
  - **Circuit**: Can be connected to a lighting or power circuit if loading permits. A dedicated 10A or 15A circuit is recommended for higher-wattage models. 2.5mm TPS cable.
  - **Switching**: Requires a 3-gang or 4-gang switch plate (separate switches for heat, light, and exhaust fan). Switch must be in Zone 3.
  - **Isolation switch**: May be required depending on the installation manual. Some models require a dedicated circuit with its own circuit breaker serving as the isolation device.
  - **IP rating**: Must comply with zone requirements. Most 3-in-1 units are designed for ceiling mounting in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL (but very common, particularly in cooler climate zones of Australia).
- **Compliance**: Must be located per AS/NZS 3000 damp situation requirements. Installation manual requirements must be followed.
- **Common mistakes**: Not providing enough switch positions on the wall plate. Not having a large enough ceiling cut-out. Not confirming circuit capacity before installation. Choosing a unit that is too large for the ceiling space.

- **Specifications**:
  - **Zone restrictions**:
    - Zone 0, 1: NO GPOs permitted.
    - Zone 2: Shaver sockets with isolating transformer only, OR GPOs inside a closed vanity cabinet with RCD protection.
    - Zone 3: Standard GPOs are permitted, must be RCD protected (30mA).
  - **Typical placement**: Inside the vanity cabinet, or on the wall adjacent to the vanity in Zone 3. Height approximately 1050mm from floor (just above benchtop).
  - **Circuit**: Standard 20A GPO circuit with 2.5mm TPS cable. RCD protection mandatory.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD (at least one GPO per bathroom).
- **Compliance**: RCD (30mA) protection is mandatory for all bathroom GPOs. Position must comply with zone requirements.
- **Common mistakes**: Placing a GPO in Zone 1 or Zone 2 (non-compliant). Not having a GPO at all in the bathroom (very inconvenient). Not checking if the bathroom has any Zone 3 space available for a GPO (very small bathrooms may not).

### B8. General Bathroom Electrical Compliance

#### B8.1 RCD Protection
- ALL bathroom circuits (lighting, power, exhaust, heated towel rail, underfloor heating) must be protected by an RCD rated at 30mA maximum.

#### B8.2 Equipotential Bonding
- **What it involves**: Bonding all conductive parts (metal pipes, metal bath frames, reinforcing steel in concrete floors/walls) to the electrical earthing system to prevent electric shock.
- **Specifications**: 4mm green/yellow insulated bonding conductor (per AS/NZS 3000 Clause 5.6.3.2(b)). Connected to the main earthing system at the switchboard.
- **What must be bonded**: Any conductive reinforcing within a concrete floor or wall of a room containing a shower or bath (Clause 5.6.2.5).
- **Standard or Optional**: MANDATORY per AS/NZS 3000 for all bathrooms with showers or baths.
- **Common mistakes**: This is one of the most commonly missed items in bathroom renovations. It must be done during the build stage (before tiling/concreting). Connecting to exposed slab reinforcing instead of the main earthing system is a common non-compliance. Missed bonding is a frequent inspection failure.

## C. LAUNDRY RENOVATION ELECTRICAL

### C1. Dedicated Circuits

#### C1.1 Washing Machine
- **What it involves**: A standard 10A GPO for the washing machine, positioned at an accessible location (not behind the machine).
- **Circuit specifications**: Most Australian washing machines have a standard 10A plug and draw 2-10A depending on the model and cycle (heating cycle draws the most). Standard 10A GPO on a 20A circuit. 2.5mm TPS cable.
- **Dedicated circuit**: Not strictly required by AS/NZS 3000 for most washing machines. Best practice is to have it on a circuit shared only with other laundry GPOs (not the rest of the house). Some self-heating washing machines may draw more than 10A and need assessment.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Common mistakes**: Placing the GPO behind the washing machine where it cannot be accessed for disconnection. Not having RCD protection on the circuit.

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

#### C1.2 Dryer
- **What it involves**: A dedicated GPO for the clothes dryer. Australian electric dryers typically have a 10A or 15A plug depending on wattage.
- **Circuit specifications**:
  - **Standard vented/condenser dryers**: Most Australian dryers (up to ~2400W) use a standard 10A plug. These can technically share a circuit but a dedicated GPO circuit is strongly recommended.
  - **Larger/heat-pump dryers**: Some high-powered dryers require a 15A plug with a dedicated 15A GPO on a 20A circuit with 2.5mm TPS cable. The 15A plug has a wider earth pin than a 10A plug.
  - NOTE: Australian dryers run on 240V single-phase (unlike US dryers which need 240V via two-phase). This means the circuit requirements are lower than US equivalents.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD if a dryer is planned.
- **Common mistakes**: Assuming a dryer can share a circuit with the washing machine (not recommended). Not checking whether the dryer needs a 10A or 15A socket before installation. Not having a dedicated circuit causes nuisance tripping.

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

#### C1.3 Second Fridge / Freezer
- **What it involves**: A GPO for a second fridge or standalone freezer, commonly located in the laundry.
- **Circuit specifications**: Standard 10A GPO. Dedicated circuit recommended (same reasoning as kitchen fridge -- prevents food loss if circuit trips). 20A circuit, 2.5mm TPS cable.
- **Standard or Optional**: OPTIONAL but very common in Australian homes.
- **Common mistakes**: Putting the second fridge on the same circuit as the dryer or washing machine.

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### C2. GPO Requirements

- **Quantity**: Minimum 2-3 double GPOs in a typical laundry (one for washing machine, one for dryer, one spare/general use). More for larger laundries.
- **Height**: Standard 300mm from finished floor level for appliance GPOs (or as appropriate for the specific appliance). Bench-height GPOs (1050mm) if the laundry has a bench/folding area.
- **Positioning**: GPOs behind large appliances should be accessible when the appliance is in place (offset to one side or at a height the plug can reach without pulling the machine fully out). The GPO should not be directly behind the machine where it is compressed against the wall.
- **Weatherproof requirements**: If the laundry is an external or semi-enclosed space (e.g., carport laundry, outdoor laundry), all GPOs must be weatherproof rated (minimum IP53, commonly IP54 or IP56). These require spring-loaded covers that close when not in use.
- **RCD protection**: Mandatory on all laundry circuits (AS/NZS 3000:2018).
- **Standard or Optional**: GPOs are STANDARD. Weatherproofing is CONDITIONAL on location.

---

### C3. Lighting

- **What it involves**: General ceiling light (surface-mounted or recessed downlight) for the laundry.
- **Specifications**: Standard 10A lighting circuit, 1.5mm TPS cable. If the laundry is considered a wet area (contains a tub/trough/basin), the same zone rules as bathrooms may apply around the water source, requiring IP-rated fittings within the relevant zones.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD
- **Common mistakes**: Not providing adequate lighting over the bench/sorting area. Not considering if the laundry has a tub (which creates wet area zones).

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### C4. Exhaust Fan

- **What it involves**: Mechanical exhaust ventilation for the laundry.
- **NCC/BCA requirement**: For laundries without natural ventilation (no openable window), mechanical exhaust is mandatory.
- **Extraction rate**: 20 litres per second (lower than bathroom requirement of 25 L/s).
- **Ducting**: Must discharge to outside (or into a ventilated roof space with compliant openings).
- **Circuit**: Can share the laundry lighting circuit. Standard 10A circuit, 1.5mm TPS cable.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD if no natural ventilation. OPTIONAL if the laundry has adequate natural ventilation (openable window of sufficient size).
- **Common mistakes**: Not ducting the exhaust to outside. Undersizing the fan.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### C5. Hot Water System (Gas to Electric Heat Pump Conversion)

- **What it involves**: When converting from a gas hot water system to an electric heat pump hot water system, a new electrical circuit must be run from the switchboard to the hot water system location. This is one of the most common "getting off gas" electrical upgrades.
- **Circuit specifications by brand**:
  - **Rheem Ambiheat**: 15A circuit, hardwired with 15A isolator switch.
  - **Sanden**: 20A circuit.
  - **Reclaim**: 15A circuit, hardwired with 15A isolator switch (actual draw ~10A).
  - **General**: Typically 15A or 20A dedicated circuit. 2.5mm TPS cable for 20A circuits. Must have its own circuit breaker at the switchboard. Must have an isolator switch at the unit.
- **Location**: Heat pump hot water systems are typically located outside, adjacent to the laundry or in the same location as the previous gas unit. The circuit runs from the switchboard to the outdoor location.
- **Standard or Optional**: STANDARD if converting gas to electric. N/A if retaining gas or existing electric.
- **Compliance**: Must be on its own circuit breaker. Hardwired with isolator switch. RCD protection required. Must follow the specific manufacturer's installation instructions per AS/NZS 3000.
- **Common mistakes**: Not budgeting for the new electrical circuit when planning the gas-to-electric conversion. Not confirming switchboard has capacity for the additional circuit. Not coordinating between the plumber (who installs the unit) and the electrician (who provides the power).

## NOTES ON CONFIDENCE AND LIMITATIONS

1. **Circuit breaker sizes and cable sizes** are sourced from Australian electrician websites and AS/NZS 3000 Table C4 references. These are standard industry values but the exact requirement for any specific installation depends on cable run length, installation method, ambient temperature, and grouping factors. A licensed electrician must make the final determination.

2. **Zone dimensions for bathrooms** are well-documented across multiple Australian sources and align consistently with AS/NZS 3000:2018.

3. **The cooktop exclusion zone** (150mm, Clause 4.7.3) was introduced in AS/NZS 3000:2018 and is well-documented.

4. **Heat pump hot water specifications** vary significantly by brand and model. The circuit sizes listed are representative of popular Australian brands but the specific manufacturer's installation manual must always be followed.

5. **Waste disposal unit** information was less well-documented in Australian-specific sources. The specifications provided are adapted from general practice and should be validated with the specific product manual.

6. All work described in this document must be performed by a licensed electrician in Australia. DIY electrical work is illegal in all Australian states and territories.
