## 1. The Engineered Stone Ban — What Homeowners Must Know

**Confidence: HIGH**

This is the single most important regulatory change affecting stone benchtops in Australia in the last decade. Many homeowners are still unaware of it, and it fundamentally changes what materials are available.

### What Happened

On 13 December 2023, WHS ministers unanimously agreed to ban engineered stone across Australia. The ban took effect on **1 July 2024** in all states and territories. On **1 January 2025**, engineered stone became a prohibited import under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956.

### Why It Was Banned

The ban is a response to the rise of **silicosis** — a serious, irreversible, and potentially fatal lung disease — among workers who cut, ground, or polished engineered stone. Modelling by Curtin University predicts up to 10,000 Australians will develop lung cancer, and 103,000 will develop silicosis, in their lifetime after inhaling silica dust from these products.

### What Is Banned

Engineered stone is defined as an artificial product that:
- Contains at least 1% crystalline silica (by weight/weight concentration)
- Is created by combining natural stone materials with other chemical constituents (water, resins, pigments)

This covers products previously sold as "quartz benchtops" or "reconstituted stone" — brands like Caesarstone, Silestone, and similar composite stone products.

### What Is NOT Banned

| Material | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Natural granite | Legal | No restrictions |
| Natural marble | Legal | No restrictions |
| Natural quartzite | Legal | No restrictions |
| Sintered stone (Dekton, Neolith, Lapitec, Asetica) | Legal | Does not contain resin; explicitly excluded from the ban |
| Porcelain slabs (large format) | Legal | Does not contain resin; explicitly excluded from the ban |
| Timber, laminate, concrete, stainless steel | Legal | Not stone products; unaffected |

### What Homeowners Need to Know

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Do I need to remove my existing engineered stone benchtop? | **No.** Existing installed benchtops are safe and do not need to be removed. The risk is during fabrication (cutting, grinding, polishing), not from living with the finished product. |
| Can I get my existing engineered stone benchtop repaired? | **It depends.** Any work that involves cutting, grinding, or polishing engineered stone is prohibited. Minor repairs that do not generate silica dust may be possible — check with your state regulator. |
| Can I buy engineered stone from overseas? | **No.** It is a prohibited import as of 1 January 2025. |
| What should I choose instead? | Natural stone (granite, marble, quartzite), sintered stone (Dekton, Neolith), or porcelain slabs are the main alternatives. Each has different maintenance, cost, and durability profiles. |

### Common Homeowner Mistake Related to the Ban

Many homeowners still search for "Caesarstone" or "quartz benchtops" because that is what they had in a previous kitchen, or what friends recommended. They may not realise these products are no longer available for new installations. Stone masons and kitchen companies should be informing customers, but some homeowners arrive at the templating stage still expecting engineered stone.

**What to do:** If a stone mason or kitchen company offers to install "engineered quartz" or a product that sounds like it might be a resin-bonded quartz composite, ask directly whether it complies with the engineered stone ban. If they cannot clearly explain the material's composition, that is a red flag.

## 2. Selection Mistakes

**Confidence: HIGH**

These are the most common errors homeowners make before a single piece of stone is cut.

### 2.1 Not Having Sink, Cooktop, and Taps Selected Before Template

**Impact: Project delays of 1-4 weeks. Potential re-fabrication costs.**

The stone mason cannot fabricate the benchtop until they know the exact make and model of:
- The sink (determines cut-out size, undermount vs top-mount, and overhang)
- The cooktop (determines cut-out size and clearances)
- The tap/mixer (determines hole size and position — minimum 35mm between sink and tap cut-outs)
- Any additional items: water filter tap, soap dispenser, pop-up power outlet

Templates are constructed to the exact size and shape of the finished stone product, with all appliance, sink, and tap hole locations indicated and cut into the template.

| Item | Why It Must Be Selected Before Template |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| Sink | Cut-out size varies by model; undermount vs top-mount changes edge finishing; minimum 80mm from front edge and 50mm from rear edge required |
| Cooktop | Cut-out dimensions are model-specific; some cooktops require specific clearances or support strips |
| Tap/mixer | Hole diameter varies (typically 32-35mm); position relative to sink must be specified |
| Water filter tap | Additional hole required; must be coordinated with sink position |

**What happens if you are not ready:** The template cannot be done. The stone mason leaves. You lose your place in the fabrication queue. Typical wait after template is 5-10 working days for fabrication — so a delayed template pushes your entire kitchen installation back by at least a week, and often more during busy periods.

### 2.2 Choosing Natural Stone Without Understanding Maintenance

**Impact: Ongoing frustration, staining, etching, and costly professional restoration.**

With engineered stone no longer available, many homeowners are turning to natural stone (particularly marble) for the first time. The maintenance profiles are very different from what they may be used to.

| Stone Type | Sealing Frequency | Acid Sensitivity | Scratch Resistance | Stain Risk | Maintenance Level |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Granite | Every 1-2 years | Low | High | Low-Medium | Low |
| Marble | Every 6-12 months | HIGH — etches on contact with acid | Low-Medium | HIGH | High |
| Quartzite | Every 1-2 years | Low-Medium | High | Low-Medium | Low-Medium |
| Sintered stone | No sealing required | None | Very High | Very Low | Very Low |
| Porcelain slab | No sealing required | None | High | Very Low | Very Low |

**The marble trap:** Marble is the most visually stunning option for many homeowners (Carrara, Calacatta), but it is also the most demanding. Marble has a calcium carbonate composition that reacts with any acid — lemon juice, vinegar, wine, tomato sauce — creating dull spots called "etches." These are not stains; they are chemical reactions that dissolve the surface. The only fix is professional mechanical grinding and re-polishing.

### 2.3 Not Understanding Join Placement

**Impact: Disappointment with visible seams; unrealistic expectations.**

Stone slabs are not infinitely large. Standard slab sizes mean that most kitchens — especially L-shaped, U-shaped, or island layouts — will require at least one join.

**Key facts homeowners often do not understand:**

- Joins are **unavoidable** in most kitchens. A typical slab is approximately 3000mm x 1400mm (varies by material). Any benchtop run longer than this, or any L-shaped/U-shaped layout, will have joins.
- A skilled stone mason can make joins near-invisible, but they will **never be completely invisible**. Under certain lighting conditions, joins will always be perceptible.
- Join visibility depends on the stone colour and pattern. Joins are **less noticeable on lighter, more uniform colours** and **more noticeable on heavily veined or dark stones**.
- Joins can discolour over time. On light-coloured benchtops, the resin in the join can yellow or trap dirt, making the join more visible with age.
- Some join positions are structurally necessary (e.g., behind a cooktop where a narrow strip connects two large sections).

### 2.4 Assuming Waterfall Ends Are Included in Base Price

**Impact: Budget blowout of $500-$2,000+ per waterfall end.**

A waterfall end (where the benchtop stone continues vertically down the side of a cabinet to the floor) is one of the most requested design features in modern kitchens. Homeowners frequently assume it is part of the benchtop price.

**What it actually costs:**

| Scenario | Additional Cost (Approx.) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Waterfall end — stone cut from leftover slab material | $500-$650 per waterfall |
| Waterfall end — requires additional slab purchase | $1,500-$2,500+ per waterfall |
| Mitre joint for waterfall connection | $150+ per joint |
| Vein matching for waterfall (premium service) | Additional cost on top of above |

The total cost depends heavily on whether there is enough leftover slab material after the main benchtop is cut. If the layout is efficient, one slab may yield both the top and the waterfall panel. If not, a second slab may be needed — which can double the material cost of that section.

**Vein matching matters:** For a premium finish, the vein pattern should flow continuously from the horizontal benchtop down the vertical waterfall. This requires careful slab cutting and significantly more material (because the mason must cut from specific positions on the slab to maintain the pattern). Poor vein alignment at a waterfall joint is very noticeable and a sign of careless fabrication.

### 2.5 Not Understanding 20mm vs 40mm (Laminated) Thickness Pricing

**Impact: Budget surprise of 30-50% on material and labour.**

Most stone benchtops are fabricated from 20mm thick slabs. However, many homeowners want the look of a chunky 40mm edge — which is achieved not by using a solid 40mm slab (extremely heavy and expensive) but by **laminating** a strip of the same stone to the underside of the edge, creating a 40mm "look."

| Thickness | How It Is Made | Typical Additional Cost |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| 20mm (standard) | Single slab, square or profiled edge | Base price |
| 40mm (laminated/mitred) | 20mm slab + additional strip mitred at 45 degrees and glued to the edge | $130-$500 per lineal metre of edging, depending on material and fabricator |
| Full 40mm slab | Solid 40mm slab (rare, very heavy) | Significantly more expensive; rarely used in residential |

**The cost shock:** On a standard kitchen with 5-6 lineal metres of benchtop edge, upgrading from 20mm to 40mm laminated can add **$650-$3,000** to the total cost. Some quotes show this as a lump sum ("40mm edging: $500 per slab"), others as a per-lineal-metre charge. Homeowners must ask for clarity.

### 2.6 Choosing the Cheapest Stone Without Considering Durability

**Impact: Premature staining, etching, or damage requiring professional repair or replacement.**

Not all stones perform equally in a kitchen environment. Some common pitfalls:

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Choosing a very light-coloured marble for a heavy-use kitchen | Staining from everyday cooking (oil, wine, sauce), etching from acidic foods, visible wear within months |
| Choosing the cheapest granite without checking porosity | Some budget granites are very porous and stain easily if not meticulously sealed |
| Choosing a honed (matte) finish on marble | Honed marble shows stains and etching MORE than polished marble, and is harder to restore |
| Selecting based on a small sample chip | Small samples do not show the full colour variation, veining patterns, or how the stone looks at kitchen scale |

**Best practice:** Always ask the stone supplier about the specific maintenance requirements of your chosen material. Ask them to be honest about staining and etching susceptibility. Request to see full slabs, not just small samples.

### 2.7 Not Budgeting for the Full Benchtop Cost

**Impact: Budget shock when the full quote arrives.**

Stone benchtops are one of the single largest individual costs in a kitchen renovation. Homeowners often budget based on per-square-metre material prices without accounting for all the additional costs.

**What actually makes up the total benchtop cost:**

| Cost Component | Typical Range |
|----------------|---------------|
| Stone material (per m2, supplied) | $500-$2,500/m2 depending on stone type |
| Fabrication and installation labour | $800-$2,500 depending on complexity |
| Template/measure | Often included, sometimes $150-$300 |
| Sink cut-out | $100-$250 each |
| Cooktop cut-out | $100-$250 each |
| Tap holes | $50-$80 each |
| Edge profiling (beyond standard square edge) | $30-$100+ per lineal metre |
| 40mm laminated edge (if applicable) | $130-$500 per lineal metre |
| Waterfall end (if applicable) | $500-$2,500 each |
| Splashback (if stone) | $200-$600+ per lineal metre |
| Demolition/removal of existing benchtop | $200-$600 |

**A realistic budget for a standard Australian kitchen (approx. 3-4m2 of benchtop):**
- Budget natural stone (granite): $2,500-$5,000 fully installed
- Mid-range natural stone (marble/quartzite): $4,000-$8,000 fully installed
- Premium natural stone or sintered stone with waterfall ends: $8,000-$15,000+ fully installed

### 2.8 Expecting Showroom Samples to Match Installed Slabs Exactly

**Impact: Disappointment after installation; disputes with supplier.**

Natural stone is a product of nature. No two slabs are identical. Even slabs cut from the same block will have variation in colour, veining, and pattern density.

Common misunderstandings:
- A 100mm x 100mm sample chip cannot represent the full range of variation in a 3000mm x 1400mm slab
- Lighting in a showroom is different from lighting in a kitchen — the stone will look different in situ
- Photos (including on supplier websites) do not accurately capture depth, sparkle, or how lighting affects the surface
- Even engineered alternatives like sintered stone can have variation between batches (though less than natural stone)

### 2.9 Not Viewing Actual Slabs in Person

**Impact: Receiving a stone that looks different from expectations.**

For natural stone in particular, homeowners should visit the supplier's slab yard or showroom and personally select the specific slab(s) that will be used for their benchtop. Suppliers track slabs by block number and slab number. Choosing "Carrara marble" without selecting a specific slab means the supplier will choose for you — and their choice may not match your vision.

## 3. Red Flags When Choosing a Stone Mason

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Red Flag | Why It Is a Problem |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Demands full payment upfront** | Industry standard is a deposit (typically 30-50%) with the balance on completion. Full upfront payment removes your leverage if work is substandard. |
| **Cash-only payment** | May indicate uninsured or unlicensed operation. No paper trail for warranty claims or disputes. |
| **No written quote or contract** | You have no legal protection if costs change, scope changes, or work is defective. |
| **Vague or lump-sum quote with no breakdown** | You cannot assess whether costs are reasonable. Reputable stone masons provide line-item breakdowns (material, fabrication, cut-outs, edge profiles, installation). |
| **Cannot or will not show a portfolio of previous work** | An experienced stone mason should have dozens of completed projects to show. No portfolio suggests inexperience or poor quality they do not want you to see. |
| **Will not provide references** | Similar to above. A reputable mason should be happy for you to speak with past clients. |
| **Significantly cheaper than all other quotes** | If one quote is 30-40% below others, they are either cutting corners on material quality, using thinner stone, or planning to charge extras later. |
| **Promises unrealistically fast turnaround** | Quality stone fabrication takes time. A standard kitchen benchtop typically takes 5-10 working days after template. Promising 2-3 days suggests corners being cut. |
| **No mention of template/measure** | Fabricating without a proper on-site template (or laser measure) is a recipe for ill-fitting benchtops. |
| **No insurance or refuses to provide proof** | Public liability and product liability insurance should be current. Ask to see the certificate. |
| **Does not ask about your sink, cooktop, or taps** | A professional stone mason will insist these are selected before proceeding. One who does not ask is likely to fabricate incorrectly or charge for re-fabrication. |
| **Offers to install engineered stone "under the table"** | This is illegal across Australia as of 1 July 2024. It is also dangerous to the workers involved. Walk away immediately. |
| **No warranty offered in writing** | Even a 12-month workmanship warranty should be documented. Verbal promises are unenforceable. |

### What a Good Stone Mason Looks Like

- Provides a detailed, itemised written quote
- Insists on a proper on-site template (laser or physical)
- Asks what sink, cooktop, taps, and other fixtures you have selected
- Can explain the difference between stone types and advise on suitability
- Shows a portfolio and provides references
- Carries current public liability insurance
- Provides a written warranty (typically 12 months on workmanship)
- Is transparent about join placement and discusses it with you before fabrication
- Does not demand full payment upfront

## 4. Common Disputes Between Homeowners and Stone Masons

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (disputes are highly variable and fact-specific)

Based on Australian forum discussions, Fair Trading complaints, and tribunal records, these are the most common areas of dispute:

### 4.1 Join Quality and Visibility

**The dispute:** Homeowner expected "invisible" joins; the installed joins are visible, uneven, or have discoloured.

**The reality:** Joins will always be present in most kitchens. The quality of the join depends on the stone mason's skill. A good join should be:
- Flush (no step between the two pieces)
- Colour-matched with tinted epoxy
- Tight (no visible gap)
- Positioned in the least noticeable location

**When to escalate:** If the join has a visible step (one side higher than the other), a gap of more than 0.5mm, or the colour match is clearly wrong, this is defective work and should be raised as a warranty claim.

### 4.2 Cracks Around Cut-Outs

**The dispute:** Cracks develop near sink or cooktop cut-outs within weeks or months of installation.

**Common causes:**
- Internal corners of cut-outs were left as sharp 90-degree angles instead of being radiused (rounded)
- Insufficient support under the benchtop near cut-outs
- Thermal shock from hot cookware placed near unsupported areas
- Stone defects (natural fissures near the cut-out)

**Who is responsible:** If cracks appear within the warranty period and are near cut-outs, the stone mason's workmanship is usually at fault (improper corner relief or inadequate support). If cracks appear due to external impact or thermal shock, this is typically the homeowner's responsibility.

### 4.3 Poor Support and Flexing

**The dispute:** The benchtop flexes, moves, or cracks because the underlying cabinets are not level or there is inadequate support.

**Real-world examples from Australian forums:** Homeowners have reported stone masons using scrap timber as packers, benchtops not sitting flat on cabinets, and breakfast bar overhangs flexing when leaned on.

**Industry standard:** Any overhang exceeding 200mm requires structural support (typically 10mm thick, 70mm wide steel bar fixed underneath, or proprietary brackets). The stone mason should inspect the cabinets before template and refuse to proceed if they are not level and adequately constructed.

### 4.4 Measurement and Fit Errors

**The dispute:** Benchtop does not fit correctly — too long, too short, wrong cut-out position, or gaps against walls.

**Prevention:** A proper on-site template (physical MDF template or laser measure) should prevent these errors. If the stone mason fabricates from plans only (without a physical template), the risk of errors increases significantly.

### 4.5 Colour Mismatch with Expectations

**The dispute:** The installed stone does not match what the homeowner expected based on samples or photos.

**Prevention:** For natural stone, always select the specific slab in person. For sintered/porcelain, request a large-format sample and check it in your kitchen lighting. Most suppliers' warranty terms explicitly exclude claims based on "colour, edging styles, or other opinions based on personal preference" after installation.

### 4.6 Damage During Installation

**The dispute:** Chips, cracks, or scratches caused during delivery and installation of the benchtop.

**Prevention:** Inspect the benchtop thoroughly upon installation. Failure to inspect and note defects at the time of installation may be treated as acceptance of the product under many suppliers' terms and conditions.

### Dispute Resolution in Australia

| State | Body | Contact |
|-------|------|---------|
| NSW | NSW Fair Trading, then NCAT | fairtrading.nsw.gov.au / 13 32 20 |
| VIC | Consumer Affairs Victoria, then VCAT | consumer.vic.gov.au |
| QLD | Office of Fair Trading, then QCAT | qld.gov.au/law/fair-trading |
| SA | Consumer and Business Services | cbs.sa.gov.au |
| WA | Consumer Protection WA | commerce.wa.gov.au |

**Time limits:** In NSW, for major defects you have 6 years from completion; for all other defects, 2 years from completion. Similar statutory warranties apply in other states under Australian Consumer Law.

**Claims under $30,000** can typically be heard by the relevant tribunal without the need for a lawyer, making it accessible and relatively low-cost for homeowners.

---

## 5. Things That Void Warranties

**Confidence: HIGH** (based on published warranty terms from multiple Australian stone suppliers)

Based on a review of warranty documents from multiple Australian stone fabricators and suppliers, the following are common exclusions and conditions that void warranty coverage:

### Fabricator/Installer Workmanship Warranty (Typically 12 Months)

| Action That Voids Warranty | Explanation |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Using the stone outdoors (unless specified as outdoor-rated) | UV exposure can cause fading, warping, and colour changes in many stone products. Outdoor use voids most manufacturer warranties. |
| Standing, sitting, or placing excessive weight on the benchtop | Stone benchtops are designed for normal kitchen use, not as structural supports. Concentrated heavy loads (standing on the benchtop to reach a high shelf) can cause cracking. |
| Impact damage (dropping heavy objects) | Chips and cracks from impacts are considered user damage, not defects. |
| Thermal shock (placing very hot items directly on the stone) | Placing a hot pan from the oven directly onto stone can cause thermal cracking. Always use trivets. This applies to ALL stone types including granite and sintered stone. |
| Failure to maintain sealant (natural stone) | If natural stone is not re-sealed at the recommended intervals (every 6-12 months for marble, 1-2 years for granite), staining that occurs is not covered. |
| Using acidic, abrasive, or harsh chemical cleaners | Vinegar, citrus-based cleaners, bleach, scouring creams, and abrasive pads can etch, dull, or scratch stone surfaces. Damage from these products is not covered. |
| Structural movement of the building | If the supporting cabinetry settles, shifts, or the building structure moves, causing the benchtop to crack, this is not covered by the stone mason's warranty. |
| Modifications by third parties | If another tradesperson (e.g., plumber) cuts, drills, or modifies the benchtop without the original fabricator's involvement, the warranty is voided. |
| Failure to inspect at installation | Some terms and conditions state that failure to inspect and note defects at the time of installation constitutes acceptance of the product. |

### Natural Stone Supplier Warranty

**Important:** Many natural stone suppliers provide **no formal warranty at all** on the stone material itself. Natural stone carries no manufacturer's warranty due to its natural origins. Warranty, where it exists, typically covers fabrication workmanship only.

Natural characteristics that are explicitly **not considered defects** and are **not covered:**
- Colour, pattern, grain, and density variations
- Natural markings, veining, cracks, and pitting
- Filled pits, voids, and natural fissures (resin-filled during processing)
- UV-resistant resin filling that may fade or loosen over time
- Variations in light reflection due to mineral composition
- Slab thickness tolerance of +/-2mm for 20mm slabs

### Sintered Stone / Porcelain Warranty

Sintered stone and porcelain products typically offer longer warranties (some up to 10-25 years) because they are manufactured products with more consistent properties. However, these warranties are usually:
- **Non-transferable** (do not transfer to new homeowners if you sell the property)
- Limited to the original purchaser
- Subject to the same exclusions for impact, thermal shock, and improper maintenance

## 6. Maintenance Mistakes After Installation

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Cleaning Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Is a Problem | What to Do Instead |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Using vinegar or citrus-based cleaners on marble/limestone | Acid reacts with calcium carbonate, causing permanent etching (dull spots) that cannot be wiped away | Use pH-neutral stone cleaner or mild dish soap with warm water |
| Using abrasive scouring pads or cream cleansers (Jif, Ajax) | Scratches the stone surface, strips any protective sealant | Use a soft cloth or microfibre |
| Using bleach or ammonia-based cleaners | Can discolour stone and strip sealant | Use products specifically formulated for stone |
| Over-applying soap or cleaner | Causes streaking and builds up a residue film over time | Use a small amount, rinse with clean water, dry with a soft cloth |
| Using generic "kitchen spray" cleaners | Many contain acids, solvents, or abrasives that damage stone | Check the label for "safe for natural stone" or buy a dedicated stone cleaner |

### Sealing Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Never re-sealing after the initial seal wears off | Natural stone becomes vulnerable to staining. Oil, wine, and coloured liquids can penetrate the surface permanently. |
| Not testing whether the seal is still effective | The seal degrades gradually. Test by sprinkling water on the surface — if it soaks in within a few minutes, re-sealing is needed. |
| Assuming sintered stone or porcelain needs sealing | These materials do not require sealing. Applying sealant to them is unnecessary and can leave a residue. |
| Applying sealant to a dirty surface | Sealant locks in existing dirt and stains. The surface must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before sealing. |
| Not sealing all surfaces including edges and underside | Unsealed edges can absorb moisture, especially around sink areas. |

### Usage Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Placing hot pots/pans directly on the surface | Risk of thermal shock cracking, especially near cut-outs or joins. Use trivets — always. |
| Cutting food directly on the surface | Knife marks will scratch polished stone. Always use a chopping board. |
| Leaving spills (especially acidic) sitting on marble | Even 5-10 minutes of contact with lemon juice or wine can cause visible etching on marble |
| Not wiping up oil spills quickly on porous stone | Oil can penetrate the pores and create dark stains that require professional poultice treatment to extract |
| Using the benchtop edge as a lever (prying open jars, bottles) | Can cause chipping, especially on mitred (40mm laminated) edges where the join is at the edge |

## 7. Misunderstandings About Natural Stone

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Marble

| Myth / Misunderstanding | Reality |
|-------------------------|---------|
| "Marble is the gold standard for kitchens" | Marble is stunning but is the **most high-maintenance** stone you can put in a kitchen. It is soft, porous, and acid-sensitive. It is best suited to bathrooms, vanities, or light-use areas — not heavy-use cooking kitchens. |
| "Sealing makes marble stain-proof" | Sealing slows stain penetration but does **not** make marble stain-proof. It buys you time to wipe up spills. Acidic liquids will still etch the surface even through a seal, because etching is a chemical reaction, not a stain. |
| "Etching and staining are the same thing" | **They are not.** Staining is when a coloured liquid penetrates the pores (can sometimes be removed with a poultice). Etching is when acid dissolves the stone surface, leaving a dull mark (can only be fixed by mechanical grinding and re-polishing). |
| "Honed (matte) marble is more practical" | Honed marble actually shows stains and etching **more** than polished marble, because the matte surface makes dull spots more noticeable. It is also slightly more porous. |
| "White marble stays white" | Over time, marble will develop a patina. Oil stains can create dark patches. Yellow/brown discolouration can occur from iron oxidation within the stone. Some homeowners embrace this as "character"; others find it unacceptable. |
| "Professional restoration can fix anything" | Mechanical grinding and re-polishing can fix etching, but it removes a thin layer of stone each time. Repeated restoration over many years will eventually change the stone's surface profile. Deep stains may not be fully removable. |

### Granite

| Myth / Misunderstanding | Reality |
|-------------------------|---------|
| "Granite is maintenance-free" | Granite is LOW maintenance, not NO maintenance. It still requires sealing every 1-2 years and should not be exposed to harsh chemicals. |
| "Granite is indestructible" | Granite is very hard but can still chip (especially at edges), crack (from impact or thermal shock), and stain (if unsealed). |
| "All granite looks the same" | Granite varies enormously — from near-uniform to wildly veined. Some granites are quite porous; others are very dense. The maintenance profile varies accordingly. |
| "Granite is outdated" | Granite has seen a resurgence since the engineered stone ban. It remains one of the most durable and practical natural stone options for kitchens. |

### Sintered Stone and Porcelain

| Myth / Misunderstanding | Reality |
|-------------------------|---------|
| "Sintered stone is just expensive tile" | Sintered stone is manufactured at much higher temperatures and pressures than standard porcelain tile, producing a denser, harder surface. However, large-format porcelain slabs are very similar in performance. |
| "Sintered stone is completely indestructible" | Sintered stone is extremely hard but can chip on edges (especially thin 12mm profiles) and crack from heavy point impacts. It is **not** bulletproof. |
| "You can put anything hot on sintered stone" | While sintered stone is rated to withstand very high temperatures, thermal shock (sudden extreme temperature change) can still cause cracking. The risk is low but not zero. |
| "Sintered stone looks like cheap imitation" | Modern sintered stone and porcelain slabs can be virtually indistinguishable from natural marble and granite. The technology has improved dramatically. |

---

## 8. Unrealistic Expectations — Colour, Veins, and Joins

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Colour Matching

| Expectation | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "My benchtop will look exactly like the sample" | Natural stone samples represent only a tiny fraction of the slab. Colour, veining, and pattern will vary significantly across the full slab. Even sintered stone can vary between production batches. |
| "The stone will match the photo on the supplier's website" | Photos do not capture a stone's true depth, sparkle, or how different lighting affects its appearance. Always view stone in person before committing. |
| "The two sides of my L-shaped benchtop will be an identical colour" | If cut from different slabs (or even different areas of the same slab), there will be variation. A skilled fabricator will select and orient pieces to minimise visible differences, but perfect colour matching is not always possible. |
| "If I need a replacement piece in 5 years, it will match" | Natural stone varies between quarry batches. Even the same quarry can produce different-looking stone over time. Engineered alternatives (sintered stone, porcelain) also change between production runs. Exact matching years later is very difficult. |

### Vein Matching

| Expectation | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "The veins will flow continuously around corners and waterfall ends" | This is possible with bookmatching (cutting the slab to mirror the pattern) but requires more material, more planning, and more cost. It must be specifically requested and quoted. |
| "Vein matching is standard" | It is not. Standard fabrication cuts for efficiency, not pattern continuity. Vein-matched waterfall ends and splashbacks are a premium service. |
| "The veins on my splashback will line up with the benchtop" | This is achievable with bookmatching from the same slab but adds significant cost and requires selecting a slab large enough to yield both pieces with continuous veining. |

### Join Visibility

| Expectation | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| "I was told the joins would be invisible" | No join is truly invisible. A well-made join can be very hard to see under normal conditions, but it will always be detectable if you look closely or under certain lighting angles. |
| "Joins should not be felt when running your hand across" | A quality join should be flush and smooth to the touch. If you can feel a step or ridge, the join quality is poor and should be raised with the stone mason. |
| "Light-coloured stones will have less visible joins" | Generally true — lighter, more uniform stones hide joins better than heavily veined or dark stones. |
| "Joins will stay looking good forever" | Join compound can discolour over time. On light benchtops, joins may yellow. On any benchtop, trapped dirt at the join line can become visible. Regular cleaning helps, but some discolouration is normal with age. |

## 9. Summary Checklist — Mistakes to Avoid

**Before You Choose a Stone:**
- [ ] Understand that engineered quartz stone is banned in Australia (since 1 July 2024)
- [ ] Research the maintenance requirements of your chosen stone type BEFORE committing
- [ ] View the actual slab in person (not just samples or photos)
- [ ] Budget for the FULL cost — material, fabrication, cut-outs, edge profiles, waterfall ends, installation, and removal of existing benchtop
- [ ] Understand that 40mm thickness is typically a laminated edge (not solid) and costs 30-50% more
- [ ] Ask about join placement and accept that joins will be visible (especially in dark or veined stones)

**Before Template Day:**
- [ ] Have your sink selected and on-site (or at least the exact make/model confirmed)
- [ ] Have your cooktop selected and on-site (or exact make/model confirmed)
- [ ] Have your tap/mixer and any additional taps (water filter) selected
- [ ] Ensure all cabinetry is installed and level

**When Choosing a Stone Mason:**
- [ ] Get a detailed, itemised written quote
- [ ] Ask to see a portfolio and speak to references
- [ ] Ask for proof of current public liability insurance
- [ ] Confirm they will do a proper on-site template (not fabricate from plans alone)
- [ ] Ensure the contract includes a written warranty (minimum 12 months workmanship)
- [ ] Never pay in full upfront — standard is 30-50% deposit, balance on completion
- [ ] Be cautious of quotes that are drastically cheaper than the competition

**At Installation:**
- [ ] Inspect the benchtop thoroughly before signing off
- [ ] Check join quality (flush, colour-matched, tight)
- [ ] Check cut-out edges (smooth, radiused corners, no chips)
- [ ] Check overall fit against walls and cabinets
- [ ] Note any defects in writing immediately — failure to inspect may constitute acceptance

**After Installation:**
- [ ] Seal natural stone immediately if not pre-sealed (and re-seal on schedule)
- [ ] Use only pH-neutral or stone-specific cleaning products
- [ ] Always use trivets for hot pans — on ALL stone types
- [ ] Always use chopping boards — on ALL stone types
- [ ] Wipe up acidic spills immediately (especially on marble)
- [ ] Never use vinegar, citrus cleaners, bleach, or abrasive pads
