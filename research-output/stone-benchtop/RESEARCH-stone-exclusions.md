## 1. Important Context: The Engineered Stone Ban

**Confidence: HIGH**

From 1 July 2024, Australia banned the use, supply, and manufacture of engineered stone benchtops, panels, and slabs nationally. From 1 January 2025, importation was also banned. This means:

- **Caesarstone, Silestone, Essastone, Smartstone** (and similar quartz-based products) can no longer be installed in new projects
- **Not affected:** Natural stone (granite, marble, quartzite), sintered stone (Dekton, Neolith), porcelain slabs, solid surface (Corian), laminate, timber, concrete, stainless steel
- **Existing installations** are safe and do not need removal. Minor modifications to existing engineered stone are still permitted under controlled conditions

This research covers exclusions applicable to all currently legal stone benchtop materials, with material-specific notes where they differ.

---

## 2. What IS Typically Included in a Stone Benchtop Quote

Before detailing exclusions, it is important to understand the baseline. A standard installed stone benchtop quote in Australia typically includes:

| Included Item | Notes |
|--------------|-------|
| Stone material (slab) | Supply of the selected stone |
| Templating / site measure | Laser or physical template of cabinets |
| Fabrication | Cutting, shaping, and polishing the stone to template |
| Standard edge profile | Usually a pencil round or eased edge at 20mm thickness |
| Standard sink cut-out (x1) | Typically one undermount or top-mount sink cut-out |
| Standard cooktop cut-out (x1) | One standard cooktop opening |
| Delivery to site | Within a defined metro radius |
| Installation / fitting | Placement and adhesive fixing onto cabinets |
| Standard joins | Where slab size requires joins in the benchtop |
| Basic silicone perimeter seal | Where benchtop meets walls |

**Key caveat:** "Installed" vs "supply only" quotes differ significantly. Always confirm whether the quote is supply-only, supply + fabrication, or fully installed (supply + fabrication + installation).

---

## 3. Standard Exclusions — Items NOT Included

### 3.1 Fixtures & Fittings (Owner-Selected Items)

**Confidence: HIGH**

These items are almost universally excluded from stone benchtop quotes because they are owner-selected and owner-purchased:

| Excluded Item | Why Excluded | Who Provides |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Sink** | Homeowner selects based on preference and budget | Homeowner purchases; must be on-site before template |
| **Tapware / mixer** | Homeowner selects style, finish, brand | Homeowner purchases; plumber installs |
| **Cooktop / hotplate** | Homeowner selects; varies by brand/model | Homeowner purchases; must be on-site before template |
| **Soap dispenser** | Optional accessory | Homeowner purchases if desired |
| **Filtered water tap** | Optional accessory requiring additional hole | Homeowner purchases; plumber installs |
| **Pop-up power outlets** | Electrical fitting; requires licensed electrician | Homeowner purchases; electrician installs |

**Critical requirement:** Sinks and cooktops must be on-site and available on template day so the stone mason can measure exact cut-out dimensions and positions. If appliances are not available, templating cannot proceed accurately.

---

### 3.2 Licensed Trade Work

**Confidence: HIGH**

Stone masons are not licensed plumbers or electricians. The following work requires separate licensed trades and is always excluded from a stone benchtop quote:

| Excluded Work | Required Trade | Typical Cost Range | Timing |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Plumbing disconnection** (existing sink, dishwasher) | Licensed plumber | $200 - $600 | Before old benchtop removal |
| **Plumbing reconnection** (sink, dishwasher, waste) | Licensed plumber | $300 - $800 | Minimum 24-48 hours after stone installation (adhesive cure time) |
| **Gas disconnection** (if gas cooktop) | Licensed gas fitter / plumber | $150 - $400 | Before old benchtop removal |
| **Gas reconnection** | Licensed gas fitter / plumber | $200 - $500 | After stone installation |
| **Electrical disconnection** (cooktop, rangehood, power points) | Licensed electrician | $150 - $400 | Before old benchtop removal |
| **Electrical reconnection** (cooktop hardwiring, power points) | Licensed electrician | $200 - $600 | After stone installation |

**Important note:** Some stone benchtop companies offer a bundled service where they coordinate a plumber to attend on installation day. This is a convenience add-on, not a standard inclusion. Always confirm whether it is included or an additional charge.

Total plumbing + electrical coordination typically adds **$400 - $1,200** to the overall project cost beyond the stone benchtop quote.

---

### 3.3 Cabinet & Structural Work

**Confidence: HIGH**

The stone mason's quote assumes cabinets are ready, level, and structurally sound. Any work to achieve this is excluded:

| Excluded Work | Why | Who Is Responsible |
|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| **Cabinet levelling** | Cabinets must be within 3mm flat and level over a 3m span; out-of-level cabinets cause stress cracks in stone | Cabinet maker / carpenter |
| **Cabinet securing to walls/floor** | All cabinets must be permanently fixed before template | Cabinet maker / carpenter |
| **Cabinet modifications** | Adjusting cabinet height, depth, or configuration to suit stone | Cabinet maker / carpenter |
| **Island bench securing to floor** | Free-standing islands must be firmly anchored | Cabinet maker / carpenter |
| **Substrate / template supply** | Typically 18mm MDF substrate provided and cut by cabinet maker | Cabinet maker |
| **Substrate cut-outs** | Pre-cutting substrate for sink, cooktop, etc. | Cabinet maker |
| **Support rails** | Along edges adjacent to sinks, ovens, and dishwashers | Cabinet maker |

**Why this matters:** If cabinets are not level and the stone cracks after installation, the stone mason's warranty will not cover it. The cabinet maker bears responsibility for providing a level, secure base.

---

### 3.4 Splashback Work

**Confidence: HIGH**

Splashback treatment is one of the most common areas of confusion:

| Scenario | Included in Stone Quote? | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|-------|
| **No splashback** (paint/tile behind) | N/A | Stone mason provides silicone seal to wall only |
| **Stone splashback (matching material)** | Sometimes — varies by supplier | Often quoted as an add-on or separate line item. Some masons include a standard 100mm upstand; full-height splashback is always extra |
| **Glass splashback** | Never included | Separate trade (glazier), measured after stone installation |
| **Tile splashback** | Never included | Separate trade (tiler), typically done after stone installation |
| **Existing splashback removal** | Rarely included | May require plasterer to repair wall behind |
| **Splashback repair/paint touch-up** | Never included | Painter's scope after old splashback/benchtop removal |

**Common misconception:** Homeowners often assume a matching stone splashback is included because it is the same material. In most cases, it is a separate quoted item with its own per-metre cost for material, fabrication, and installation.

A standard **100mm stone upstand** (a small lip where benchtop meets wall) is sometimes included as standard, but full-height splashbacks (typically 450-600mm between benchtop and overhead cabinets) are always additional.

---

### 3.5 Old Benchtop Removal & Disposal

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — varies significantly between suppliers

| Item | Typically Included? | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Removal of old benchtop** | Sometimes — check quote | Some suppliers include basic removal; others charge $350 - $800 extra |
| **Disposal / tip fees** | Usually excluded | Especially for heavy stone (granite, marble) — can be $200 - $400 |
| **Removal of old splashback** | Excluded | Often damages the wall behind; plasterer needed after |
| **Removal of old sink/tapware** | Excluded | Plumber's responsibility |
| **Asbestos-containing material removal** | Always excluded | Requires licensed asbestos removalist if present in older homes |

**Important:** When an old stone benchtop is removed, the wall area behind the splashback is frequently damaged. This repair work (plastering, painting) is never included in the stone benchtop scope and catches many homeowners by surprise.

---

### 3.6 Additional Cut-Outs Beyond Standard

**Confidence: HIGH**

Most quotes include one sink cut-out and one cooktop cut-out as standard. Additional or non-standard cut-outs are charged extra:

| Additional Cut-Out | Typical Extra Cost | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Second sink cut-out** (e.g., prep sink) | $250 - $400 | Common in island benches |
| **Soap dispenser hole** | $50 - $150 | Small diameter hole; not always listed on quote |
| **Filtered water tap hole** | $50 - $150 | Additional to standard mixer tap hole |
| **Pop-up power outlet cut-out** | $100 - $250 | Requires precise dimensions |
| **Undermount sink polishing** | $200 - $400+ extra vs top-mount | Interior edge of cut-out must be polished for undermount sinks |
| **Rebated/flush-mount cooktop cut-out** | $100 - $300 extra vs standard | Requires a rebate (step) cut into the stone surface |
| **Drainage grooves** | $150 - $350 | Channels cut into stone near sink; limited depth depending on material |

**Rule of thumb:** Any hole, cut-out, or modification beyond a standard top-mount sink and standard cooktop opening will attract an additional charge. Always specify every required cut-out at quoting stage to avoid surprises.

---

### 3.7 Sealing (Material-Dependent)

**Confidence: HIGH**

Sealing requirements vary dramatically by material type:

| Material | Sealing Required? | Initial Seal Included in Quote? | Ongoing Sealing |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **Granite** | Yes | Usually included (initial seal) | Every 1-2 years by homeowner or professional |
| **Marble** | Yes — critical | Usually included (initial seal) | Every 6-12 months; marble is highly porous |
| **Quartzite** | Yes | Usually included (initial seal) | Every 1-2 years |
| **Sintered stone** (Dekton, Neolith) | No — non-porous | N/A | No sealing required |
| **Porcelain slabs** | No — non-porous | N/A | No sealing required |
| **Engineered stone** (legacy) | No — non-porous | N/A | No sealing required (but now banned for new installs) |

**What's excluded:** Even when an initial seal is included, all ongoing sealing and maintenance is the homeowner's responsibility. Failure to maintain sealing on natural stone can void warranty coverage and lead to staining. Professional re-sealing services typically cost $150 - $400 depending on benchtop size.

**Sealer type matters:** Penetrating (impregnating) sealers are recommended over topical sealers for natural stone benchtops. They soak into the stone and bond with its minerals to form a barrier without changing the surface appearance.

---

### 3.8 Overhang Support Brackets

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — responsibility varies between stone mason and cabinet maker

This is one of the most contested areas of responsibility:

| Overhang Distance | Support Required | Who Typically Provides |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **0 - 150mm** | No additional support needed | N/A |
| **150 - 300mm** | 18mm substrate at 600mm intervals | Cabinet maker provides substrate |
| **300 - 500mm** | Steel support brackets or metal frame | **Disputed** — see below |
| **500mm+** (breakfast bar) | Legs, columns, or structural panels | Cabinet maker / carpenter |

**The disputed zone (300-500mm):** For overhangs requiring steel brackets (common on breakfast bars and island benches), responsibility is unclear and varies:

- **Some stone masons** supply and install brackets as part of their scope (especially for waterfall or island configurations)
- **Some stone masons** expect the cabinet maker or carpenter to have brackets pre-installed before template day
- **Some suppliers** sell brackets separately (e.g., Evostone 304-grade stainless steel brackets via kitchen suppliers like Nover or eKitchens)

**Recommendation for scope documents:** Always specify who is responsible for supplying and installing overhang support brackets. This should be agreed in writing before work commences.

---

### 3.9 Premium Edge Profiles & Waterfall Ends

**Confidence: HIGH**

Standard quotes include a basic edge profile (pencil round or eased edge at 20mm thickness). Premium options are additional:

| Edge Treatment | Extra Cost Impact | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| **40mm mitred (laminated) edge** | +30% to 50% on fabrication | Two pieces mitred and joined to appear 40mm thick |
| **Bullnose edge** | +15% to 25% | Fully rounded edge; more polishing labour |
| **Ogee edge** | +20% to 35% | Decorative S-curve profile |
| **Waterfall end** (stone continues to floor) | +$650 to $2,000+ per end | Depends on whether enough slab remains or a new slab is needed |
| **Bookmatched waterfall** | Additional premium | Veins matched across the mitre; requires specific slab selection |
| **Shark nose / recessed edge** | +20% to 40% | Modern profile with undercut shadow line |

**Waterfall ends** are a particularly common source of cost surprises. They require an additional vertical piece of stone, precision mitred joins, and often pattern matching (bookmatching) to look seamless. If the remaining slab offcut is not large enough, a second full slab may need to be purchased.

---

### 3.10 Site Access & Delivery Surcharges

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

Standard quotes assume reasonable ground-floor access. Surcharges may apply for:

| Access Issue | Typical Surcharge | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **Upper-floor delivery** (stairs, no lift) | $200 - $600+ | Stone slabs are extremely heavy (granite ~80kg/m2 at 20mm) |
| **Narrow access / tight hallways** | $100 - $300 | May limit maximum slab size; more joins required |
| **Regional / outer-metro delivery** | $100 - $500+ | Beyond standard metro delivery radius |
| **CBD / high-rise with building management restrictions** | $200 - $500+ | Booking lifts, after-hours access, loading dock requirements |
| **Crane or hoist required** | $500 - $2,000+ | Rare for residential; occasionally needed for large island pieces |

**Important:** Heavy stone slabs cannot be easily manoeuvred through tight spaces. If access is difficult, the slab may need to be cut into more pieces (meaning more joins in the finished benchtop), which can affect aesthetics.

## 4. Homeowner vs Stone Mason Responsibilities

### Homeowner Responsibilities

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Responsibility | Timing | Details |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Select and purchase sink | Before template day | Must be on-site for stone mason to measure |
| Select and purchase cooktop | Before template day | Must be on-site for stone mason to measure |
| Select and purchase tapware | Before plumber reconnects | Stone mason needs tap hole positions at template |
| Select stone material and colour | Before ordering | Visit supplier showroom; request sample |
| Confirm edge profile and thickness | At quoting stage | Affects price and lead time |
| Confirm all cut-out requirements | At quoting stage | Every hole, groove, and cut-out must be specified |
| Ensure cabinets are complete, level, and secured | Before template day | Within 3mm flat/level over 3m span |
| Remove items from benchtop area | Before template and installation days | Minimise dust exposure to belongings |
| Clear path from front door to kitchen | Installation day | Direct, unobstructed path for heavy slabs |
| Halt other construction activity | During stone installation | Vibration and disruption can compromise adhesive |
| Arrange plumber for disconnection | Before old benchtop removal | Licensed plumber required |
| Arrange plumber for reconnection | 24-48 hours after installation | Allow adhesive to cure |
| Arrange electrician for disconnection/reconnection | Before removal / after installation | Licensed electrician required |
| Maintain sealing (natural stone only) | Ongoing | Per material-specific schedule |
| An adult (18+) must be present | Template and installation days | To answer questions and approve positions |

### Stone Mason Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Laser template / site measure | Precise measurement of all cabinets and cut-out positions |
| Slab selection and cutting | Fabrication to template specifications |
| Edge profiling and polishing | As specified in quote |
| Sink and cooktop cut-outs | As specified (undermount edges polished) |
| Delivery to site | Within quoted metro area |
| Installation and levelling | Secure fixing with adhesive to cabinets |
| Join work | Colour-matched resin/adhesive at join lines |
| Silicone perimeter seal | Where stone meets walls |
| Initial stone sealing (natural stone) | First application of penetrating sealer |
| Clean up of installation area | Removal of packaging, dust, and offcuts |

---

## 5. Trade Coordination Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH**

A stone benchtop installation sits in the middle of a renovation sequence and requires coordination with multiple trades:

### Sequence of Trades (Typical Kitchen Renovation)

| Order | Trade | What They Do | Timing Relative to Stone |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Demolition** | Remove old benchtop, splashback, fixtures | Well before stone template |
| 2 | **Plumber** | Disconnect existing plumbing; rough-in new positions if layout changes | Before template |
| 3 | **Electrician** | Disconnect existing electrical; rough-in new positions | Before template |
| 4 | **Cabinet maker / carpenter** | Install new cabinets; level and secure; install substrates | Must be 100% complete before template |
| 5 | **Stone mason — Template** | Laser measure all surfaces | Cabinets must be finished, appliances on-site |
| 6 | **Stone mason — Fabrication** | 10-15 business days in workshop | No site activity required |
| 7 | **Stone mason — Installation** | Fit benchtop onto cabinets | 2-5 hours on site |
| 8 | **Plumber** | Reconnect sink, dishwasher, gas (if applicable) | Minimum 24-48 hours after stone installation |
| 9 | **Electrician** | Reconnect cooktop, power points | After stone installation |
| 10 | **Tiler / glazier** | Install tile or glass splashback | Measured after stone is installed; minimum 2 days after |
| 11 | **Painter** | Touch up walls if needed | After splashback if required |

### Key Coordination Points

- **Cabinet maker must finish before stone mason templates.** Nothing can change between template and installation.
- **Plumber and electrician disconnect before old benchtop removal.** This is a safety requirement.
- **Appliances and sink must be on-site before template.** Cut-outs are measured to the exact appliance dimensions.
- **Plumber reconnects after adhesive cures.** Connecting plumbing too early can stress the stone before adhesive has set (minimum 24 hours, ideally 48 hours).
- **Splashback (tile or glass) is measured after stone installation.** The splashback sits on top of the benchtop, so exact height measurements require the stone to be in place.
- **Do not lean on or use the benchtop** until adhesive has fully cured (24-48 hours).

---

## 6. Items Commonly Assumed Included But Are NOT

**Confidence: HIGH**

These are the most frequent sources of homeowner surprise and budget blowout:

| Item | Why Homeowners Assume It's Included | Reality |
|------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| **Plumbing disconnection/reconnection** | "I thought the benchtop company would handle everything" | Licensed plumber required; always a separate cost ($400 - $1,200) |
| **Electrical disconnection/reconnection** | Same assumption | Licensed electrician required; always a separate cost ($150 - $600) |
| **Old benchtop removal and disposal** | "Surely they take the old one away" | Some include removal, most charge extra ($350 - $800); disposal/tip fees usually extra |
| **Matching stone splashback** | "It's the same stone, shouldn't it be included?" | Almost always a separate quoted item; full-height splashback can add $800 - $2,500+ |
| **Undermount sink polishing** | "All sinks are undermount these days" | Polishing the exposed interior edge of the cut-out is extra ($200 - $400+) |
| **Waterfall ends** | "I saw it in the showroom display" | Major additional cost ($650 - $2,000+ per end); may require a second slab |
| **40mm thickness** | "I thought 40mm was standard" | 20mm is standard; 40mm mitred edge adds 30-50% to fabrication |
| **Multiple cut-outs** | "I need a soap dispenser hole and a filtered water tap hole" | Only one sink + one cooktop cut-out is standard; each extra is $50 - $250 |
| **Overhang brackets for breakfast bar** | "I assumed the stone company provides supports" | Varies — may be cabinet maker's or stone mason's responsibility; clarify at quoting |
| **Wall repair behind old splashback** | "I didn't know the wall would be damaged" | Old splashback removal often damages plaster; plasterer/painter needed to repair |
| **Ongoing sealing (natural stone)** | "I thought it was maintenance-free" | Natural stone requires regular re-sealing (6-24 months depending on material) |
| **Cabinet levelling** | "My cabinets look fine to me" | Cabinets must be within 3mm over 3m; if they're not, the cabinet maker must fix them before template |

---

## 7. Warranty Exclusions — What Voids Coverage

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Typical Warranty Coverage

| Material Type | Typical Warranty Period | Coverage |
|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| Sintered stone (Dekton, Neolith) | 10 - 25 years | Manufacturing defects |
| Porcelain slabs | 10 years | Manufacturing defects |
| Natural stone (granite, marble) | No standard warranty on stone itself (it's a natural product); fabrication/installation warranty varies by mason | Fabrication and installation workmanship |
| Legacy engineered stone (Caesarstone) | Lifetime (for products installed before ban) | Manufacturing defects in surface quality |

### What Typically Voids or Excludes Warranty

| Exclusion | Explanation |
|-----------|------------|
| **Cracking from inadequate cabinet support** | If cabinets were not level or properly supported, stress cracks are not covered. This is the most common warranty dispute |
| **Cracking from impact or excessive load** | Standing on benchtops, dropping heavy objects, point loads |
| **Thermal shock / heat damage** | Placing hot pots directly on stone; heat from dishwashers or ovens without heat barriers; slow cookers left running for extended periods |
| **Chipping from impact** | Chips on edges from pots, pans, or other impacts are considered mechanical damage, not a defect |
| **Staining from failure to seal** (natural stone) | If homeowner does not maintain sealing schedule, staining is not covered |
| **Staining from harsh chemicals** | Using bleach, vinegar, citrus-based cleaners, hydrofluoric acid, or other acidic/abrasive products |
| **Etching on marble** | Acid etching (from lemon juice, wine, vinegar) on marble is a natural reaction, not a defect |
| **Seam/joint performance** | Joints may discolour or shift slightly over time; not typically warranted |
| **UV exposure / outdoor use** | Most stone benchtop warranties exclude outdoor installations or exposure to direct sunlight |
| **Non-qualified installation** | Warranty void if not installed by a qualified, licensed stone mason |
| **Product relocation** | Warranty void if benchtop is moved from original installation location |
| **Personal preference** | "I don't like the colour/pattern" after installation is never covered |
| **Natural variation in stone** | Colour variation, veining differences, minor pitting, visible resin fills in natural stone are characteristics, not defects |
| **Thickness variation** (natural stone) | Slight variations (+/- 2mm for 20mm slabs, +/- 3mm for 30mm slabs) are standard |

### Warranty Conditions Homeowners Must Meet

1. **Register the warranty** within 30 days of installation (many suppliers require this)
2. **Keep batch/authenticity numbers** found on the underside of the stone
3. **Lodge claims within 28 days** of discovering the issue (some suppliers)
4. **Warranty is non-transferable** to subsequent homeowners in most cases
5. **Follow care and maintenance guidelines** provided by the supplier
6. **Do not modify the stone** after installation without manufacturer approval
