## 1. Critical Context: The Engineered Stone Ban

**Confidence: HIGH**

Australia became the first country in the world to ban engineered stone (quartz composite containing crystalline silica) due to the silicosis health crisis among stone fabrication workers.

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| December 2023 | WHS ministers unanimously agree to ban engineered stone |
| 1 July 2024 | Domestic ban on use, supply, and manufacture takes effect |
| 1 January 2025 | Import ban takes effect under Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations |

### What is banned

All engineered stone benchtops, panels, and slabs containing crystalline silica resin-bound composites. This includes traditional products from Caesarstone, Smartstone, Essastone, Silestone, and similar brands in their conventional formulations.

### What is NOT banned

- **Natural stone** (granite, marble, quartzite, travertine) -- always permitted
- **Porcelain slabs** (e.g., large-format porcelain panels) -- excluded from the ban
- **Sintered stone** (e.g., Dekton, Neolith, Laminam) -- excluded provided they do not contain resin
- **Crystalline silica-free engineered surfaces** (e.g., Caesarstone Mineral, Caesarstone ICON) -- new compliant products developed specifically in response to the ban
- **Repair and minor modification** of pre-existing engineered stone installations

### Impact on Pricing

The ban has had several effects on the benchtop market:

1. **Demand shift**: Significant increase in demand for natural stone, porcelain, and sintered stone alternatives
2. **Price pressure upward**: Porcelain benchtops are estimated to cost approximately 30% more than the premium engineered stone they replaced
3. **New product development**: Caesarstone Mineral and similar silica-free products have entered the market but at price points comparable to or above the old premium engineered stone ranges
4. **Fabricator capacity**: Many former engineered stone fabricators are transitioning to porcelain and natural stone, with varying levels of expertise in these materials
5. **Porcelain installation complexity**: Porcelain is more brittle and requires specialist handling, adding to labour costs compared to the old engineered stone

**The net result for renovation scoping**: Homeowners who previously would have defaulted to a mid-range engineered stone benchtop at $400-$600/m2 are now looking at $700-$1,500/m2 or more for porcelain, natural stone, or silica-free mineral surfaces. This has increased the benchtop line item in kitchen renovations by 30-60% on average.

## 2. How Stone Benchtops Are Priced in Australia

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Pricing convention

Australian stonemasons and benchtop fabricators use several pricing methods:

| Method | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Per square metre (m2)** | Most common for material cost comparisons. Slab prices are often quoted this way | Industry standard for comparing materials |
| **Per slab** | Some suppliers quote a fixed price per slab (e.g., a standard Caesarstone slab is 3050mm x 1440mm = 4.39m2) | Common in supply-only scenarios |
| **Per linear metre** | Based on a standard 600mm benchtop depth. Simpler for homeowners to understand | Sometimes used in consumer-facing quotes |
| **Package / lump sum** | A single price for the entire kitchen benchtop job including template, fabrication, delivery, and installation | Most common for final consumer quotes |

### Converting between square metre and linear metre

For a standard 600mm-deep benchtop:
- **1 linear metre = 0.6 square metres**
- To convert: multiply the per-m2 price by 0.6 to get the per-linear-metre price

For an island bench at 900mm deep:
- **1 linear metre = 0.9 square metres**
- To convert: multiply the per-m2 price by 0.9

### What a "supply and install" quote typically includes

A full supply-and-install quote from a stonemason generally bundles:
- Material (slab)
- Templating (laser or manual measurement on-site)
- Fabrication (cutting, polishing, edge profiling)
- Standard cut-outs (sink, cooktop)
- Delivery
- Installation and silicone sealing

Some fabricators charge add-ons separately for premium edge profiles, waterfall ends, undermount sink polishing, and splashbacks.

## 3. Material Pricing by Type

### 3.1 Engineered Stone / Silica-Free Mineral Surfaces

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (market in transition; new products, pricing not yet fully stabilised)

Traditional engineered stone (e.g., old Caesarstone, Silestone) is now banned. The replacements are crystalline silica-free mineral surfaces.

| Tier | Product Example | Supply + Install per m2 | Approx. per Linear Metre (600mm depth) |
|------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Entry | Caesarstone Mineral Standard | $500 - $700 | $300 - $420 |
| Mid | Caesarstone Mineral Mid-range | $700 - $1,000 | $420 - $600 |
| Premium | Caesarstone ICON / Premium designs | $1,000 - $1,400 | $600 - $840 |

**Notes:**
- Pre-ban engineered stone was typically $400-$600/m2 supply and install. Post-ban silica-free products are trending 20-40% higher
- These are 20mm thickness; 40mm laminated/mitred edge adds further cost (see Section 4.5)
- Pricing still stabilising as these are relatively new products (launched 2024-2025)
- Lifetime warranty offered by Caesarstone on Mineral range

### 3.2 Natural Stone -- Granite

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Tier | Description | Supply + Install per m2 | Approx. per Linear Metre (600mm depth) |
|------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Budget | Common colours (grey, beige, pale tones) | $500 - $800 | $300 - $480 |
| Mid-range | Popular colours (black, white, mixed tones) | $800 - $1,200 | $480 - $720 |
| Premium | Rare patterns, exotic imports | $1,200 - $1,900 | $720 - $1,140 |

**Notes:**
- Granite is one of the most durable natural stone options
- Darker granites (e.g., Absolute Black) tend to cost more than lighter varieties
- Requires periodic sealing (every 12-24 months, $20-$50/m2 for sealing product)
- Demand has increased post-ban, putting moderate upward pressure on pricing

### 3.3 Natural Stone -- Marble

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Tier | Description | Supply + Install per m2 | Approx. per Linear Metre (600mm depth) |
|------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Entry | Common marbles (Carrara, basic white/grey) | $800 - $1,200 | $480 - $720 |
| Mid-range | Higher-grade Carrara, Statuario | $1,200 - $2,000 | $720 - $1,200 |
| Premium | Calacatta, rare exotic marbles | $2,000 - $4,000+ | $1,200 - $2,400+ |

**Notes:**
- Marble is softer and more porous than granite; requires more maintenance
- Calacatta marble commands significant premiums due to rarity
- Must be sealed regularly; susceptible to etching from acidic substances
- Very popular aesthetically, driving strong demand post-ban

### 3.4 Natural Stone -- Quartzite

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Tier | Description | Supply + Install per m2 | Approx. per Linear Metre (600mm depth) |
|------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Entry | Common quartzite varieties | $600 - $1,000 | $360 - $600 |
| Mid-range | Popular patterns and colours | $1,000 - $1,500 | $600 - $900 |
| Premium | Exotic quartzite (Taj Mahal, Patagonia) | $1,500 - $2,500 | $900 - $1,500 |

**Notes:**
- Quartzite (natural) should not be confused with quartz (engineered stone)
- Harder than marble and granite; excellent durability
- Growing in popularity as an alternative to banned engineered stone
- Limited local supply for exotic varieties; pricing can fluctuate

### 3.5 Porcelain / Sintered Stone

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Tier | Product Example | Supply + Install per m2 | Approx. per Linear Metre (600mm depth) |
|------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Budget porcelain | Standard large-format porcelain panels | $700 - $1,000 | $420 - $600 |
| Mid-range | Neolith, mid-range Dekton | $1,000 - $1,500 | $600 - $900 |
| Premium | Dekton premium, premium Neolith | $1,500 - $2,500 | $900 - $1,500 |
| Lightweight composite | LITESTONE (40mm composite panels) | $400 - $700 | $240 - $420 |

**Notes:**
- Porcelain is the primary beneficiary of the engineered stone ban
- Approximately 30% more expensive than the premium engineered stone it replaces
- For standard kitchens (galley or U-shaped), porcelain typically costs $5,000-$6,500 fully installed
- Porcelain at $1,500-$1,600/m2 is a commonly cited average for supply and install
- Requires specialist fabricators; the material is brittle and can crack during handling
- Porcelain pricing generally includes templating, substrates, cutting, installation, and caulking
- LITESTONE is a lightweight composite alternative positioned at "stone for the price of laminate"

---

## 4. Add-On Costs

### 4.1 Waterfall End

**Confidence: HIGH**

A waterfall end continues the benchtop material vertically down one or both sides of an island or peninsula, creating a dramatic visual effect.

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Single waterfall end (natural stone or silica-free engineered) | $500 - $1,000 per end |
| Single waterfall end (porcelain) | $800 - $900 per panel |
| Double waterfall island (two ends) | $1,500 - $3,000 total |

**Notes:**
- The cost depends heavily on the height of the end panel and the material
- Waterfall ends require a mitre joint where the horizontal and vertical surfaces meet; this is a skilled fabrication task
- For a kitchen island with two waterfall ends plus the horizontal benchtop, total stone cost is typically $4,500-$6,000
- Waterfall ends use additional slab material, so the material cost alone is significant on top of the fabrication premium

### 4.2 Undermount Sink Cut-Out

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Standard undermount sink cut-out (with polished edges) | $250 - $400 |
| Top-mount / drop-in sink cut-out | $90 - $150 |
| Flush-mount sink cut-out | $400 - $550 |

**Notes:**
- Undermount sinks are the most expensive cut-out type because the exposed stone edge inside the cut-out must be polished to a finished standard
- Drop-in (top-mount) sinks are cheapest as the sink rim covers the cut edge
- Flush-mount sinks require the most precision and are the most expensive
- Some fabricators include one standard sink cut-out in their base price; always confirm

### 4.3 Cooktop Cut-Out

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Standard cooktop cut-out (rectangular, drop-in) | $90 - $200 |
| Flush-mount cooktop cut-out | $200 - $400 |
| Combined cutting service (sink + cooktop) | $400 - $600 |

**Notes:**
- Cooktop cut-outs are generally simpler and cheaper than undermount sink cut-outs because the edges are typically hidden by the cooktop frame
- Some fabricators bundle sink and cooktop cut-outs into their standard benchtop price
- Modifying an existing benchtop cut-out (e.g., enlarging for a new cooktop) costs $900-$1,500 as a standalone service

### 4.4 Edge Profiles

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Profile Type | Classification | Additional Cost per Lineal Metre |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Arris (sharp square edge) | Standard -- usually included | $0 (included in base price) |
| Pencil round (slightly rounded) | Standard -- usually included | $0 (included in base price) |
| Small bevelled edge | Standard | $0 - $30/lm |
| Half bullnose | Premium | $40 - $80/lm |
| Full bullnose | Premium | $50 - $100/lm |
| Shark nose / chamfered | Premium | $50 - $100/lm |
| Ogee | Premium | $80 - $130/lm |
| Mitred 40mm edge | Premium (see 4.5) | $100 - $150/lm |

**Notes:**
- Most fabricators include a pencil round or arris edge as standard at no extra charge
- Premium profiles (bullnose, ogee, shark nose) add both material and labour cost
- Rounded edges (pencil round, bullnose) are recommended over sharp arris edges as they are less susceptible to chipping
- Mitred joints (for 40mm appearance) are only available with pencil round edge on the visible face
- Edge profile is charged per lineal metre of exposed/visible edge

### 4.5 Laminated (Thicker) Edge

**Confidence: HIGH**

A 40mm benchtop appearance is achieved by laminating (stacking) or mitring a strip of stone onto a standard 20mm slab. Solid 40mm slabs are rarely used in residential applications.

| Method | Description | Cost Premium |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Laminated edge | Two pieces stacked; visible seam at the join | $100 - $130/lm |
| Mitred edge | Two pieces cut at 45 degrees and joined; seamless look | $130 - $180/lm |
| Overall cost increase | Compared to standard 20mm pencil edge | 30 - 50% more on total benchtop cost |

**Notes:**
- A standard 20mm benchtop with pencil edge is the baseline; any thicker appearance is an upgrade
- The mitred edge produces a cleaner look but is more fragile at the join than a laminated edge
- At a typical kitchen run of 3-5 linear metres of visible edge, this upgrade adds $400-$900 to the total benchtop cost
- A 40mm edge profile typically brings the overall cost to $700-$1,500/m2 versus $400-$800/m2 for a standard 20mm edge

### 4.6 Stone Splashback

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

Stone splashbacks use the same or complementary stone material as the benchtop, running from the back of the benchtop up the wall (typically 600mm high between benchtop and overhead cabinets, or a shorter upstand of 100-200mm).

| Type | Cost Range |
|------|-----------|
| Stone upstand (100mm high) per lineal metre | $80 - $200/lm |
| Full-height stone splashback (600mm) per m2 | $500 - $2,500/m2 |
| Full-height stone splashback (600mm) per lineal metre | $300 - $1,500/lm |
| Porcelain full-height splashback (total for typical kitchen) | $2,300 - $3,000 |
| Granite splashback per m2 | $500 - $1,500/m2 |
| Marble splashback per m2 | $800 - $2,500/m2 |

**Notes:**
- A matching stone splashback is typically priced per square metre since the height varies
- A standard kitchen with approximately 3-4 lineal metres of splashback at 600mm height (1.8-2.4m2) would cost $900-$6,000 depending on stone type
- Stone splashbacks are often coordinated with the benchtop fabrication to ensure pattern continuity
- Consider that the splashback adds significant visual impact but also significant cost

---

## 5. Template and Installation

**Confidence: HIGH**

### Is templating separate or bundled?

In the Australian market, **templating is almost always bundled** into a supply-and-install quote. It is not typically broken out as a separate line item.

A "supply and install" quote from a stonemason covers:

| Component | Typically Included? | If Separate, Approximate Cost |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| On-site template / laser measure | Yes (bundled) | $150 - $400 if quoted separately |
| Slab material | Yes | Varies by material (see Section 3) |
| Fabrication (cutting, polishing, edge work) | Yes | $300 - $800 if quoted separately |
| Delivery | Yes | $100 - $300 if quoted separately |
| Installation (fitting, levelling, silicone) | Yes | $300 - $800 if quoted separately |
| Old benchtop removal | Sometimes | $200 - $500 if not included |

### Typical lead times

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Template to fabrication | 1 - 2 weeks |
| Fabrication | 1 - 2 weeks |
| Total from template to install | 2 - 4 weeks |

**Notes:**
- Labour costs for installation alone range from $200-$500 in metro areas
- Some fabricators charge hourly at $50-$80/hour for installation
- Site access complications (stairs, narrow hallways, long carry distances) may incur surcharges of $100-$300
- Removal and disposal of old benchtops is often an additional charge of $200-$500

## 8. Key Price Drivers

**Confidence: HIGH**

The following factors have the most significant impact on stone benchtop pricing, listed in approximate order of impact:

### Factors that significantly affect price

| Factor | Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Material choice** | Very High | The single biggest determinant. Calacatta marble can be 5-8x the cost of entry-level granite |
| **Slab colour/pattern rarity** | High | Even within one stone type, rare or trending patterns command 50-100% premiums |
| **Kitchen size (total m2)** | High | Directly proportional; more surface area = higher cost |
| **Waterfall ends** | High | Each waterfall adds $500-$1,000+ in material and fabrication |
| **Edge profile and thickness** | Medium-High | Upgrading from 20mm pencil round to 40mm mitred adds 30-50% to the total |
| **Number and type of cut-outs** | Medium | Undermount and flush-mount cut-outs add $250-$550 each over standard drop-in |
| **Number of joins** | Medium | L-shaped and U-shaped kitchens require joins that add labour and finishing time |
| **Splashback** | Medium-High | A full-height stone splashback can add $2,000-$6,000 to the project |
| **Site access** | Low-Medium | Difficult access (stairs, narrow entries) can add $100-$300 |
| **Location (capital city)** | Low-Medium | Sydney typically 10-15% higher than Brisbane; Perth and Adelaide slightly higher due to transport |
| **Old benchtop removal** | Low | $200-$500 additional if not included |

---

## 9. Regional Price Variations

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

Pricing does vary across Australian capital cities, primarily driven by labour costs, competition density, and transport logistics.

| City | Relative Price Index | Per m2 Range (natural stone, supply + install) | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | Highest (100%) | $450 - $1,300/m2 | Largest market, most fabricator competition but highest labour costs |
| **Melbourne** | High (95-100%) | $400 - $1,200/m2 | Strong competition among fabricators; comparable to Sydney |
| **Brisbane** | Medium-High (90-95%) | $400 - $1,150/m2 | Slightly lower labour costs; growing market |
| **Perth** | High (95-100%) | $450 - $1,250/m2 | Higher transport costs for imported stone offset by lower labour |
| **Adelaide** | Medium (85-90%) | $400 - $1,100/m2 | Smaller market, fewer fabricators, but lower overheads |
| **Canberra** | Medium-High (90-95%) | $420 - $1,200/m2 | Small market; may source fabrication from Sydney |
| **Hobart** | Medium (85-90%) | $400 - $1,150/m2 | Limited local supply; transport adds cost |
| **Darwin** | High (95-105%) | $500 - $1,400/m2 | Remote location; significant transport surcharges |

**Notes:**
- Regional pricing data is indicative and based on limited sources
- Transport of heavy stone slabs is a meaningful cost component, especially for Perth, Darwin, and Hobart
- Sydney and Melbourne have the most competitive markets with the widest range of fabricators
