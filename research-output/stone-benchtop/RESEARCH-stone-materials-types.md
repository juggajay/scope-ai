## 1. The Engineered Stone Ban

**Confidence: HIGH** (Direct government/regulatory sources)

### What Happened

Australia became the **first country in the world** to ban engineered stone. The ban was driven by a surge in silicosis diagnoses among young stone fabrication workers — an aggressive, incurable lung disease caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust during cutting, grinding, and polishing of engineered stone.

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **13 December 2023** | Safe Work Australia recommended a national ban on engineered stone |
| **1 July 2024** | Ban takes effect across all states and territories — manufacturing, supply, processing, and installation of engineered stone benchtops/panels/slabs is now an offence |
| **1 January 2025** | Import ban — engineered stone benchtops, panels, and slabs become prohibited imports under Customs regulations |

### What Is Banned

Any artificial product that:
- Contains **at least 1% crystalline silica** (by weight)
- Is created by combining natural stone materials with other chemical constituents (resins, pigments, etc.)
- Is in the form of a benchtop, panel, or slab

This covers **all traditional engineered quartz** products — Caesarstone (original quartz range), Silestone (original range), Smartstone (quartz range), Essastone, Quantum Quartz, and similar.

### What Is NOT Banned

- **Natural stone** (granite, marble, quartzite) — contains crystalline silica naturally but is not "engineered"
- **Sintered stone** and **porcelain slabs** (Dekton, Neolith, Laminam) — manufactured differently, typically zero or very low silica
- **New silica-free engineered products** (Caesarstone ICON/Mineral, Cosentino Xeron, Quantum Zero) — reformulated to contain <1% crystalline silica
- **Finished products** that are not benchtops/panels/slabs (e.g., sinks, ornaments)
- **Legacy work**: Removal, repair, or minor modification of already-installed engineered stone is permitted, but the PCBU must notify the WHS regulator before commencing and ensure dust controls are in place

### Impact on the Market

- Several major brands discontinued their Australian quartz ranges entirely (Essastone, Smartstone quartz)
- Others rapidly reformulated with silica-free alternatives (Caesarstone ICON, Quantum Zero, Cosentino Xeron)
- Natural stone and sintered stone/porcelain have seen significant demand increases
- Stone fabricators have had to retool and retrain for different materials
- Homeowners with existing engineered stone can still get repairs/modifications done, but under strict controls

### Health Context

Safe Work Australia estimated the ban would prevent approximately **100 lung cancers and 1,000 silicosis cases** over the lifetime of Australian workers across the supply chain.

## 2. Engineered Stone & Silica-Free Replacements

**Confidence: HIGH** (manufacturer sources, government definitions)

### 2.1 Legacy Engineered Quartz (BANNED — for reference only)

Traditional engineered stone was made from ~90-94% ground natural quartz bound with polymer resins. It was the dominant benchtop material in Australia for 15+ years. The following brands were the major players:

| Brand | Status Post-Ban |
|-------|----------------|
| **Caesarstone** (quartz range) | Discontinued in Australia; replaced by ICON and Mineral collections |
| **Silestone** (original range) | Transitioned to HybriQ+ technology; Xeron launched as zero-silica |
| **Smartstone** (quartz range) | Discontinued; replaced by Smartstone Sintered Collection |
| **Essastone** (Laminex) | Discontinued entirely |
| **Quantum Quartz** | Discontinued; replaced by Quantum Zero |

These products can no longer be manufactured, supplied, processed, or installed in Australia. Existing installations remain in homes and can be repaired under controlled conditions.

### 2.2 Caesarstone — ICON Advanced Mineral Surfaces

## 3. Natural Stone

**Confidence: HIGH** (established materials, well-documented properties)

Natural stone has experienced a resurgence in demand following the engineered stone ban. These materials were never affected by the ban as they are quarried, not engineered.

### 3.1 Granite

**Durability:** Extremely durable. Mohs hardness ~6.5. Resistant to scratches, heat, and acids. One of the most practical natural stones for kitchen use.

**Maintenance:**
- Requires sealing every 1-2 years (penetrating sealer)
- Darker granites may need very little sealing; lighter colours are more porous
- Daily cleaning with mild soap and water
- Very forgiving for everyday kitchen use

**Availability in Australia:** Widely available through all major stone suppliers. Both imported (Indian, Brazilian, Chinese) and some Australian-sourced granites. Extensive colour range from blacks and greys to whites, browns, blues, and multi-coloured.

**Pricing:** $500-$1,700/m2 (material + fabrication + installation). Average range $700-$1,200/m2.

**Warranty:** Natural stone does not carry manufacturer warranties in the same way as engineered products. Fabricator workmanship warranties vary (typically 1-5 years).

**Best suited for:** High-traffic kitchens, families, anyone wanting durability with minimal maintenance.

### 3.2 Marble

**Popular varieties in Australia:**
- **Carrara** — Italian origin, grey-white with soft grey veining. The most common and affordable marble. Widely available.
- **Calacatta** — Italian origin, whiter base with bolder, more dramatic gold/grey veining. Premium pricing. Can be $3,000-$4,000+/m2 for top-grade slabs.
- **Statuario** — Italian, bright white with grey/gold veining. Very premium.
- **Elba** — Similar to Calacatta but with warmer tones.

**Durability:** Softer than granite (Mohs ~3-4). Susceptible to:
- **Etching** from acids (lemon, tomato, vinegar, wine) — even sealed marble will etch
- **Staining** from oil-based substances, red wine, coffee
- **Scratching** — more easily than granite or quartzite
- **Chipping** at edges, especially with square profiles

**Maintenance (critical for scope):**
- **Sealing:** Penetrating sealant required. Reseal every 6-12 months depending on usage and stone porosity
- **Cleaning:** pH-neutral cleaners only. No vinegar, lemon, bleach, or abrasive products
- **Heat:** Do not place hot items directly on surface — risk of thermal cracking
- **Professional restoration:** Polishing and honing services available from specialist marble restoration companies

**Pricing:** $800-$2,500/m2 installed. Premium varieties (Calacatta) can reach $4,000+/m2.

**Scope implication:** Marble benchtops should include a note about sealing requirements and ongoing maintenance in the scope document. Homeowners must understand marble will develop a patina over time.

**Best suited for:** Bathrooms (lower acid exposure), feature islands with careful owners, those who accept natural aging/patina.

### 3.3 Quartzite

**Important distinction:** Quartzite is a **natural stone** (metamorphosed sandstone). It is NOT the same as quartz/engineered stone. This causes frequent confusion.

**Durability:** Exceptional. Mohs hardness ~7 (harder than granite). Highly resistant to:
- Scratches
- Heat
- Acid etching (unlike marble)
- UV fading

**Maintenance:**
- Seal once per year (some very dense quartzites like Taj Mahal or Cristallo may need less)
- Daily cleaning with mild soap and water
- Much more forgiving than marble

**Availability in Australia:** Growing in popularity. Primarily imported (Brazilian quartzites are most common). Available through premium stone suppliers. Popular varieties include Super White, Taj Mahal, Mont Blanc, Cristallo.

**Pricing:** $600-$2,000/m2 installed. Premium varieties at the higher end.

**Best suited for:** Homeowners who want the look of marble with the durability of granite. Excellent kitchen benchtop choice.

### 3.4 Limestone

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

**Suitability for benchtops:** Generally **not recommended** for kitchen benchtops.

- Very soft and porous (softer than marble)
- Composed primarily of calcite — highly reactive to acids
- Stains very easily; spills soak in rapidly
- Requires very frequent sealing
- Scratches and chips easily

**Where it works:** Bathroom vanities (less acid exposure), decorative surfaces with very light use.

**Pricing:** $500-$1,200/m2 installed.

**Scope implication:** If a homeowner requests limestone for a kitchen benchtop, the scope should flag maintenance concerns. Most stone masons will advise against it for kitchen use.

### 3.5 Travertine

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

**Suitability for benchtops:** Marginal — **can be done but requires significant commitment to maintenance.**

- More porous than marble (the most porous of the common natural stones)
- Naturally has small voids/holes that are typically filled during processing
- Susceptible to staining, etching, and scratching
- Reacts to acids like marble and limestone
- Requires sealing 1-2 times per year
- pH-neutral cleaners only

**Advantages:**
- Naturally stays cool (useful in Australian kitchens)
- Beautiful warm, earthy aesthetic
- Unique character with its natural voids and tonal variation

**Pricing:** $500-$1,500/m2 installed.

**Scope implication:** Similar to limestone — flag maintenance requirements. Not a common kitchen benchtop choice in Australia. More commonly seen in bathroom applications and flooring.

### 3.6 Natural Stone Summary

| Stone | Hardness (Mohs) | Acid Resistant | Sealing Frequency | Kitchen Suitability | Price Range (installed) |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Granite | ~6.5 | Good | Every 1-2 years | Excellent | $500-$1,700/m2 |
| Marble | ~3-4 | Poor | Every 6-12 months | Fair (with care) | $800-$4,000+/m2 |
| Quartzite | ~7 | Good | Every 12 months | Excellent | $600-$2,000/m2 |
| Limestone | ~3 | Very poor | Every 3-6 months | Poor | $500-$1,200/m2 |
| Travertine | ~4 | Poor | Every 6-12 months | Poor-Fair | $500-$1,500/m2 |

## 4. Sintered Stone & Porcelain Slabs

**Confidence: HIGH** (rapidly growing category, well-documented)

This is the **fastest-growing benchtop category in Australia** post-ban. Sintered stone and porcelain slabs are manufactured by compressing natural minerals (clays, feldspar, silica sand, mineral oxides) at extremely high temperatures (1,200C+), creating a dense, non-porous surface.

### 4.1 Dekton (Cosentino)

**Type:** Ultra-compact sintered stone

**Warranty:** 25-year warranty.

**Distributed by:** Cosentino Australia (national distribution, showrooms in major cities).

### 4.2 Neolith (TheSize)

**Type:** Sintered compact surface

**Key properties:**
- Non-porous, zero water absorption
- UV resistant
- Scratch, stain, heat, and chemical resistant
- Lightweight (especially in thinner formats)

**Thickness options:**
- 3mm — vertical/cladding applications only
- 6mm — floors, walls, facades

**Colours:** 38+ colours across multiple collections. Four finish types:
- Natural (matte, slightly textured)
- Silk (soft touch)
- Polished (glossy, reflective)
- Riverwashed (bush hammered/aged)

**Distributed by:** CDK Stone (national distributor in Australia).

**Pricing:** Similar range to Dekton. Contact CDK Stone for current Australian pricing.

### 4.3 Laminam

**Type:** Large-format porcelain slab

**Key properties:**
- Available in extremely thin formats (3mm)
- Non-porous
- Suitable for benchtops, splashbacks, cladding, floors
- Lighter than many competitors in thin formats

**Thickness options:** 3mm, 5mm, 12mm, 20mm

**Distributed by:** Various Australian suppliers including Artedomus.

### 4.4 Other Sintered/Porcelain Brands in Australia

| Brand | Type | Distributor | Notes |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| **Asetica** | Sintered stone | Asetica Australia | Claims zero silica, zero resin |
| **Florim/Florimstone** | Porcelain | Various | Italian manufacturer, large format |
| **Maximum (Fiandre)** | Porcelain | Various | Available nationally |
| **Sapienstone** | Porcelain | Various | Designed specifically for kitchen use |

### 4.5 Sintered Stone vs Porcelain — Key Differences

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (industry distinction is somewhat blurred)

Both are fired at high temperatures, but there are practical differences:

| Property | Sintered Stone (Dekton) | Porcelain Slabs (Neolith, Laminam) |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Composition | Blend of minerals, no resins | Clay-based ceramic body |
| Silica content | Zero/very low | Varies — some contain silica in the body |
| Strength | Generally stronger | More susceptible to chipping under tension |
| Repairability | Difficult | Difficult (chips are a known concern) |
| Weight | Heavier in equivalent thickness | Can be lighter (especially thin formats) |
| Cost | Premium | Varies by brand/thickness |

**Important fabrication note:** Porcelain slabs can be more susceptible to **chipping and cracking** during fabrication and handling than sintered stone. This is a known industry concern and affects which fabricators are willing to work with them. Stone masons need specific training and tooling for porcelain/sintered work.

## 5. Other Benchtop Materials

These are included for completeness and comparison. Most fall outside the stone mason's direct scope but may appear in renovation projects.

### 5.1 Solid Surface (Corian and Similar)

**Confidence: HIGH**

**What it is:** Acrylic/polyester resin blended with natural minerals. Brand names include Corian (DuPont/now part of a separate company), Hi-Macs, Staron, Meganite, Durasein.

**Key properties:**
- Seamless joins (can be sanded invisible)
- Non-porous, hygienic
- Repairable — scratches can be sanded out
- Thermoformable — can be curved and shaped
- Available in hundreds of colours

**Who installs:** **Specialist solid surface fabricators** — NOT stone masons. Separate trade. Companies like CASF (Corian Authorised Service Fabricators), SCF Interiors, TKIC specialise in this.

**Pricing:** $1,000-$1,200/m2 installed (average).

**Scope implication:** If a homeowner selects Corian/solid surface, this is a **different trade** from a stone mason. The scope-of-works should reference a solid surface specialist, not a stone mason.

### 5.2 Concrete Benchtops

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

**What it is:** Custom-cast concrete, often Glass Fibre Reinforced Concrete (GFRC). Can be poured in-situ or pre-cast in a workshop.

**Key properties:**
- Completely custom shapes, colours, integral sinks
- Industrial/minimalist aesthetic
- Heavy (requires appropriate cabinet support)
- Requires sealing
- Can develop hairline cracks over time (considered part of the aesthetic by some)

**Who makes/installs:** **Specialist concrete fabricators** — a niche trade. Key Australian companies:
- Benchmark Benchtops (Melbourne)
- Cast Concepts (Melbourne)
- Policrete (national)
- Cast-in Concrete Design (Gold Coast/Brisbane)
- Slab Culture (GFRC specialist)
- Domcrete (supplies GFRC mix for fabricators)

**Pricing:** $1,000-$1,750/m2 installed. Labour-intensive fabrication drives costs up.

**Scope implication:** This is a **specialist trade**, not a stone mason. Should be scoped separately.

### 5.3 Timber Benchtops

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

**What it is:** Solid hardwood or laminated timber benchtop surfaces.

**Popular Australian species:** Tasmanian Oak, Jarrah, Blackbutt, Spotted Gum, Ironbark, Walnut, Bamboo.

**Who installs:** Typically supplied and installed by **cabinet makers** or **specialist timber benchtop companies** (e.g., Market Timbers Melbourne, JT Benchtops, Brisbane Timber Benchtops, Think Benchtops).

**Pricing:** $350-$600/m2 (bamboo/panels), $600-$1,600+/m2 (solid hardwood, installed).

**Maintenance:** Requires regular oiling/sealing. Susceptible to heat, water, and scratching. High-maintenance compared to stone.

**Scope implication:** **Not stone mason scope.** Cabinet maker or specialist timber supplier.

### 5.4 Laminate Benchtops

**Confidence: HIGH**

**What it is:** High-pressure laminate (HPL) bonded to a particleboard/MDF substrate. Dominant brand in Australia is **Laminex**.

**Key properties:**
- Most affordable benchtop option
- Huge colour/pattern range (including stone-look TrueScale technology)
- Impact, scratch, and stain resistant (HPL)
- Cannot be repaired if chipped
- Not heat resistant (hot pan damage)
- Made in Australia (Laminex)

**Who supplies/installs:** **Cabinet makers** — laminate benchtops are typically supplied as part of the kitchen cabinetry package. Not a stone mason scope.

**Pricing:** $200-$600/m2 installed (significantly cheaper than stone).

**Scope implication:** **Not stone mason scope.** Supplied by cabinet maker.

### 5.5 Stainless Steel Benchtops

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

**What it is:** Grade 304 or 316 stainless steel, custom fabricated.

**Who installs:** **Specialist stainless steel fabricators** (e.g., Martin Stainless Steel Sydney, A Class Metals, Toole Stainless Steel, ABCO Stainless Steel Melbourne).

**Typical use:** Commercial kitchens, butler's pantries, laundries. Less common in residential main kitchens.

**Pricing:** $1,500-$3,000+/m2 (custom fabrication, varies significantly by specification).

**Scope implication:** **Specialist trade** — not stone mason scope.

### 5.6 Material Scope Summary

## 6. Thickness Options

**Confidence: HIGH** (industry standard, manufacturer specifications)

### Standard Slab Thicknesses

| Thickness | Availability | Typical Use | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **12mm** | Sintered/porcelain only | Benchtops (modern, thin look) | Requires careful support; popular for waterfall ends |
| **20mm** | All materials | Standard benchtop thickness | Most common. Most colour ranges available. Most cost-effective |
| **30mm** | Limited natural stone, some engineered | Benchtops (substantial feel) | Not all colours available; check with supplier |
| **40mm** | Achieved via lamination (20mm + 20mm) or solid slab | Island benchtops, statement pieces | Significant cost premium if solid 40mm slab |

### Laminated (Built-Up) Edges

The most common way to achieve a thicker appearance is to **laminate** — bonding a strip of matching stone underneath the front edge to create the appearance of a thicker slab. This is standard practice across the industry.

- **20mm slab with 40mm laminated edge** is the most popular combination in Australian kitchens — gives the visual weight of 40mm on the island bench while keeping costs down on back benches at standard 20mm
- Laminated edges can be done as a **layered join** (two pieces stacked, visible seam at the join line) or a **mitred join** (both pieces cut at 45 degrees for a near-invisible join)
- Mitred joins are more expensive but look significantly better, especially with veined stones where the pattern continues around the edge

### Thickness Impact on Cost

- 20mm is the baseline pricing
- 30mm slabs (where available) typically add 20-40% to material cost
- 40mm laminated edge adds $80-$150 per linear metre (for the lamination work)
- Full 40mm solid slab (not laminated) can add 60-100% to material cost and is heavy — cabinet support must be verified

---

## 7. Edge Profiles

**Confidence: HIGH** (stone fabricator standard offerings)

### Common Edge Profiles Available in Australia

| Profile | Description | Durability | Style | Typical Cost |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Pencil Round** | Slight rounding on the top edge (2-3mm radius). Clean, minimal | Very good — rounded edges resist chipping | Contemporary, minimal | Standard (included) |
| **Square/Arris** | Sharp 90-degree edge with a very slight 1-2mm ease | Lower — sharp corners can chip | Ultra-modern, architectural | Standard (included) |
| **Eased Edge** | Square with a slight softening (3-4mm radius) | Good | Modern, versatile | Standard (included) |
| **Bevel/Chamfer** | Angled cut on top edge (typically 45-degree, small) | Good | Modern-traditional | Minimal upcharge |
| **Half Bullnose** | Rounded on top edge, flat on bottom | Good | Classic, softer look | Moderate upcharge |
| **Full Bullnose** | Fully rounded from top to bottom | Excellent — no sharp edges | Classic, traditional | Moderate upcharge |
| **Shark Nose / Demi Bullnose** | Rounded top with a flat reveal underneath | Good | Modern, popular on islands | Moderate upcharge |
| **Lambs Tongue** | Gentle curve with a flat section, resembling a tongue shape | Good | Traditional, period homes | Premium upcharge |
| **Ogee** | S-shaped curve (concave + convex) | Fair — detailed edges can chip | Traditional, ornate | Premium upcharge |
| **Waterfall Mitre** | Benchtop stone continues vertically down the side of the island | Good (when well-fabricated) | High-end contemporary, statement | Significant premium |
| **Mitred Edge** | Two slabs joined at 45 degrees to create a seamless thick edge | Good | Contemporary, clean | Premium — requires precision |

### Edge Profile Rules for Thickness

- **20mm slab:** Any edge profile is available
- **40mm laminated:** Mitred joins are only available with pencil round edge. All other profiles in 40mm+ must use a layered (laminated) join
- **Waterfall mitre:** Requires careful vein-matching for natural stone — adds cost. The stone pattern flows from the horizontal benchtop down the vertical face

### Durability Considerations

- **More rounded profiles** (bullnose, pencil round) are more forgiving and less susceptible to chipping
- **Square/sharp profiles** look clean but chip more easily, especially in softer stones like marble
- **Detailed profiles** (ogee, lambs tongue) can chip at the thin points, especially with softer stones
- **For marble:** Pencil round or half bullnose are strongly recommended over square edges

### Edge Profile Pricing Impact

- Standard edges (pencil round, square, eased) are typically included in the base fabrication price
- Shaped profiles (bullnose, bevel, shark nose) add $30-$80 per linear metre
- Complex profiles (ogee, lambs tongue) add $60-$120 per linear metre
- Waterfall mitres add $300-$600+ per corner (depending on material and vein-matching requirements)

## 9. Scope-of-Works Implications

**Confidence: HIGH** (practical guidance for ScopeAI scope generation)

### What the Stone Mason Scope Must Include

1. **Material specification** — exact product name, colour, thickness, finish
2. **Edge profile** — type, whether laminated or solid, mitred or layered
3. **Cut-outs** — sink (undermount vs drop-in affects scope), cooktop, tap holes
4. **Splashback** — if stone (same or different material), height, returns
5. **Waterfall ends** — if applicable, vein-matching requirements
6. **Templating** — on-site measurement (always done after cabinets are installed)
7. **Sealing** — initial seal (natural stone), and notation of ongoing sealing schedule
8. **Installation** — delivery, placement, levelling, silicone to wall/cabinets
9. **Support requirements** — for overhangs >300mm, corbels or steel brackets needed (provided by cabinet maker or separate)

### Material-Specific Scope Notes

- **Natural stone:** Include sealing schedule in scope/handover documentation
- **Marble:** Explicitly note maintenance requirements and acid sensitivity in scope
- **Sintered/porcelain:** Note that material is non-porous and does not require sealing
- **Legacy engineered stone (repair/modification only):** PCBU must notify WHS regulator; scope must reference dust control measures and regulatory compliance
- **Silica-free engineered:** Confirm product is certified <1% crystalline silica to comply with regulations

### What Is NOT Stone Mason Scope (but commonly confused)

- Cabinet/cupboard supply and install (cabinet maker)
- Plumbing connections to sink (plumber)
- Gas/electric cooktop connection (plumber/electrician)
- Laminate benchtop supply (cabinet maker)
- Timber benchtop supply (timber specialist/cabinet maker)
