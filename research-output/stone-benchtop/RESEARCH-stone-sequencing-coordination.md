## 1. Overview: Why Stone Benchtop Sequencing Is Critical

Stone benchtop installation is one of the most sequencing-dependent trades in any kitchen or bathroom renovation. Unlike many trades that can work somewhat independently, stone benchtops require:

- **Precision dependency on cabinetry** — templates are measured from installed cabinets, so cabinets must be final
- **Appliance dependency** — sinks, cooktops, and taps must be selected (and ideally on site) before templating
- **A fabrication gap** — 7-15 working days between template and installation where no stone work happens, but other trades must coordinate
- **Downstream trade dependency** — plumbers, electricians, and tilers cannot complete final fix until stone is in place

Getting this sequence wrong is one of the most common causes of renovation delays and cost blowouts. A wrong template means re-fabrication (another 7-15 working days lost). A missing sink at template time can delay the entire project by weeks.

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 2. Pre-Template Requirements

Everything in this section must be 100% complete and confirmed before the stonemason visits to template.

### 2.1 Cabinetry — Fully Installed, Level, and Secured

| Requirement | Specification | Why It Matters |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| All base cabinets installed | Fixed to each other, secured to walls and/or floor | Template is measured from actual cabinet positions |
| Cabinets must be level | Maximum 3mm deviation over 3m continuous run | Stone has only 2mm tolerance — uneven cabinets cause cracking |
| End panels installed | All exposed end panels in final position | Affects overhang measurements |
| Island cabinets secured to floor | Bolted down, not just placed | Prevents stone displacement; template assumes fixed position |
| Substrate installed (if required) | 18mm MDF or particle board, level, affixed with L-brackets | Required for thicker edge profiles (>20mm); must be level; cutouts pre-made |
| Substrate offset correct | 25mm for mitred edges, 45mm for laminated edges | Ensures finished stone edge aligns correctly |
| Old benchtop removed (if renovation) | Existing benchtop fully removed, cabinets checked for suitability | Stonemason needs to template from bare cabinets |

**Critical rule: Nothing can move between template and installation. All cabinets must be permanently installed — if anything shifts even a few millimetres, the fabricated stone will not fit.**

**Confidence: HIGH** — Confirmed across Bunnings, Made in Stone, Emporium Stone, Deluxe Stone, and multiple stonemason FAQs.

### 2.2 Sink — Model Confirmed, Ideally On Site

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Sink model and brand confirmed | Exact model number — not just "an undermount 1.5 bowl" |
| Sink on site at template | Best practice — stonemason can physically check fit |
| Mounting style confirmed | Undermount, top-mount/drop-in, or flush-mount — each has different cutout specs |
| Undermount sinks | Must be recessed into substrate with 5mm movement allowance in all directions |
| Minimum clearances | 80mm from front edge to sink cutout; 50mm from rear edge to sink cutout |
| Accessories provided | Drainage bowls, cutting boards, etc. if they affect cutout dimensions |

**Why on site matters:** The stonemason will physically position the sink in the cabinet to verify fit and mark exact cutout positions. If the sink is not on site, the stonemason must work from spec sheets alone — any discrepancy between the spec sheet and the actual product (which happens more often than suppliers admit) means the cutout may be wrong.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.3 Cooktop — Model Confirmed with Dimensions

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Cooktop model confirmed | Exact model — cutout dimensions vary between models even from the same brand |
| Cutout dimensions provided | Width x depth of required opening (from cooktop installation manual) |
| Minimum clearances | 80mm from front edge to cutout; 50mm from rear edge to cutout |
| Gas vs induction/electric | Affects whether gas plumber or electrician does final connection |
| Isolation switch position | For hardwired cooktops, electrician must install accessible isolation switch above the benchtop |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.4 Tap/Mixer — Model Confirmed with Hole Specifications

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Tap model confirmed | Exact model — hole diameter and position vary |
| Hole diameter known | Typically 32-35mm for standard mixers, but varies |
| Number of holes | Single mixer = 1 hole; separate hot/cold = 2 holes; some bridge mixers = 3 holes |
| Tap mounted in stone vs sink | Some taps mount through the sink flange, not the stone — confirm which |
| Minimum clearances | 35mm minimum between sink cutout and tap hole |
| Hole positions decided | Distance from sink, distance from wall/edge |

**Who drills tap holes:** The stonemason typically drills tap holes during fabrication or on site. Some plumbers can drill through stone if they have the correct diamond core drill bit, but this is the stonemason's responsibility in most Australian installations.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.5 Stone Splashback Height (If Applicable)

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Splashback height confirmed | Typically 600mm between benchtop and overhead cabinets |
| Material — stone or tile | If stone splashback, stonemason templates benchtop AND splashback together |
| Powerpoint cutout positions | If stone splashback, electrician must confirm powerpoint positions before template |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.6 Pre-Template Checklist Summary

Before booking the template appointment, all of the following must be true:

- [ ] All base cabinetry installed, level (within 3mm/3m), secured to walls/floor
- [ ] End panels and filler pieces installed
- [ ] Substrate installed and level (if required for edge profile)
- [ ] Sink cutout in substrate completed
- [ ] Cooktop cutout in substrate completed
- [ ] Actual sink on site (not just ordered)
- [ ] Cooktop model confirmed with cutout dimensions on paper
- [ ] Tap/mixer model confirmed with hole size specifications
- [ ] Stone colour/type selected and slab availability confirmed
- [ ] Edge profile selected
- [ ] Overhang dimensions confirmed (and support brackets installed if >300mm)
- [ ] Splashback type and height confirmed (if stone splashback)
- [ ] Powerpoint positions confirmed (if stone splashback)
- [ ] Seam locations discussed (for large benchtops or L-shapes)

## 3. The Templating Process

### 3.1 What Happens During Templating

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Duration | 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on kitchen size and complexity |
| Method — Traditional | Physical MDF templates (3-4mm thick) cut to exact size and shape |
| Method — Digital/Laser | 3D laser templating system (e.g., LT-2D3D from CDK Stone) creates DXF files — 99.99% accuracy |
| Who attends | Stonemason templater + homeowner (to confirm positions and sign off) |
| Output | DXF file or physical template sent to fabrication facility |

### 3.2 What the Templater Needs to Record

- All benchtop dimensions (length, depth, overhang)
- Sink position and cutout dimensions (undermount lip exposure, flush requirements)
- Cooktop cutout position and dimensions
- Tap hole positions and diameters
- Edge profiles per edge (may vary — e.g., pencil round on front, square on wall side)
- Seam locations for joins
- Splashback dimensions (if stone)
- Any notches, curves, or irregular wall profiles
- Overhang measurements for breakfast bars/islands
- Expansion gaps (typically 2-3mm at walls)

### 3.3 Laser Templating

Most modern Australian stonemasons now use laser templating. The process:

1. Tripod set up in the kitchen
2. Laser measuring tool attached and levelled
3. Software captures readings from all cabinet edges, walls, and features
4. DXF file generated and saved
5. File transferred directly to CNC/waterjet machine for fabrication

This eliminates most human measurement error and allows the fabrication facility to program tool paths and cutting profiles directly from the template data.

**Confidence: HIGH** — CDK Stone (Australia's largest stone tooling supplier) confirms laser templating is industry standard.

## 4. Fabrication Window

### 4.1 Typical Lead Times — Template to Installation

| Stone Type | Typical Lead Time | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Natural stone (granite, marble) | 7-14 working days | Standard; may vary by slab availability |
| Sintered stone (Dekton, Neolith) | 10-15 working days | Harder to cut; requires specialised tooling |
| Porcelain slabs | 10-15 working days | Thin and fragile; extra handling precautions; longer fabrication |
| Ultra-compact surfaces | 10-15 working days | Similar to sintered stone |
| Fast-track (20mm natural stone) | 3-5 working days | Available from some suppliers (e.g., Brisbane Benchtops); requires 2 weeks advance notice |
| Fast-track (40mm+) | 5-7 working days | Premium pricing; not universally available |

**Important:** These are working days, not calendar days. A "10 working day" lead time is actually 2 full calendar weeks. During peak renovation season (spring/summer in Australia — September to February), lead times can blow out to 3-4 weeks.

**Confidence: HIGH** — Confirmed across Made in Stone (Sydney), Brisbane Benchtops, Stone Tech (Sydney), United Stone (Melbourne).

### 4.2 What Should Happen During the Fabrication Window

This 2-3 week gap is a critical coordination window. The following trades should be scheduled during this period:

| Trade | Work During Fabrication Window | Why This Timing |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Tiler** | Tile the splashback (if tiled, not stone) | After cabinets are in, before benchtop arrives — see Section 11 |
| **Painter** | Touch-up painting around cabinets | Better to paint before stone is in place to avoid drips/damage |
| **Electrician** | Install powerpoints in splashback area (if not already done) | Must be done before tiling; wiring must be complete |
| **Plumber** | Rough-in check — ensure waste and water positions are accessible | Do NOT do final fix yet — that waits for after stone installation |
| **Cabinet maker** | Install handles/hardware on cabinets | Cosmetic finish work while waiting for stone |

### 4.3 What Should NOT Happen During the Fabrication Window

- **Plumber should NOT install the sink** — there is no benchtop yet
- **Plumber should NOT do final tap connections** — no tap holes yet
- **Electrician should NOT hardwire the cooktop** — no cooktop cutout installed yet
- **No trade should disturb or move any cabinet** — the template is based on current positions

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 5. Installation Day Requirements

### 5.1 Site Preparation

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Clear access path | Stone slabs are extremely heavy (natural granite: ~80kg per linear metre for 600mm deep x 20mm). Path from vehicle to kitchen must be clear |
| Adequate doorway width | Slabs may be 3m+ long depending on layout — check all doorways, hallways, stairwells |
| Floor protection | Drop sheets or cardboard on finished flooring |
| No other trades on site | Stone installation requires full access to the kitchen; no other work should be happening simultaneously |
| Sink and appliances accessible | Even though they won't be installed yet, stonemason may need to dry-fit |

### 5.2 Installation Process

| Step | Duration | Detail |
|------|----------|--------|
| Dry fit | 15-30 min | Place stone on cabinets without adhesive to verify fit against template |
| Adjustments | 0-30 min | Minor trimming if walls are slightly out of square |
| Adhesive application | 15-30 min | Colour-matched adhesive/resin applied to substrate; silicone at walls |
| Stone placement | 15-60 min | Stone sections placed, levelled, and joined |
| Seam work | 15-45 min | Seams filled with colour-matched resin; clamped and polished |
| Sink cutout finishing | 15-30 min | Undermount sink clips positioned (if undermount) |
| Final polish and cleanup | 15-30 min | Remove adhesive squeeze-out, polish seams, clean surfaces |
| **Total** | **1.5-5 hours** | Depends on size, complexity, stone type, and number of seams |

### 5.3 Adhesive and Silicone Cure Times

| Product | Cure Time | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Benchtop adhesive (e.g., Megapoxy PM) | 24 hours full cure at 25 degrees C | No heavy items on benchtop for 24 hours |
| Silicone at wall junction | 24-48 hours | Neutral cure silicone recommended for stone; avoid disturbing |
| Seam resin | 2-4 hours working cure; 24 hours full | Do not stress seams for 24 hours |

**Schedule the plumber no earlier than 2 days after stone installation** to allow full adhesive cure.

**Confidence: HIGH** — Confirmed by Emporium Stone (Melbourne) and Made in Stone (Sydney).

## 6. Post-Installation

### 6.1 Trades That Must Follow Stone Installation

These trades CANNOT complete their work until the stone benchtop is installed:

| Trade | Work After Stone | Typical Timing | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Plumber** | Install undermount/top-mount sink; connect waste pipe; install and connect taps | 2+ days after stone install (adhesive cure) | Licensed plumber required; must comply with AS/NZS 3500 |
| **Plumber** | Connect dishwasher waste and water (if under benchtop) | Same visit as sink | |
| **Electrician** | Hardwire cooktop (if induction/electric) | After cooktop placed in cutout | Licensed electrician required; must install isolation switch above benchtop per AS/NZS 3000 |
| **Gas fitter** | Connect gas cooktop (if gas) | After cooktop placed in cutout | Licensed gas fitter required |
| **Stonemason** | Apply penetrating sealer (if natural stone — granite, marble) | 24-48 hours after install | Not required for sintered stone or porcelain |
| **Tiler** | Tile splashback (if tiling AFTER benchtop — see Section 11) | After stone install, before plumber final fix | |
| **Silicone specialist** | Apply sanitary-grade silicone at benchtop-to-splashback junction | After tiling is complete | Use neutral cure, mould-resistant silicone |

### 6.2 Post-Installation Sequence (Recommended Order)

1. **Day 0:** Stone installed. No work for 24 hours (cure time).
2. **Day 2-3:** Plumber installs sink, connects waste, installs taps, tests for leaks.
3. **Day 2-3:** Electrician/gas fitter connects cooktop (can often happen same day as plumber).
4. **Day 3-4:** Final silicone touch-ups at wall junctions and splashback.
5. **Day 4-5:** Stone sealer applied (natural stone only).
6. **Day 5-7:** Kitchen functional for use.

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 7. Full Sequencing Timeline — Stone Benchtop in Context

This shows where stone benchtop work falls within a complete kitchen renovation:

### 7.1 Kitchen Renovation — Stone Benchtop Sequencing (Typical 6-8 Week Build)

| Week | Phase | Key Activities | Stone-Related Milestones |
|------|-------|---------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | Demolition | Strip out old kitchen, remove old benchtop, protect floors | - |
| 1-2 | Rough-in | Plumber moves pipes if needed; electrician moves wiring; plasterer repairs walls | Confirm stone colour and slab availability |
| 2-3 | Plastering & painting | Walls repaired and painted (at least first coat) | Order sink, cooktop, and taps if not already done |
| 3 | Cabinet installation | Cabinets delivered, installed, levelled, secured; substrate installed | **Sink must be on site before end of this week** |
| 3 (end) | **STONE TEMPLATE** | Stonemason visits, templates from installed cabinets | **Everything from Section 2 must be complete** |
| 4-5 | Fabrication window | Splashback tiling (see Section 11); painter touch-up; cabinet handles | Stone being fabricated off-site (7-15 working days) |
| 5-6 | **STONE INSTALLATION** | Stonemason installs benchtop | 24hr cure time before next trade |
| 6 | Plumber final fix | Sink installed, taps connected, waste plumbed | 2+ days after stone install |
| 6 | Electrician final fix | Cooktop connected, isolation switch installed | Can often happen same day as plumber |
| 6-7 | Final finishes | Handles, trim, silicon, sealing, cleaning | Stone sealed if natural stone |
| 7-8 | Handover | Defect inspection, final clean, documentation | Kitchen functional |

### 7.2 Timeline Sensitivity Analysis

| Delay Scenario | Impact | Recovery |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| Sink not on site at template | Template delayed 1-4 weeks (until sink arrives) | Order sink minimum 4 weeks before cabinet install date |
| Cabinets not level at template time | Template delayed 1-3 days (until cabinet maker returns to re-level) | Builder should check level BEFORE calling stonemason |
| Cooktop model changed after template | If cutout size changes, stone may need re-fabrication (7-15 working days lost) | Confirm cooktop BEFORE template; do not change after |
| Tap model changed after template | If hole size/position changes, may need re-drill or re-fabrication | Confirm tap model BEFORE template |
| Peak season fabrication delay | Add 5-10 working days to lead time | Book stonemason early; template as soon as cabinets are ready |

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 8. Trade Coordination Matrix

This matrix shows the dependencies between stone benchtop work and every other trade involved in a kitchen renovation.

### 8.1 Trades That Must Complete BEFORE Stone Template

| Trade | What Must Be Done | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| **Cabinet maker** | All base cabinets installed, level, secured, end panels fitted | Template is measured from installed cabinets |
| **Cabinet maker** | Substrate installed with sink and cooktop cutouts | Stone sits on substrate; cutouts must match |
| **Plumber** | Rough-in complete (waste positions, water points accessible) | Plumber needs to confirm waste and water can reach sink position |
| **Electrician** | Rough-in complete (wiring in walls, powerpoint locations marked) | Powerpoint positions affect stone splashback template (if applicable) |
| **Plasterer** | Walls finished and smooth behind splashback area | Template needs to account for wall surface |

### 8.2 Trades That Work DURING Fabrication Window

| Trade | What They Do | Coordination Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Tiler** | Tile splashback (recommended timing — see Section 11) | Must tile to a level line where benchtop will sit; leave gap for stone |
| **Painter** | Final paint coat around kitchen area | Do before stone arrives to avoid damage risk |
| **Electrician** | Install powerpoints in splashback area | Must be done BEFORE tiler tiles over them |

### 8.3 Trades That Must Wait UNTIL AFTER Stone Installation

| Trade | What They Do | Minimum Wait |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Plumber** | Install sink, connect waste, install taps, test | 48 hours after stone install |
| **Electrician** | Hardwire cooktop, install isolation switch | 24 hours after stone install |
| **Gas fitter** | Connect gas cooktop | 24 hours after stone install |
| **Stonemason** | Seal natural stone benchtop | 24-48 hours after install |

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 9. Common Sequencing Mistakes

### 9.1 Mistake: Tiling Splashback AFTER Benchtop Is Installed

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | If tiles are installed after the benchtop is in place, the bottom row of tiles sits ON TOP of the benchtop surface |
| **The problem** | Creates a visible silicone line between tile and stone; prone to mould; looks unprofessional; difficult to replace tiles later without damaging stone |
| **The correct approach** | Tile the splashback during the fabrication window (after cabinets, before stone). Tile down to the level where the benchtop will sit. When stone is installed, it butts up neatly against the bottom of the tiles |
| **Exception** | Stone splashback is templated and fabricated at the same time as the benchtop — installed as a unit |

**Confidence: HIGH** — This is the single most common sequencing error in Australian kitchen renovations. Confirmed across Bunnings Community, Whirlpool Forums, and multiple tiling guides.

### 9.2 Mistake: Templating Before Cabinets Are Final

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Stonemason templates while cabinets are still being adjusted, not yet secured, or before end panels are fitted |
| **The problem** | ANY movement between template and installation means the stone won't fit. Even 2-3mm shift can cause gaps or overhangs |
| **The cost** | Re-template + re-fabrication = 7-15 working days delay + possible re-fabrication cost |
| **The correct approach** | Only template once ALL cabinetry work is 100% complete and builder has signed off that cabinets are final |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 9.3 Mistake: Sink Not On Site at Template

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Homeowner has ordered the sink but it hasn't arrived; stonemason templates from spec sheet only |
| **The problem** | Spec sheets can be inaccurate; actual sink dimensions may differ by 2-5mm; undermount clip positions may not match |
| **The cost** | At best, a slightly imperfect fit. At worst, sink doesn't fit and stone needs modification or re-fabrication |
| **The correct approach** | Order sink minimum 4-6 weeks before anticipated template date. Have it physically on site. Stonemason should dry-fit in cabinet at template time |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 9.4 Mistake: Changing Tap Model After Template

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Homeowner changes tap selection after template has been done and stone is in fabrication |
| **The problem** | Different tap = different hole diameter and/or position. Holes are already programmed into the CNC cut file |
| **The cost** | If caught before cutting: delay while template is updated. If caught after cutting: stone may need to be re-fabricated entirely (holes cannot be "moved" in stone) |
| **The correct approach** | Finalise tap selection BEFORE template. If changing after template, call stonemason IMMEDIATELY — there may be a window to update the file before cutting begins |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 9.5 Mistake: Plumber Doing Final Fix Before Stone Is Installed

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Plumber installs tap fittings or connects waste before benchtop arrives |
| **The problem** | Plumbing components may interfere with stone placement; stonemason cannot slide stone into position; risk of damaging plumbing during stone installation |
| **The correct approach** | Plumber does rough-in only before stone. Final fix (sink, taps, waste connections) happens AFTER stone is installed and cured |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 9.6 Mistake: Not Allowing Cure Time Before Plumber Visits

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Plumber arrives the same day or next morning after stone installation |
| **The problem** | Adhesive and silicone need 24 hours minimum to cure. Plumber pushing/pulling on sink and taps can shift the stone before it's bonded |
| **The correct approach** | Schedule plumber minimum 48 hours after stone installation |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 9.7 Mistake: Not Confirming Cooktop Cutout Before Ordering Stone

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Homeowner upgrades cooktop model after template, or buys a slightly different size |
| **The problem** | New cooktop may be larger than the cutout — cannot enlarge a cutout in installed stone without risk of cracking. Or new cooktop may be smaller, leaving visible gaps |
| **The cost** | If cooktop is too large: need WorkSafe-approved professional to cut stone on-site (wet cutting, expensive) or re-fabricate. If too small: may need filler strips |
| **The correct approach** | Confirm exact cooktop model with installation manual BEFORE template. Do not change after |

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 10. Material-Specific Sequencing Considerations

Since the engineered stone ban (1 July 2024), Australian renovators are choosing between natural stone, sintered stone, and porcelain. Each has slightly different sequencing implications.

### 10.1 Natural Stone (Granite, Marble, Quartzite)

| Aspect | Sequencing Impact |
|--------|------------------|
| Weight | Heavier than alternatives — access path planning more critical |
| Fabrication time | 7-14 working days (standard) |
| Sealing | Requires penetrating sealer 24-48 hours after installation; adds a step |
| Ongoing sealing | Marble and some granites need annual re-sealing |
| Porosity | Marble is porous — plumber must be careful not to stain during sink install |
| Chipping risk | Natural stone can chip during installation — stonemason needs clear, careful access |

### 10.2 Sintered Stone (Dekton, Neolith, Asetica)

| Aspect | Sequencing Impact |
|--------|------------------|
| Weight | Extremely heavy — may need additional people for installation |
| Fabrication time | 10-15 working days (harder to cut, requires specialised diamond tooling) |
| Sealing | Not required — non-porous surface |
| Brittleness | More rigid than natural stone — substrate must be extremely level (2mm tolerance critical) |
| Cost impact | Cutting/fabrication costs higher — budget for longer fabrication time |

### 10.3 Porcelain Slabs

| Aspect | Sequencing Impact |
|--------|------------------|
| Weight | Lighter and thinner than other options — easier to transport and install |
| Fabrication time | 10-15 working days (fragile; requires extra handling precautions during fabrication) |
| Sealing | Not required |
| Fragility | Thin slabs (6-12mm) need full substrate support — no unsupported overhangs |
| Reinforcement | Often needs mesh backing or substrate lamination — adds fabrication time |

**Confidence: HIGH** — Material properties confirmed via Asetica, Smartstone, Attila's Natural Stone, and Stone Tech (Sydney).

## 11. Splashback Sequencing — The Critical Decision

The relationship between benchtop and splashback is the single most debated sequencing question in Australian kitchen renovations. The answer depends on the splashback material.

### 11.1 Tiled Splashback — Best Practice Sequence

**Recommended: Tile DURING the fabrication window (after cabinets, before stone arrives)**

| Step | Timing | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Cabinets installed | Week 3 | Level and secured |
| 2. Electrician installs powerpoints in splashback zone | Week 3-4 | Before tiling covers the wall |
| 3. **Tiler tiles splashback** | **Week 4-5 (fabrication window)** | Tile from overhead cabinets DOWN to the line where benchtop surface will sit. Use a temporary straight edge/batten as a guide for the bottom tile row |
| 4. Stone benchtop installed | Week 5-6 | Top surface meets bottom of tiles — clean junction |
| 5. Silicone applied at tile-to-stone junction | Day after stone install | Neutral cure, colour-matched, sanitary-grade |

**Why this order:**
- Tiles sit BEHIND the stone edge, creating a clean shadow line
- No risk of tile adhesive or grout dripping onto the stone surface
- No ugly thick silicone bead between tile bottom and stone top
- Easier for tiler to work without a heavy stone benchtop in the way
- If tiles ever need replacing, they can be removed without disturbing the stone

**The alternative (tiling after stone) creates problems:**
- Bottom tile row sits ON the stone, creating a visible silicone line
- Tile adhesive and grout can stain or damage the stone surface
- The junction is prone to mould growth in the silicone
- Looks less professional

### 11.2 Stone Splashback — Same Template, Same Installation

| Step | Timing | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Cabinets installed | Week 3 | Splashback height confirmed |
| 2. Electrician rough-in for powerpoints in splashback zone | Week 3 | Powerpoint positions must be exact — stonemason cuts holes |
| 3. **Stone template** | Week 3 (end) | Stonemason templates BOTH benchtop and splashback together |
| 4. Fabrication | Week 4-5 | Both pieces fabricated as a coordinated set |
| 5. **Stone benchtop + splashback installed** | Week 5-6 | Installed together for seamless join |
| 6. Electrician installs powerpoint faceplates | After stone | Faceplates screw into pre-cut holes |

### 11.3 Glass Splashback — After Stone

Glass splashbacks are always installed AFTER the benchtop:

| Step | Timing | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Stone benchtop installed | Week 5-6 | - |
| 2. Glazier measures | After stone install | Measures from actual stone surface to overhead cabinets |
| 3. Glass fabricated | 5-10 working days | Custom cut and finished |
| 4. Glass splashback installed | Week 7-8 | Adhered to wall with structural silicone |

**Confidence: HIGH** — Sequencing confirmed via Bunnings guides, TileCloud, Fantastic Handyman (AU), and HomeOne forum.

## 12. Special Configurations

### 12.1 Waterfall Edges (Island Benchtops)

Waterfall edges — where the stone continues vertically down the side of an island — add complexity:

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Template complexity | Both horizontal and vertical surfaces must be templated; mitre join angle must be exact |
| Fabrication time | Add 2-5 working days to standard lead time for waterfall cuts and polishing |
| Installation complexity | Requires precise alignment of mitre join; colour-matched adhesive at seam |
| Support structure | Cabinet end panel must be specifically built to support the vertical stone panel |
| Weight | Additional stone weight must be accounted for in cabinet/floor structure |

### 12.2 Bathroom Vanity Benchtops

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Same process, smaller scale | Template → fabricate → install → plumber |
| Often single piece | Less seam work; faster fabrication (5-10 working days) |
| Vessel basin vs undermount | Vessel basins sit on top of stone (just a waste hole needed). Undermount: full cutout |
| Waterproofing coordination | Bathroom waterproofing membrane MUST be complete and certified before vanity cabinet install, which comes before stone template |

### 12.3 Laundry Benchtops

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Simpler scope | Usually just a sink cutout; no cooktop |
| Same sequencing rules apply | Cabinets installed → template → fabricate → install → plumber |
| Often combined with kitchen | If renovating kitchen and laundry simultaneously, stonemason can template both on the same visit to save a trip |

### 12.4 Outdoor Kitchen Benchtops

| Consideration | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| Material selection | Porcelain or granite preferred — UV stable, weather resistant. Marble not recommended outdoors |
| Additional sealing | Natural stone needs outdoor-grade sealer; more frequent re-sealing |
| Substrate requirements | Marine-grade or weather-resistant substrate; standard MDF will swell in moisture |
| Drainage | Benchtop may need slight fall for water runoff — discuss at template stage |

**Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH** — Bathroom, laundry, and outdoor configurations follow the same fundamental sequencing principles but with fewer online sources specifically addressing their timelines.
