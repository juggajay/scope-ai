## 1. Material Types Available in Australia (Post-Ban)

**Confidence: HIGH**

The engineered stone ban has reshaped the Australian benchtop market. The following material categories are available for stone benchtop scopes as of 2025/2026:

| Material Type | Examples | Key Characteristics | Status |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Natural Stone — Granite** | Various quarried granites | Extremely hard-wearing, heat-resistant, unique veining, requires periodic sealing | Fully legal, no restrictions |
| **Natural Stone — Marble** | Carrara, Calacatta, local varieties | Softer and more porous than granite, requires regular sealing, susceptible to acid etching | Fully legal, no restrictions |
| **Natural Stone — Quartzite** | Various quarried quartzite | Harder than marble, natural veining, heat-resistant | Fully legal, no restrictions |
| **Sintered Stone** | Dekton (Cosentino), Neolith, Lapitec, Asetica | 100% natural minerals fused at high temperature, UV-stable, heat/scratch-resistant, ultra-slim profiles available | Fully legal, never banned |
| **Porcelain** | Large-format porcelain slabs | Ultra-slim (6-12mm typical), heat-resistant, UV-stable, lightweight, gaining strong momentum in 2026 | Fully legal, never banned |
| **Silica-Free Engineered Stone** | Caesarstone Mineral, Caesarstone ICON, Essastone alternatives | Compliant products with <1% crystalline silica, similar aesthetics to traditional engineered stone | Legal — must be certified compliant |
| **Acrylic Solid Surface** | Corian, Staron, Hi-Macs | Seamless joins, non-porous, can be moulded, repairable by polishing | Fully legal, no restrictions |

**Important for scope documents:** The scope must specify the exact material type and product name. "Engineered stone" alone is insufficient — the scope should confirm the product is compliant with the national ban if applicable, or specify natural stone/sintered/porcelain.

## 2. Template and Measure

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.1 When Can Templating Happen?

Templating can only occur **after** all of the following are complete:

| Prerequisite | Detail | Why |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| **All base cabinets installed** | Cabinets must be in their final position, secured to walls and each other | Template measurements are taken from cabinet tops — any movement after template renders measurements invalid |
| **Cabinets levelled** | Cabinets must be levelled within 2mm across the full run | Stone cannot be shimmed more than 2mm; excessive unevenness must be corrected at cabinet level |
| **Cabinets structurally sound** | Fixed to wall, cross-braced, no flex or movement | Stone is rigid — any cabinet movement can crack benchtop or open joins |
| **Substrate installed** (if required) | 18mm MDF or plywood substrate fixed to cabinet tops with L-brackets | Required for any edge treatment thicker than 20mm (see Section 6) |
| **Sink model confirmed** | Exact brand, model number, and dimensions on hand | Cut-out size is model-specific; changing the sink after template means re-fabrication |
| **Cooktop model confirmed** | Exact brand, model number, cut-out template from manufacturer | Cut-out dimensions and clearances are model-specific |
| **Tap/mixer confirmed** | Exact model, number of holes required, hole diameter | Tap holes are drilled to specific diameters — typically 35mm but varies |
| **Any other fixtures confirmed** | Soap dispensers, water filter taps, pop-up power outlets | Each requires a specific cut-out or hole |

**Timing relative to other trades:**
- Templating must happen AFTER cabinetry is complete.
- Templating should happen BEFORE splashback tiling in most cases (the stone benchtop level establishes the starting point for the tiled splashback).
- If a stone splashback is being used instead of tiles, the stone benchtop and stone splashback are typically templated at the same time.

### 2.2 Template Methods

| Method | Description | Accuracy | Time |
|--------|-------------|----------|------|
| **Digital laser template** | A laser measuring device (e.g., Flexijet 3D, LT-2D3D) creates a precise digital file of the space. Measures wall contours, cabinet positions, level variations, and all dimensions. | 99.99% accuracy claimed | ~30 minutes for an average kitchen (~25 m2) with one person |
| **Physical MDF template** | Thin MDF strips are cut, positioned on cabinets, and taped/glued together to form a physical template that is transported back to the factory. | Good accuracy but dependent on skill | 1-2 hours for an average kitchen |

**Industry trend:** Digital laser templating is now the standard for most professional Australian stone fabricators. The digital file feeds directly into CNC waterjet or bridge saw systems, eliminating transcription errors.

### 2.3 What the Templater Checks On-Site

- Cabinet level (spirit/laser level — identifies high and low points)
- Wall squareness (walls are rarely perfectly square; the template captures actual wall contours)
- Exact distances between walls, returns, and ends
- Locations and dimensions of all cut-outs (sink, cooktop, tap holes)
- Edge profile selections and which edges receive which treatment
- Join/seam locations (discussed and agreed with homeowner on-site)
- Overhang dimensions (front lip, breakfast bar, island ends)
- Any scribing to walls required

### 2.4 What the Homeowner Must Have Ready

- All appliance specification sheets with cut-out dimensions
- Physical appliances on-site (or at minimum, confirmed model numbers)
- Edge profile selection confirmed
- Stone colour/slab confirmed (ideally the specific slab selected at the supplier's yard)
- Decisions on extras: drainer grooves, waterfall ends, window sills, stone splashback

## 3. Fabrication

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 3.1 Lead Time

| Stage | Typical Duration | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Template to fabrication start | 1-2 business days | Digital templates are sent to factory immediately |
| Fabrication | 5-8 business days | Dependent on complexity, material, and factory backlog |
| **Total: Template to installation** | **7-10 working days** (typical) | Some suppliers quote 5-7 days; complex jobs (waterfall, book-matching, multiple pieces) can extend to 14+ days |

**Factors that extend lead time:**
- Waterfall ends requiring vein matching
- Book-matching across multiple slabs
- Complex curved sections
- High-demand periods (spring/summer renovation season)
- Regional/rural locations (additional transport time)
- Material availability (specific slab needs to be sourced from supplier)

### 3.2 CNC Fabrication vs Hand Fabrication

| Aspect | CNC Fabrication | Hand Fabrication |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Process** | Computer-controlled waterjet, bridge saw, and router cut stone to exact digital template dimensions | Stonemason manually measures, marks, and cuts using handheld tools and guides |
| **Accuracy** | Sub-millimetre accuracy from digital template | Dependent on stonemason skill — typically within 1-2mm |
| **Edge profiles** | CNC routers produce consistent, repeatable edge profiles | Hand-profiled edges can have character but less consistency |
| **Cut-outs** | Perfect geometric cut-outs every time | Very good with experienced masons but slower |
| **Drainer grooves** | Precisely routed with consistent depth and programmed slope | Possible by hand but significantly more difficult to achieve consistent depth |
| **Speed** | Faster for standard jobs | Slower but may be faster for simple one-off modifications |
| **Industry standard** | The standard for all major Australian fabricators | Still used for on-site modifications, repairs, and small custom work |

**Key CNC capabilities relevant to scope:**
- Sink cut-outs (all types)
- Cooktop cut-outs
- Drainer grooves with programmed drainage slope
- Integrated sink bowls (carved from the slab)
- Specialised edge profiles
- Shower bases (bathroom applications)

### 3.3 What Affects Fabrication Complexity and Cost

| Factor | Impact on Cost | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Number of cut-outs** | Each cut-out adds cost | Sink, cooktop, tap holes, soap dispenser, power outlets |
| **Edge profile complexity** | Simple (pencil round, arris) cheapest; ornate profiles (ogee, dupont) most expensive | Laminated 40mm edges cost more than standard 20mm |
| **Waterfall ends** | Significant premium | Requires precise mitre cutting, vein matching, additional material |
| **Book-matching** | Premium | Selecting and cutting sequential slabs to create mirror-image patterns |
| **Curved sections** | Premium | CNC can handle curves but requires more programming and material |
| **Number of pieces** | More pieces = more joins, more edge finishing, more installation complexity | L-shaped and U-shaped kitchens inherently require multiple pieces |
| **Material type** | Natural stone (marble, granite) generally more expensive to fabricate than engineered alternatives | Hardness affects cutting time and tool wear |
| **Slab selection** | Premium slabs with dramatic veining cost more | Specific slab selection (choosing the exact slab at the yard) may carry a surcharge |

---

## 4. Standard Scope Items

### 4.1 Benchtop Supply (Material, Thickness, Colour)

**Confidence: HIGH**

A stone benchtop scope item for "supply" must specify all of the following:

| Specification | Options | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| **Material type** | Natural granite, natural marble, natural quartzite, sintered stone, porcelain, silica-free engineered stone, acrylic solid surface | Must be specific — "stone" alone is ambiguous |
| **Product/brand** | e.g., Caesarstone Mineral 5031 Statuario Maximus, Dekton Kelya, Smartstone Statuario Venato | Exact product code ensures correct material is supplied |
| **Colour/pattern** | Named colour from supplier's range | Supplier colour names vary; use exact supplier name |
| **Thickness** | 20mm (standard), 30mm (natural stone standard), 40mm (laminated), 60mm (double-laminated), 6-12mm (porcelain/sintered slim) | Impacts substrate requirements, edge options, and cost |
| **Finish** | Polished (high gloss), Honed (matte), Leathered/Brushed (textured) | Affects appearance, maintenance, and feel |
| **Approximate dimensions** | Linear metres of benchtop run, depth (standard 600mm, or deeper) | Used for quoting; exact dimensions come from template |

**Standard Australian benchtop depth:** 600mm, though 650mm and 700mm are increasingly common for deeper cabinetry.

**Standard Australian benchtop height:** 900mm from finished floor level to top of benchtop surface (inclusive of cabinet, substrate, and stone thickness).

### 4.2 Sink Cut-Out

**Confidence: HIGH**

The sink cut-out is one of the most critical scope items. Different sink mounting methods have different requirements:

| Mount Type | Cut-Out Description | Stone Requirements | Notes |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Undermount** | Cut-out in stone is flush with or slightly larger than the sink rim. Sink sits beneath the stone. Stone edge is exposed and visible. | Edges of cut-out must be polished. Minimum 6mm radius on upper edge of cut-out. Cut-out must be CNC-machined for precision. | Most popular in Australian renovations. Requires the sink to be recessed into the substrate (5mm clearance all directions). Sink is typically siliconed and clipped from below. |
| **Top-mount (drop-in)** | Cut-out is slightly smaller than the sink flange. Sink sits on top of the stone with a visible rim. | Cut-out edges do not need polishing (hidden by sink flange). Less precision required. | Less expensive cut-out. Easier to replace sink later. Less premium appearance. |
| **Flush-mount (integrated)** | Cut-out is precisely machined to match sink dimensions. Sink sits flush with the stone surface. | Requires very precise CNC machining. Rebate cut into stone to accept sink flange. | Premium option. Seamless appearance. Most expensive cut-out type. |
| **Integrated/carved** | Sink bowl is carved directly from the stone slab by CNC. No separate sink unit. | Requires thick slab or built-up stone. Extremely precise CNC work. | Available in some materials. Very premium. Less common in residential Australia. |

**Minimum clearance requirements for sink cut-outs:**

| Measurement | Minimum Distance |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Front edge of benchtop to cut-out | 80mm |
| Rear edge of benchtop to cut-out | 50mm |
| Between sink cut-out and tap hole | 35mm |
| Between cut-out and any join/seam | 60mm |
| Between cut-out and edge/end of stone | 60mm |

**Scope document must include:**
- Sink brand and model number
- Mount type (undermount, top-mount, flush-mount)
- Exact cut-out dimensions (from manufacturer spec sheet)
- Number of sinks (single, double, 1.5 bowl)
- Notes on edge polishing requirement (undermount)

### 4.3 Cooktop Cut-Out

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Cut-out to manufacturer template** | Every cooktop has specific cut-out dimensions published in its installation manual. The stonemason must cut to these exact specifications. |
| **Standard cooktop widths (Australia)** | 300mm, 600mm, 900mm (edge-to-edge). Actual cut-out is smaller than the overall cooktop dimension. |
| **Typical cut-out for 600mm cooktop** | Approximately 560mm x 490mm (varies by model) |
| **Minimum clearances** | 50mm from front edge of benchtop to cut-out. 50mm from rear edge to cut-out (electric). 200mm from rear edge to combustible splashback (gas). 600mm minimum clearance above burners/elements to overhead combustible materials. |
| **Support rails** | A rail/support must be installed on edges adjacent to hot plates, sinks, and dishwashers to prevent stone flexing or cracking |

**Scope document must include:**
- Cooktop brand and model number
- Cut-out dimensions (from manufacturer spec)
- Fuel type (gas, induction, ceramic) — affects clearance requirements
- Whether cooktop clips to stone or sits on a gasket/seal

### 4.4 Tap Hole Drilling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Specification | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Standard tap hole diameter** | 35mm (most common for standard mixer taps in Australia) |
| **Variations** | 25mm, 28mm, 32mm, 35mm, 40mm — depends on tap model |
| **Number of holes** | Single mixer = 1 hole. Separate hot/cold = 2 holes. Mixer + water filter tap = 2 holes. Mixer + soap dispenser = 2 holes. Complex setups = 3+ holes. |
| **Position** | Specified on template. Typically centred behind sink or offset. Must maintain 35mm minimum from sink cut-out edge. |
| **Drilling method** | Diamond core drill bit. Done in factory (CNC) or on-site during installation. |

**Scope document must include:**
- Tap brand and model number
- Number of tap holes
- Hole diameter required (check tap installation manual)
- Position relative to sink (centred, offset left/right, on side of sink)

### 4.5 Edge Profiles

**Confidence: HIGH**

Edge profiles define the visible finish on exposed benchtop edges. Not all edges receive the same profile — the scope must specify which edges get which treatment.

**Common edge profiles available in Australia:**

| Profile | Description | Visual | Cost | Durability | Best Suited To |
|---------|-------------|--------|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Pencil Round (Eased Edge)** | Slight rounding on top and bottom edges (~3mm radius) | Clean, minimal | Low (standard/included) | Good — rounded edges resist chipping | Contemporary/modern kitchens |
| **Arris (Square/Sharp)** | Square front edge with small bevels (~1-2mm) on top and bottom | Sharp, architectural | Low (standard/included) | Lower — sharp edges susceptible to chipping | Ultra-modern, minimalist |
| **Half Bullnose** | Half-rounded front edge with curved top transitioning to flat bottom | Soft, classic | Low-Medium | Very good — no sharp edges | Traditional/transitional kitchens |
| **Full Bullnose** | Continuous curve from top to bottom of edge | Fully rounded, safe | Medium | Excellent — no sharp edges at all | Family kitchens, high-traffic areas |
| **Lambs Tongue** | Similar to half bullnose but with slightly sharper definition | Elegant, classic | Medium | Good | Traditional/hamptons kitchens |
| **Bevel** | Angled cut on top edge (typically 45 degrees, 3-6mm) | Geometric, deliberate | Low-Medium | Good | Modern kitchens |
| **Ogee** | S-shaped curve combining concave and convex profiles | Ornate, decorative | High | Moderate — intricate shape can catch impacts | Traditional, ornate kitchens |
| **Dupont** | Step profile with curved transitions | Distinctive, layered | High | Moderate | Feature pieces, statement islands |
| **Mitre (for 40mm+)** | Two 20mm pieces joined at 45 degrees to create a thick edge appearance | Bold, substantial | High (extra material + labour) | Good if well-fabricated | Contemporary feature kitchens, waterfall ends |
| **Laminated (for 40mm+)** | Two pieces stacked and glued to create a thick edge | Bold, chunky | Medium-High (extra material) | Very good — strongest join type | Modern kitchens wanting a substantial look |

**Minimum edge radius:** All edges should have a minimum radius of 3-4mm on any edge profile, with 6mm radius recommended for added durability. Undermount sink cut-out upper edges must have a minimum 6mm radius.

**Thickness and edge profile relationship:**
- 20mm stone: Standard profiles available (pencil round, arris, half bullnose, bevel)
- 40mm appearance: Achieved by either mitred join or laminated edge. Mitred edges can only have pencil round profile. Laminated edges can have any profile.
- 60mm appearance: Double-laminated. Available on request.

**Which edges get profiled (scope must specify):**

| Edge Location | Typical Treatment |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Front edge (facing the user) | Selected profile — always profiled |
| Exposed side/end (no return wall) | Selected profile — always profiled |
| Edge against wall | Raw/flat — hidden by wall or splashback |
| Edge against appliance (e.g., fridge return) | May be raw or profiled depending on visibility |
| Island — all exposed sides | Selected profile on all visible edges |
| Breakfast bar front edge | Selected profile |
| Waterfall return bottom edge | Profiled or raw (sits on floor or against cabinet base) |

### 4.6 Waterfall Ends

**Confidence: HIGH**

A waterfall end is where the benchtop stone cascades vertically down the side of a cabinet or island, creating a continuous surface from horizontal to vertical.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Join type** | Mitred join at 45 degrees where horizontal meets vertical piece. Two pieces of stone are cut at precisely 45 degrees and bonded together. |
| **Vein matching** | The goal is to align the stone's veining/pattern so it appears to flow continuously around the corner. This requires selecting the right slab and cutting pieces from adjacent positions. Perfect matching depends on material — bold-veined stones show any mismatch more obviously. |
| **Book-matching** | For the most seamless waterfall appearance, consecutive slabs (or pieces from the same slab) are "opened like a book" so the pattern mirrors across the join. This is a premium service requiring careful slab selection. |
| **Structural considerations** | The mitre join is the weakest point. Some fabricators prefer a butt-join (one piece sits on top of the other at 90 degrees) for greater strength, though this creates a visible seam line rather than a seamless corner. Mitred joins don't allow for movement — if cabinetry shifts, the join can crack. |
| **Installation** | The vertical panel is typically siliconed and mechanically fixed. It must be perfectly plumb. The mitre joint is glued with colour-matched epoxy adhesive. |
| **Number of waterfall ends** | Must specify: one end, both ends, or wrap-around (three sides). |
| **Cost impact** | Significant premium — additional material (the vertical panel is a large piece of stone), precise mitre cutting, vein matching labour, and additional installation time. |
| **Bottom edge** | The vertical panel must be finished at the bottom — either flush with the cabinet base, sitting on the floor (with a small clearance), or finishing at a specific height. Bottom edge treatment must be specified. |

**Scope document must include:**
- Which end(s) have waterfall returns (left, right, both)
- Height of waterfall panel(s) — from benchtop edge to floor or to cabinet base
- Whether vein matching is required (and to what standard)
- Bottom edge profile and termination detail
- Whether the waterfall is full height (to floor) or partial (to bottom of cabinet)

### 4.7 Island Benchtop

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Separate piece** | An island benchtop is fabricated as a separate piece from the main kitchen run. It is templated, fabricated, and installed independently. |
| **Slab limitations** | Standard stone slabs are approximately 3000mm x 1400mm (varies by supplier). Linnstone offers "Mega Size" slabs at 3500mm x 2000mm. If the island exceeds slab dimensions, multiple pieces with joins are required. |
| **Joins on islands** | If the island is longer than the slab, a join is unavoidable. The join should be placed in a discreet location (e.g., aligned with the sink cut-out where it is less noticeable). Join placement must be discussed and approved by the homeowner. |
| **Island edge profiles** | An island typically has exposed edges on all four sides (or three sides if one side is against a wall). All exposed edges must be profiled. |
| **Waterfall ends on islands** | Very common. One or both ends of the island can have waterfall returns. See Section 4.6. |
| **Breakfast bar overhang** | Common on one side of the island (see Section 4.8). |
| **Services in island** | Sink, cooktop, tap holes, pop-up power — all potentially located in the island benchtop. Each requires cut-outs. |
| **Separate quotation** | Some fabricators quote island benchtops as a separate line item from the main kitchen run. |

### 4.8 Breakfast Bar Overhang

**Confidence: HIGH**

A breakfast bar overhang extends the benchtop beyond the cabinet face to allow seating underneath.

| Overhang Distance | Support Required | Who Supplies/Installs Support |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Up to 150mm** | No additional support required (stone self-supports from substrate) | N/A |
| **150mm-300mm** | Substrate support only — substrate extends to match overhang, supported by cabinet structure | Cabinetmaker/carpenter installs substrate |
| **300mm-500mm** | Steel brackets or metal support frame required underneath | **Typically the carpenter/cabinetmaker supplies and installs steel brackets.** The stonemason sets the stone on top. Some stone suppliers offer brackets as an add-on. |
| **500mm+** | Legs, columns, or structural panels required from benchtop to floor | Carpenter/cabinetmaker or specialist metalworker supplies and installs. Must be in place before stone template. |

**Steel bracket specifications (Australian market):**
- Solid steel flat bar: typically 10-12mm thick x 65-70mm wide
- Brackets extend through the cabinet carcass and run the full length of the overhang
- Typically spaced at 400-600mm centres along the overhang
- Must be installed by the cabinetmaker/carpenter BEFORE stone templating
- Brackets are installed using L-brackets screwed into cabinet carcass from beneath

**Scope document must include:**
- Overhang dimension (in mm)
- Whether support brackets are included in the stone scope or the carpentry/cabinet scope (must be explicitly allocated to avoid gaps)
- Edge profile on the overhanging edge
- Whether the underside of the overhang is polished or raw

### 4.9 Stone Splashback

**Confidence: HIGH**

A stone splashback uses the same (or complementary) stone material behind the benchtop instead of tiles or glass.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Height** | Typically from top of benchtop to underside of overhead cabinets (usually 500-600mm). Can also be a short upstand (50-100mm) instead of a full splashback. |
| **Thickness** | Usually 20mm (same as benchtop) or thinner panels (some sintered/porcelain products available in 6-12mm for splashback applications) |
| **Material matching** | Ideally from the same slab as the benchtop for consistent colour/veining. Specified at template stage. |
| **Cut-outs in splashback** | Power point cut-outs (by electrician, coordinated with stonemason), window reveals, and any other penetrations must be specified. |
| **Installation** | Silicone-adhered to wall. Must be installed after benchtop is in place. Some systems use mechanical fixings in addition to adhesive. |
| **Templating** | Templated at the same time as benchtop. Wall contours are captured (walls are rarely flat or plumb). |
| **Joins** | Splashbacks may require joins if the run is longer than the slab. Join placement to be agreed with homeowner. |

### 4.10 Stone Window Sill

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Application** | Replaces a standard timber or tile window sill above the kitchen benchtop with matching stone |
| **Depth** | Measured from window frame to front edge. Varies based on wall thickness and window position — typically 100-250mm. Must be measured during template. |
| **Thickness** | Usually 20mm (matching benchtop) or 30mm for natural stone |
| **Edge profile** | Front edge is profiled to match benchtop edge profile. Rear edge sits against window frame. Side edges may be profiled if exposed or raw if against a wall return. |
| **Integration** | May be a separate piece that butts against the benchtop splashback, or integrated into the splashback panel |
| **Clearance** | Allow approximately 40mm from top of cabinets/substrate to bottom of window sill (plus a few mm clearance) |

### 4.11 Installation

**Confidence: HIGH**

Stone benchtop installation is a specialist task performed by the stone fabricator's installation team. The scope for installation includes:

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Pre-installation level check** | Installer rechecks cabinet levels with spirit/laser level. Minor adjustments (shimming) up to 2mm are acceptable. If cabinets are out by more than 2mm, the cabinetmaker must correct before stone installation proceeds. |
| **Shimming** | Thin packing pieces (maximum 2mm) placed beneath benchtop at low points to achieve a level surface. Shims are typically plastic or composite. |
| **Adhesive/silicone bedding** | High-quality construction adhesive or translucent silicone sealant applied in a zig-zag or bead pattern on cabinet front and back rails and all contact points. Distributes weight and prevents movement. |
| **Stone placement** | Stone pieces are carefully lifted and lowered into position. Stone benchtops are extremely heavy (20mm engineered stone weighs approximately 50kg/m2; natural granite can be 75-80kg/m2). Typically requires 2-3 installers. |
| **Alignment and positioning** | Stone is aligned to wall contours, checked for level, and positioned with correct overhangs. |
| **Join assembly** | Where multiple pieces meet, colour-matched epoxy adhesive is applied to join faces. Pieces are clamped together tightly. Excess adhesive is cleaned off immediately. |
| **Securing** | Temporary weights or clamps hold stone in position until adhesive cures (typically 24 hours for full cure). |
| **Silicone perimeter seal** | Colour-matched silicone applied where stone meets walls, splashbacks, and other surfaces. This is both cosmetic and functional (prevents water ingress). |
| **Clean-up** | All surfaces cleaned of adhesive residue, silicone smears, and construction dust. |
| **Installation duration** | Typically 1-3 hours for a standard kitchen (one straight run with sink and cooktop cut-outs). Complex kitchens with island, waterfall, and multiple pieces: half to full day. |

### 4.12 Join/Seam Placement

**Confidence: HIGH**

Joins (seams) are an inevitable part of most stone benchtop installations. Their placement is both a structural and cosmetic consideration.

**When joins are required:**
- L-shaped or U-shaped kitchen runs (join at the corner/mitre)
- Benchtop runs longer than a single slab (~3000mm)
- Waterfall returns (mitre join at the corner)
- Where pieces must be separated for transport and access (doorways, stairwells)

**Join placement guidelines:**

| Guideline | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Minimum 2 metres apart** | Joins should be spaced at least 2 metres apart where possible |
| **Not through cut-outs** | Joins should not pass through or be immediately adjacent to sink or cooktop cut-outs |
| **Minimum 60mm from cut-outs** | Any join must be at least 60mm from any cut-out edge |
| **Discreet locations preferred** | Behind the sink (where visual attention is focused on the sink, not the stone) or at a natural transition point |
| **Join width** | 0-2mm for both natural and reconstituted stone, with a maximum variation of +1mm (per Australian Standards) |
| **Homeowner approval** | Join locations should be documented on plans and presented to the homeowner for approval before fabrication. Once cut, joins cannot be moved. |
| **Colour matching** | Join adhesive/filler is colour-matched to the stone. Lighter colours tend to hide joins better. Bold-veined stones will show joins more prominently regardless of how well they are executed. |

**Join types:**

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Butt joint** | Two pieces meet at 90 degrees with flat faces glued together | All stone types. Strongest. Visible as a line. |
| **Mitre joint** | Two pieces cut at 45 degrees and joined to create a seamless corner | Manufactured stone, waterfall returns. Creates the illusion of a continuous piece but is weaker. |
| **Laminated joint** | Two pieces stacked vertically and bonded | Creating thicker edge appearances (40mm, 60mm). Very strong. |

### 4.13 On-Site Polishing and Finishing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Task | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Seam polishing** | After joins are assembled on-site, the joint line is polished flush using diamond abrasive pads to match the surrounding surface finish. This is standard practice for quality installations. |
| **Edge touch-up** | Any minor chips or rough spots on profiled edges from transport/handling are polished on-site. |
| **Surface polishing** | Generally NOT required for factory-finished surfaces. Only relevant for natural stone that may need on-site honing or polishing adjustments. |
| **Repair polishing** | If the stone is chipped or scratched during installation, stonemasons can polish out minor damage on-site using graduated diamond abrasive pads and polishing compound. |
| **Sealing (natural stone only)** | Natural stone (marble, granite) requires sealing after installation. The stonemason or a specialist applies an impregnating sealer. Silica-free engineered stone and sintered stone typically do not require sealing. |

## 5. Additional/Optional Items

### 5.1 Drainer Grooves

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Description** | Shallow grooves routed into the stone surface adjacent to the sink to channel water back into the sink basin. Eliminates the need for a separate dish drainer or drainer tray. |
| **Groove depth** | Approximately 2-4mm deep. Shallow enough not to compromise structural integrity. |
| **Groove width** | Typically 10-15mm wide per groove |
| **Groove spacing** | Typically 20-30mm between grooves |
| **Drainage slope** | A slight fall (slope) toward the sink is programmed into the CNC to ensure water drains back to the sink. Typically 1-2mm fall over the length of the drainer area. |
| **Pattern** | Parallel lines running perpendicular to the sink edge (most common), or angled at 45 degrees. Number of grooves and extent of drainer area to be specified. |
| **Fabrication** | CNC-routed in the factory. Very difficult to achieve consistent results by hand. |
| **Position** | Specified on template — typically on one or both sides of the sink, within 50-100mm of the sink cut-out. |
| **Cost** | Additional item — typically quoted per side (left drainer, right drainer, or both). |

### 5.2 Pop-Up Power Cut-Outs

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Description** | A circular or rectangular cut-out in the benchtop to accept a pop-up power outlet unit that sits flush when retracted and pops up when needed. |
| **Typical cut-out diameter** | Approximately 100-120mm for circular pop-up units (check specific product specs). Rectangular units have specific dimensions per product. |
| **Position** | Usually on the island benchtop or main run, away from water sources. Minimum distances from sink and cooktop must be maintained. |
| **Electrical work** | The electrical connection is done by a licensed electrician — NOT by the stonemason. The stonemason only provides the cut-out. Electrical work must comply with AS/NZS 3000:2018 (Australian Wiring Rules). |
| **Coordination** | The pop-up unit model must be confirmed before template so the correct cut-out size is specified. The electrician must run cabling to the cut-out location before benchtop installation. |

### 5.3 Soap Dispenser Hole

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Description** | A hole drilled through the benchtop to accept a built-in soap or detergent dispenser, with the pump head sitting on the benchtop surface and the bottle hanging below. |
| **Typical hole diameter** | 30-35mm (approximately 1-1/4" to 1-3/8") — varies by dispenser model |
| **Position** | Typically behind or beside the sink, within easy reach. Must maintain 35mm minimum from sink cut-out edge. |
| **Specification** | Dispenser model must be confirmed before template/fabrication. |

### 5.4 Water Filter Tap Hole

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Description** | A separate hole for a dedicated water filter tap (e.g., Zip HydroTap, Billi, Puretec, or simple under-sink filter tap). |
| **Typical hole diameter** | 35mm (standard) but varies — Zip HydroTap may require a larger hole (up to 50mm) or a specific cut-out shape. |
| **Position** | Usually adjacent to the main mixer tap, behind or beside the sink. |
| **Coordination** | The plumber installs the filter unit under the sink and connects the tap. The stonemason provides the hole. Tap model must be confirmed before template. |
| **Note for Zip/Billi** | These units may require additional cut-outs or clearances (ventilation grilles in cabinet below, larger hole for multi-function taps). Check manufacturer specs. |

### 5.5 Recessed Draining Board

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Description** | A more substantial drainage area compared to simple grooves — a section of the benchtop is recessed (lowered) by 3-5mm to create a shallow basin that channels water to the sink. May include grooves within the recessed area. |
| **Depth of recess** | 3-5mm below the main benchtop surface |
| **Drainage slope** | Programmed into CNC — gentle fall toward the sink |
| **Size** | Varies — typically 300-500mm wide x 400-600mm deep (adjacent to sink) |
| **Fabrication** | CNC-routed. More complex than simple grooves. |
| **Edge transition** | The edge where the recess meets the main benchtop surface must be smoothly radiused (no sharp step that could catch or chip). |
| **Cost** | Premium item — more CNC time and programming than standard drainer grooves. |

### 5.6 Hob/Upstand Panel Behind Cooktop

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Description** | A piece of stone that wraps up behind the cooktop (between the benchtop surface and the splashback or range hood). Creates a seamless stone surface behind the cooking area. Sometimes called an "upstand" though an upstand can also refer to a small 50-100mm lip. |
| **Height** | Short upstand: 50-100mm. Full hob panel: from benchtop to rangehood or overhead cabinets (500-600mm+). |
| **Clearance requirements** | Electric/induction cooktops: minimum 50mm clearance from rear of cooktop to non-combustible splashback surface. Gas cooktops: minimum 200mm clearance from rear of cooktop to combustible splashback (stone is non-combustible but check local regulations). |
| **Installation** | Silicone-adhered to wall, similar to splashback. May require mechanical fixings for larger/heavier panels. |
| **Templating** | Templated at the same time as benchtop. The hob panel contours must account for power/gas connections emerging from the wall. |

---

## 6. Substrate Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH**

The substrate is the supporting board (typically 18mm MDF or plywood) that sits on top of the cabinet carcasses, beneath the stone benchtop. It provides a continuous, flat support surface.

| Stone Thickness | Substrate Required? | Substrate Specification |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **20mm (standard)** | Not always — but recommended. If no substrate, back-to-front support rails must be fabricated every 600mm and installed along the perimeter of cut-outs larger than 600mm. | 18mm MDF or moisture-resistant MDF (MR MDF). |
| **40mm laminated edge** | Yes — mandatory | 18mm MDF, offset 45mm from each exposed edge (to allow for the laminated strip beneath) |
| **40mm mitred edge** | Yes — mandatory, and thicker | 26mm substrate (8mm thicker than standard 18mm, to account for mitre geometry) |
| **Natural stone (30mm)** | Recommended for additional support | 18mm MDF or plywood |

**Substrate installation details:**
- Installed by the cabinetmaker/carpenter (NOT the stonemason) — must be complete before stone template
- Fixed to cabinet carcasses using L-brackets screwed from beneath (allows stone and substrate to be removed without damaging carcasses)
- Cut-outs for sinks, cooktops, tap holes, and waste holes must be made in the substrate before stone installation
- Undermount sinks must be recessed into the substrate, with 5mm clearance in all directions
- Support rails must be installed on edges adjacent to hot plates, sinks, and dishwashers

**Who supplies the substrate?**
- In most cases, the cabinetmaker/carpenter supplies and installs the substrate as part of the cabinet package.
- Some stone fabricators include substrate in their scope — this must be clarified in the quotation to avoid double-ups or gaps.

## 7. Coordination with Other Trades

**Confidence: HIGH**

Stone benchtop installation requires careful coordination with multiple trades. The scope document should clarify responsibilities:

| Trade | Coordination Point | Timing |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| **Cabinetmaker/Carpenter** | Cabinets installed and levelled. Substrate installed. Overhang support brackets installed. All must be complete BEFORE stone template. | Before template |
| **Plumber** | Rough-in complete (water supply and waste pipes in position). Sink and tap models confirmed. Plumber returns AFTER stone installation to connect sink, taps, and waste. Undermount sinks may need to be fitted before or during stone installation (varies by installer). | Rough-in before template; fit-off after stone install |
| **Electrician** | Rough-in complete (power points, cooktop connection, rangehood connection). Pop-up power unit cabling in position. Electrician returns AFTER stone installation to connect cooktop and any power outlets. | Rough-in before template; fit-off after stone install |
| **Tiler** | If tiled splashback: tiling happens AFTER stone installation (tiles start from the top of the stone). If stone splashback: no tiler involvement for that area. | After stone install |
| **Painter** | Walls behind the benchtop and splashback area should be painted (or at least primed) before stone installation, particularly if no splashback covers the wall. | Before stone install (ideally) |
| **Gas Fitter** | If gas cooktop: gas connection point must be in position before template. Gas fitter connects after stone installation. | Rough-in before template; connection after stone install |

## 8. Australian Standards and Regulatory Notes

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Standard/Regulation | Relevance |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Model WHS Regulations (July 2024)** | Prohibit manufacture, supply, processing, and installation of engineered stone containing >1% crystalline silica. Scope documents must only specify compliant materials. |
| **Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 — Reg 5M (January 2025)** | Prohibit import of non-compliant engineered stone. |
| **AS/NZS 3000:2018 (Wiring Rules)** | All electrical work near/in stone benchtops (pop-up power, cooktop connections) must comply. Unlicensed electrical work voids warranties and violates safety regulations. |
| **Building Code of Australia (BCA/NCC)** | Joint width tolerances: 0-2mm with maximum variation of +1mm. General construction quality standards apply. |
| **Legacy engineered stone** | Engineered stone already installed before the ban does NOT need to be removed. It is considered safe as long as it remains undisturbed. However, any modification (cutting, drilling, polishing) of legacy engineered stone is prohibited under the ban. |
| **Cooktop clearances** | Minimum clearances from cooktop to combustible materials are specified in AS/NZS 5601.1 (gas) and appliance manufacturer requirements. |
