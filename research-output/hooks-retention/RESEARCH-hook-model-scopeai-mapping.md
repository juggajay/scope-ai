# Hook Model Mapping: ScopeAI User Journey

**Date:** February 2026
**Depends on:** PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, Wizard Implementation Spec
**Purpose:** Map Nir Eyal's four Hook phases to ScopeAI's actual user journey with actionable implementation recommendations.

---

## Preamble: Why the Hook Model Needs Adaptation for ScopeAI

The Hook Model was popularised through high-frequency, low-stakes products (Instagram, Slack, games). ScopeAI is the inverse:

| Dimension | Typical Hook Product | ScopeAI |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Use frequency | Daily / hourly | 1-5 visits total |
| Stakes | Low (entertainment) | High ($15K-$150K renovation) |
| Emotional driver | Boredom, FOMO | Anxiety, fear of being ripped off |
| "Habit" we want | Daily return | Funnel completion, second room, referral |
| Value delivery | Ongoing (content feed) | One session (wizard to download) |

This means we are not building a habit loop in the Eyal sense. We are building a **confidence engine** -- each phase of the Hook should reduce anxiety and build conviction, not create compulsive checking behaviour.

The "habit" for ScopeAI is: **when an Australian homeowner thinks "renovation", ScopeAI is the first thing that comes to mind.** That is the internal trigger we are creating.

---

## Phase 1: TRIGGERS

### 1.1 External Triggers (What Brings Them In)

#### ET-1: SEO Landing (Primary acquisition channel)

- **What:** User searches "kitchen renovation scope template australia" or "how to compare builder quotes" and lands on marketing page or SEO guide.
- **Why:** 78% of homeowners exceed budget. They search for solutions before calling tradies. Long-tail renovation queries have low competition in AU.
- **Where:** Landing page (`app/(marketing)/page.tsx`), SEO content pages (`/guides/*`)
- **How:** Hero copy must immediately validate the internal trigger: "Stop getting quotes you can't compare." The CTA "Start My Scope -- Free Preview" promises value before commitment. Each SEO guide ends with a contextual CTA: "Ready to create your [kitchen] scope? It takes under 10 minutes."
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('landing_page_view', { source: utm_source })` -- track which search terms convert highest. Target: 3%+ visitor-to-wizard-start.

#### ET-2: Friend/Family Recommendation (Word-of-mouth)

- **What:** Homeowner tells another homeowner "I used this thing called ScopeAI and my quotes finally made sense."
- **Why:** Renovation is inherently social. Homeowners ask friends for tradie recommendations constantly. A tool recommendation follows the same channel.
- **Where:** Post-purchase scope view (`components/scope/ScopeHeader.tsx`), email delivery, PDF footer
- **How:** After payment, show a share prompt: "Know someone renovating? Send them your recommendation." Provide a personal referral link. On the PDF footer: "This scope was generated by ScopeAI.com.au -- Get comparable renovation quotes in under 10 minutes." Every PDF a tradie receives is a passive referral channel.
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('referral_link_shared', { method: 'copy' | 'email' | 'sms' })` -- target 20%+ share rate among paid users.

#### ET-3: Tradie Referral (B2B2C loop)

- **What:** Tradie receives a ScopeAI-generated scope from a homeowner. Impressed by the quality, they recommend it to other clients: "Before you call me, go generate a scope on ScopeAI so I can give you an accurate quote."
- **Why:** Tradies benefit from better-scoped projects (fewer disputes, clearer pricing). A well-scoped job is faster to quote and less likely to blow out.
- **Where:** PDF branding (`components/scope/` PDF templates), potential tradie-facing landing page (V2)
- **How:** PDF watermark on every page: "Generated by ScopeAI.com.au". Include a tradie-specific tagline on the cover page: "This scope was created so you can provide an accurate, comparable quote." V2: Create `/for-tradies` landing page explaining benefits of recommending ScopeAI to clients.
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('scope_pdf_downloaded')` with `tradeType` -- track PDF distribution volume as proxy. V2: track `/for-tradies` page visits and `?ref=tradie` conversions.

#### ET-4: "Your Scope is Waiting" Re-engagement Email

- **What:** User started wizard but didn't complete. 24 hours later, email: "Your [kitchen] scope is 70% ready. Pick up where you left off."
- **Why:** Wizard state is persisted in localStorage (Steps 0-3) and Convex (Step 4+). The user already invested time uploading photos and answering questions. That sunk cost is the leverage.
- **Where:** Convex action (`convex/email.ts`), triggered by a scheduled function checking `projects` with `status: "draft"` and `_creationTime > 24h ago`.
- **How:** Email includes: (1) project type and suburb they entered, (2) photo count they uploaded, (3) "Continue where you left off" deep link to `/create?step=N` with their session. Subject line: "Your kitchen renovation scope is almost ready, [name]." Do NOT include pricing or urgency language -- just remind them of their progress.
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('reengagement_email_sent', { step_abandoned: N })` and `posthog.capture('reengagement_email_clicked')`. Target: 15%+ click-through, 5%+ complete-to-payment.

#### ET-5: "Second Room" Post-Purchase Prompt

- **What:** After user downloads their kitchen scope, prompt: "Planning to renovate your bathroom too? Your property details are already saved -- start in under 5 minutes."
- **Why:** Multi-room renovations are common. The user's property details, auth, and trust are already established. Friction for the second room is drastically lower.
- **Where:** Account dashboard (`app/account/page.tsx`), post-download moment in scope view, follow-up email 7 days after purchase.
- **How:** Dashboard shows completed projects with a "+ Add Another Room" card. The card lists remaining project types with pre-filled property details. Email 7 days post-purchase: "How's the [kitchen] renovation planning going? When you're ready, your bathroom scope starts with your details already filled in."
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('second_room_prompt_shown')` and `posthog.capture('second_room_started')`. Target: 10%+ of paid users start a second room within 30 days.

### 1.2 Internal Triggers (Emotional States That Drive Action)

#### IT-1: Budget Anxiety ("I don't want to get ripped off")

- **What:** The primary emotional driver. 78% of homeowners exceed budget. The fear of hidden costs, surprise variations, and tradie quotes that don't add up.
- **Why:** This is the strongest internal trigger because it is universal and persistent. Every time the homeowner thinks about their renovation budget, the anxiety surfaces.
- **Where:** Landing page hero copy, mode selection descriptions, scope preview trade count reveal
- **How:** Copy must name the anxiety directly: "78% of renovations go over budget. Yours doesn't have to." Do NOT exploit the anxiety (no countdown timers, no "act now" urgency). Instead, position ScopeAI as the antidote: "A detailed scope means every tradie quotes the same thing. No surprises." The scope preview showing 7 trades and 53 items implicitly says "look at everything you would have missed."
- **Measure:** Landing page conversion rate segments by entry keyword (budget-related vs general renovation queries). Track `posthog.capture('wizard_started', { landing_keyword_category })`.

#### IT-2: Overwhelm ("I don't know where to start")

- **What:** First-time renovators feel paralysed. They don't know construction terminology, don't know which trades they need, don't know what order things happen in.
- **Why:** This trigger drives the initial search that leads to SEO discovery. It is also what the wizard directly solves -- each step replaces uncertainty with structure.
- **Where:** Wizard question flow (`components/create/questions/QuestionFlow.tsx`), sequencing plan output
- **How:** The wizard itself IS the overwhelm-reducer. Question intro screen: "12 quick questions about your kitchen. Most people finish in under 2 minutes." Each question replaces a knowledge gap with a confident choice. The sequencing plan output is the ultimate overwhelm antidote: "Here's exactly what order your trades need to happen in." Post-purchase, show a "What to do next" guide on the scope view.
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('question_flow_completed', { time_seconds, questions_answered })`. Track time-per-question and "Not sure" selection rate as proxy for overwhelm level.

#### IT-3: Comparison Frustration ("These quotes are all different")

- **What:** User already has 2-3 quotes that cover different things. They cannot compare them. This triggers a search for a solution.
- **Why:** This is the trigger that has the highest purchase intent. Users with this frustration have already committed to renovating -- they just need a comparison framework.
- **Where:** SEO guides (`/guides/how-to-compare-builder-quotes`), landing page "How It Works" section, scope preview showing exclusions
- **How:** Landing page should have a section: "Why your quotes don't match" with a visual comparing three quotes with different line items, then showing a ScopeAI scope that standardises them. The scope output explicitly lists exclusions -- this is the key insight that resolves comparison frustration.
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('landing_section_viewed', { section: 'comparison_problem' })`. Track conversion rate from comparison-focused SEO pages vs general pages.

#### IT-4: Social Pressure ("I don't want to look stupid in front of the tradie")

- **What:** Homeowners feel intimidated by tradies who use jargon. They worry about asking the wrong questions or accepting a bad quote because they don't understand it.
- **Why:** The scope document transforms the power dynamic. Walking in with a professional document that references AS/NZS standards makes the homeowner feel credible.
- **Where:** Scope output compliance notes, tooltip explanations, PDF professional formatting
- **How:** Every technical term in the scope has a tooltip explanation (PRD requirement SQ-09). The PDF is formatted to look like it came from a project manager, not a homeowner. Include a "How to use this scope" cover page: "Hand this to your tradie and ask them to quote against each line item." This turns the homeowner from "I don't know what to ask" to "Quote against these 11 items."
- **Measure:** NPS survey question: "How confident do you feel sharing this scope with tradies?" (1-10 scale). Target: 8+ average.

### 1.3 Re-engagement Triggers (What Brings Completed Users Back)

#### RE-1: Renovation Progress Check-in

- **What:** Email 30 days after purchase: "How's the [kitchen] renovation going? Your scope is always available in your account."
- **Why:** During active renovation, users may want to reference their scope (check sequencing, verify items with tradies). This keeps ScopeAI in their awareness.
- **Where:** Scheduled email via Convex action + Resend
- **How:** Simple, helpful email. No upsell. Just: "Your scope is here: [link]. If you're planning another room, your property details are saved." Include a feedback prompt: "How accurate was your scope? [Quick survey link]"
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('checkin_email_opened')` and `posthog.capture('scope_revisit', { days_since_purchase })`.

#### RE-2: Seasonal Renovation Prompts

- **What:** Email in spring (September-October in AU): "Renovation season is here. Planning another room?"
- **Why:** Renovation activity in Australia peaks in spring and early summer. Timing re-engagement with natural renovation cycles increases relevance.
- **Where:** Scheduled email to all users with at least one paid project
- **How:** Once per year maximum. Include: (1) their previous project summary, (2) remaining room types, (3) "Start in under 5 minutes with your saved details." Keep it brief and respectful of frequency.
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('seasonal_email_clicked')` and subsequent `wizard_started` events.

---

## Phase 2: ACTION

The action is the simplest behaviour done in anticipation of reward. For ScopeAI, we need to identify the minimum action at each funnel stage and systematically reduce friction.

### 2.1 First Visit: Start the Wizard

- **What:** Click "Start My Scope" on the landing page.
- **Why:** This is the lowest-commitment entry point. No signup required. No payment mentioned yet. The CTA copy explicitly says "Free Preview" to eliminate risk perception.
- **Where:** Landing page hero CTA (`app/(marketing)/page.tsx`)
- **How:** Button is `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` (teal), large touch target, above the fold on mobile. No form fields on the landing page -- just one button. The word "free" in the CTA is critical: "Start My Scope -- Free Preview." Below the button, a trust line: "No credit card required. See your scope before you pay."
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('wizard_started', { source: 'hero' | 'how_it_works' | 'pricing' })`. Target: 25%+ of landing page visitors click.

**Friction reducers:**
- No account creation required to start (Steps 0-3 are anonymous)
- Single button, no choices to make on landing page
- "Free Preview" removes payment anxiety
- Mobile-optimised hero (60%+ traffic is mobile)

### 2.2 Mid-Funnel: Complete Photos + Questions

- **What:** Upload 3-10 photos and answer 8-12 tap-to-select questions.
- **Why:** This is where 40-60% of users will drop off. Every additional field is friction. But photos and answers are essential for scope quality. The challenge is making this feel fast and effortless.
- **Where:** Steps 2-3 of wizard (`PhotoUpload.tsx`, `QuestionFlow.tsx`)
- **How:**
  - **Photos:** Camera-first on mobile (two taps: "Take Photo" then snap). Upload starts immediately on selection (no "upload" button). Per-file progress ring on thumbnails. Counter uses progress framing: "2 of 3 minimum" then "3 photos added -- nice!"
  - **Questions:** One question per screen with auto-advance. 12 questions feel like 12 taps, not a form. Progress bar front-loaded so users hit 50% by mid-questions. "Not sure yet" always available (removes decision anxiety).
  - **Wizard footer:** Persistent Back/Continue. Continue disabled until step is valid. No ambiguity about what to do next.
  - **Progress psychology:** Endowed progress (bar starts at 5%). Weighted to front-load perceived progress. Phase labels ("Your Space", "Your Plans") chunk the journey into 4 manageable phases.

- **Measure:** Step-to-step progression: `posthog.capture('wizard_step_completed', { step, time_seconds })`. Key metric: Step 2 (photos) to Step 3 (questions) drop-off rate. Target: <30% drop-off at any single step.

**Friction reducers:**
- Auto-advance on single-select questions (no "Next" tap per question)
- Photo analysis runs in background during questions (no wait)
- "Not sure yet" on every question (removes decision paralysis)
- Progress bar shows clear momentum
- Tips panel collapses after first photo (reduces cognitive load)

### 2.3 Conversion: Pay for the Scope

- **What:** Select pricing tier and complete Stripe Checkout.
- **Why:** This is the highest-friction moment. User must exchange money for a product they haven't fully seen. The preview must build enough conviction that payment feels like unlocking value they already own, not buying something new.
- **Where:** Step 6: ScopePreview (`components/create/ScopePreview.tsx`), Stripe Checkout redirect
- **How:**
  - **Preview reveals just enough:** Trade names + icons, item counts per trade, 1-2 sample items per trade. The sample items must be the most impressive ones (compliance items, specific specifications). Item count is the curiosity driver: "53 scope items across 7 trades" makes the user think "what are the other 51?"
  - **Pricing tier highlight:** Professional ($99) is "Most Popular" with visual emphasis. Starter ($49) is positioned as "simple renovation" and Premium ($149) as "complex/heritage". The $99 tier should feel like the natural choice.
  - **Trust signals at payment moment:** "Money-back guarantee", "Based on Australian Standards", Stripe secure payment badge. These appear directly adjacent to the payment button.
  - **Stripe Checkout:** Hosted page (not embedded). Reduces PCI scope and builds trust via recognisable Stripe UI.

- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('pricing_tier_selected', { tier })` and `posthog.capture('payment_completed', { tier, amount })`. Target: 30%+ of users who see preview convert to payment. Track tier distribution.

**Friction reducers:**
- Stripe Checkout (trusted, familiar, fast)
- "Money-back guarantee" removes risk
- Preview shows enough quality to validate the purchase
- No additional form fields between preview and payment
- Success redirect goes directly to full scope (instant gratification)

### 2.4 Post-Purchase: Download and Send to Tradies

- **What:** View full scopes, toggle items, download PDFs, email to tradies.
- **Why:** This is where the product delivers on its promise. The post-purchase experience determines NPS, referral likelihood, and second-room probability. If this moment doesn't feel like "wow, this was worth $99", the user will not refer and will not return.
- **Where:** Full scope view (`app/scope/[projectId]/page.tsx`), PDF download, email delivery
- **How:**
  - **Immediate access:** Payment success redirects to `/scope/{projectId}`. No email wait. No "processing". Full scope loads instantly from Convex reactive query.
  - **Tabbed interface:** One tab per trade. User sees the depth of each scope immediately. Categories group items logically. Compliance notes and exclusions appear per-trade.
  - **Toggle items:** Checkbox on every scope item. Unchecking removes from PDF. This customisation is the "investment" phase (see Phase 4).
  - **Download:** "Download All" generates fresh PDF from current state. Individual trade PDFs also available. ZIP bundle for Trade Manager mode.
  - **Email to tradies:** "Email this scope" sends PDF to an email address. Subject line pre-filled: "[Kitchen] Scope of Works -- Please Quote Against These Items."
  - **"What to do next" guide:** Brief card after first scope view: "1. Review each trade scope. 2. Toggle off items you don't need. 3. Download and send to 3 tradies. 4. Compare their quotes line by line."

- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('scope_viewed', { projectId, tradeType })`, `posthog.capture('scope_item_toggled', { action: 'exclude' | 'include' })`, `posthog.capture('pdf_downloaded', { type: 'individual' | 'zip' })`, `posthog.capture('scope_emailed_to_tradie')`. Target: 80%+ of paid users download at least one PDF within 24 hours.

### 2.5 Return: Start a Second Room

- **What:** User returns to create a scope for their bathroom (or other room).
- **Why:** Multi-room purchases are the primary revenue multiplier in a one-time-purchase model. Each additional room costs the user less effort (property details saved) and costs ScopeAI the same to generate.
- **Where:** Account dashboard (`app/account/page.tsx`), post-purchase prompts
- **How:**
  - **Dashboard shows completed projects:** Each project shows trade count, date, and status. A prominent "+ Add Another Room" card sits alongside completed projects.
  - **Pre-filled property details:** When starting a second scope, suburb, state, property type, and year built auto-populate from their first project. Mode selection may also default to their previous choice.
  - **Contextual timing:** Don't prompt for second room immediately after purchase. Wait 7 days (email) or show on next dashboard visit. The user needs time to act on their first scope.

- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('second_room_started', { previous_project_type, new_project_type })`. Target: 10%+ of paid users purchase a second room within 90 days.

---

## Phase 3: VARIABLE REWARD

Variable reward is what keeps users engaged because they cannot fully predict the outcome. In ScopeAI, the AI-generated scope IS the variable reward -- users cannot predict what trades they need, what items will appear, or what compliance issues apply to their specific property.

### 3.1 The Scope Itself Is the Primary Variable Reward

- **What:** Every scope is unique. A 1985 house in Paddington gets different items than a 2015 apartment in Docklands. The user doesn't know what a "proper" electrical scope looks like until they see one generated for their exact situation.
- **Why:** Nir Eyal's "reward of the self" -- the scope makes the user feel competent. They go from "I don't know what I don't know" to "I have a professional document with 53 specific items." The variability comes from the AI's project-specific analysis.
- **Where:** Scope generation, scope view, PDF output
- **How:** Ensure every scope feels specific, not generic. Photo analysis findings should appear in scope items (e.g., "Existing gas connection identified -- new induction cooktop requires dedicated 32A circuit and gas decommission"). Property age flags should surface (e.g., "Pre-1990 property -- asbestos inspection required before any demolition"). State-specific compliance should be explicit (e.g., "NSW: Certificate of Compliance required under Fair Trading Regulation").
- **Measure:** Scope quality proxy: `posthog.capture('scope_item_count', { total_items, trade_count })`. Track variation across projects. If all kitchens get identical scopes, the reward isn't variable enough.

### 3.2 "Aha Moment" Discoveries

These are the moments where the user learns something they didn't know they didn't know. These are ScopeAI's most powerful conversion and retention drivers.

#### Aha-1: Trades They Didn't Know They Needed

- **What:** User thinks they need a plumber and electrician. Scope reveals they also need waterproofing, structural engineering (for wall removal), stone benchtop fabrication, and a demolition crew.
- **Why:** This is the moment the user thinks "I would have missed all of this." It validates the purchase before they even pay.
- **Where:** Scope preview trade list (Step 6), full scope trade tabs
- **How:** Preview should emphasise unexpected trades. Show trade count prominently: "Your kitchen renovation requires 7 specialist trades." Include a subtle note: "Most homeowners only think of 2-3." The preview ordering should put the most surprising trades first (not demolition -- everyone expects that -- but waterproofing or structural).
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('preview_viewed', { trade_count, expected_trades })`. Post-purchase survey: "Were any of these trades a surprise to you?"

#### Aha-2: Compliance Items They Had No Idea About

- **What:** "All electrical work must comply with AS/NZS 3000. Certificate of Compliance (CCEW) required on completion." Or: "Waterproofing membrane must be inspected before tiling can begin."
- **Why:** These items make the scope feel authoritative and professional. The user thinks "this is what a project manager would know." Compliance items are also the strongest argument for why tradies should take the scope seriously.
- **Where:** `ScopeWarnings.tsx`, `ScopeExclusions.tsx`, compliance notes per trade
- **How:** Compliance items should be visually distinct -- use an icon or badge. Group them under a "Compliance & Standards" section per trade. Each reference should include the full standard name and a plain-English explanation (PRD Insight 3).
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('compliance_note_expanded', { standard_ref })`. Track which compliance items users interact with most.

#### Aha-3: Photo Analysis Findings

- **What:** AI analyses photos and identifies things the homeowner didn't notice: water damage staining, outdated electrical (no visible RCDs), asbestos-era materials, gas connection that needs decommissioning.
- **Why:** This is the most personal variable reward. The AI "saw" their specific kitchen and found real issues. It feels like getting a professional inspection for free.
- **Where:** Photo analysis results fed into scope generation context. Should be surfaced in scope warnings and notes.
- **How:** When the photo analysis identifies condition flags (water_damage, outdated_electrical, asbestos_era_materials), these should appear as warnings in the relevant trade scope. Example: "Photo analysis identified potential water damage near sink area -- plumber should inspect drain connections before proceeding." The preview could include: "We identified 3 potential issues from your photos."
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('photo_analysis_finding_count', { count, flags: [...] })`. Track correlation between finding count and payment conversion.

### 3.3 Preview as Curiosity Engine

- **What:** The preview reveals just enough to create an information gap. Trade names + item counts + 1-2 sample items.
- **Why:** George Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory: when we know some but not all, curiosity is maximised. Showing 2 of 53 items creates a powerful "what are the other 51?" drive.
- **Where:** ScopePreview component (Step 6)
- **How:**
  - Show trade names with icons (visual) + item counts (quantitative) + 1 sample item per trade (qualitative proof)
  - The sample item should be the most impressive/specific one (not "Remove existing fixtures" but "Install 8x IC-4 rated dimmable downlights, 3000K warm white, IP44 in wet areas")
  - Show total: "53 scope items across 7 trades"
  - Show what else is locked: "Sequencing plan (15 phases), Coordination checklist, PC sum allowances, Compliance references"
  - Do NOT blur content. Content is simply not shown. The paywall is clean: "Unlock your full scope."
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('preview_to_payment_conversion', { trade_count, total_items })`. Track whether higher item counts correlate with higher conversion. Target: 30%+ preview-to-payment.

### 3.4 Personalisation as Reward Amplifier

- **What:** Every element of the scope should feel like it was written for THIS user's specific situation, not a template.
- **Why:** Generic output kills variable reward. If a user's friend got the same scope for a different kitchen, the perceived value drops to zero.
- **Where:** Throughout scope generation (Gemini prompts), scope display
- **How:**
  - Scope items reference user's specific answers: "Induction cooktop selected -- new dedicated 32A circuit required (upgrading from existing gas connection)"
  - Property details appear in scope header: "Kitchen Renovation Scope -- 42 Glenmore Road, Paddington NSW -- 1985 Property"
  - Photo analysis findings are woven into trade-specific items, not just listed as generic warnings
  - PC sum ranges adjusted to their quality tier selection
  - State-specific compliance references use their actual state
- **Measure:** Qualitative: NPS survey asking "How personalised did your scope feel?" (1-10). Quantitative: track answer-reference density in scope items.

---

## Phase 4: INVESTMENT

Investment is what the user puts into the product that (a) makes it more valuable to them over time, and (b) increases the likelihood they return. For ScopeAI, investment operates differently from social media (no content creation, no social graph). The investments are data, customisation, and social commitment.

### 4.1 Data Investment (Photos, Answers, Property Details)

- **What:** Users upload 3-10 photos, answer 8-12 questions, enter property details, and create an account. This data represents effort they don't want to repeat.
- **Why:** Sunk cost drives completion. Once a user has uploaded 5 photos and answered 8 questions, abandoning feels wasteful. This same data makes the second room dramatically easier (property details pre-filled).
- **Where:** Wizard Steps 1-4, account creation
- **How:**
  - Progress bar makes invested effort visible ("You're 65% there")
  - Navigation guard on abandonment: "Your progress has been saved. You can resume where you left off."
  - For returning users, pre-fill everything possible: property details, mode preference, account info
  - Show invested data on dashboard: "3 projects, 22 photos uploaded, 36 questions answered"
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('wizard_abandoned', { step, photos_uploaded, questions_answered })`. Track correlation between photos uploaded and completion rate.

### 4.2 Customisation Investment (Scope Item Toggles)

- **What:** Users toggle scope items on/off to customise their scope. They might exclude items they plan to DIY, or include custom items they add manually.
- **Why:** The IKEA effect -- people value things they've helped create more than identical pre-made things. A customised scope feels more "theirs" than a raw AI output. Customisation also creates switching cost: they can't easily replicate their customised scope elsewhere.
- **Where:** Full scope view (`ScopeItemToggle.tsx`), custom item addition, PDF reflects customisations
- **How:**
  - Toggle state persists via `updateScopeItem` Convex mutation
  - PDF always reflects current toggle state (included items only)
  - Show customisation stats: "You've customised 8 items in your scope"
  - Custom items are badged as "Added by you" (existing `isCustom` field on ScopeItem type)
  - On re-visit to scope view, show their customisations prominently: "Your customised scope -- 3 items excluded, 2 custom items added"
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('scope_customised', { items_excluded, items_added })`. Track correlation between customisation and referral rate. Hypothesis: users who customise are more likely to share.

### 4.3 Social Investment (Sending Scopes to Tradies)

- **What:** When a user emails their scope to a tradie, they've created an external commitment. They've told a professional "this is what I want" -- they can't easily walk that back.
- **Why:** Robert Cialdini's commitment and consistency principle. Once someone has publicly committed to a plan, they're more likely to follow through. Emailing scopes to tradies converts internal planning into external accountability.
- **Where:** Email-to-tradie flow, shareable links (V2)
- **How:**
  - Post-download, prompt: "Ready to send to your tradies? Email your scope directly."
  - Track how many tradies each scope is sent to
  - Follow up: "You sent your electrical scope to 3 electricians. Have you received quotes yet?" (V2)
  - The email subject line is pre-filled to position the homeowner as professional: "[Kitchen] Scope of Works -- Please Quote Against These Items"
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('scope_emailed_to_tradie', { trade_type, tradie_count })`. Target: 40%+ of paid users email at least one scope to a tradie.

### 4.4 Account & Dashboard as Stored Value

- **What:** The account dashboard shows all past projects, their scopes, and download history. It becomes a renovation command centre.
- **Why:** Stored value creates a reason to return. Even if the user doesn't buy a second room, they may return to re-download a PDF, reference their sequencing plan during construction, or check a compliance requirement mid-renovation.
- **Where:** Account dashboard (`app/account/page.tsx`)
- **How:**
  - Show projects as cards: project type icon, suburb, date, trade count, payment tier
  - Each project links to full scope view (always accessible after payment)
  - Quick actions: "Download All PDFs", "Email Scope", "Start Another Room"
  - Show property details summary: serves as renovation notebook
  - V2: Add "Renovation Timeline" view that shows sequencing plan as an interactive calendar
- **Measure:** `posthog.capture('dashboard_visited', { days_since_last_purchase })`. Track return visit frequency and time-on-dashboard.

### 4.5 Investment Ladder (Progressive Commitment)

The investment phases should form a deliberate ladder where each step makes the next feel natural:

```
Step 0-1: Small investment (2 taps -- mode + project type)
    |
Step 2: Medium investment (photo upload -- 3-5 minutes)
    |
Step 3: Continued investment (12 question taps -- 2 minutes)
    |
Step 4: Identity investment (account creation -- "this is my project now")
    |
Step 5-6: Emotional investment (watching scope generate, seeing preview)
    |
Payment: Financial investment ($49-$149)
    |
Post-purchase: Customisation investment (toggles, custom items)
    |
Social investment: Sending to tradies (external commitment)
    |
Second room: Leveraging all prior investment (pre-filled, trusted)
```

- **What:** Each step increases commitment but also increases perceived value proportionally.
- **Why:** Foot-in-the-door effect. Asking for account creation on Step 0 would kill conversion. Asking for it on Step 4, after photos and questions, feels natural because the user has already invested.
- **Where:** Wizard flow sequencing (already designed correctly per ARCHITECTURE.md Section 5)
- **How:** The existing wizard flow already implements this ladder well. The key implementation detail: never ask for more commitment than the current perceived value justifies. Photos before questions (photos feel productive). Questions before auth (questions feel informative). Auth before generation (generation is the expensive AI call).
- **Measure:** Step-over-step conversion rate. Each step should maintain >70% progression to the next.

## Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Do

These patterns would undermine trust with anxious homeowners making expensive decisions.

### AP-1: Artificial Urgency

- **Don't:** "Only 5 scopes left today!" or "Prices increase at midnight!"
- **Why not:** ScopeAI serves homeowners making $15K-$150K decisions. Fake urgency insults them and erodes the trust that is ScopeAI's core value. They will see through it and leave.
- **Do instead:** Real urgency only: "Renovation season starts in September -- start planning now so your tradies aren't booked out."

### AP-2: Dark Paywall Patterns

- **Don't:** Blur scope content to tease. Show a timer counting down to "price increase." Show fake "other users are viewing this" notifications.
- **Why not:** The PRD explicitly states "no blur tease." The paywall is clean: summary shown, full content locked. Respect the user's intelligence.
- **Do instead:** Let quality speak for itself. The 1-2 sample items per trade demonstrate scope quality. The item count creates natural curiosity.

### AP-3: Over-Notification

- **Don't:** Email every day. Send push notifications about scope updates. SMS reminders.
- **Why not:** This is a low-frequency product. Users buy 1-5 times. Every unnecessary notification degrades the brand.
- **Do instead:** Maximum 3 emails post-abandoned-wizard (24h, 72h, 7d). Maximum 2 emails post-purchase (7d check-in, seasonal prompt). Users can unsubscribe from all.

### AP-4: Exploiting Anxiety

- **Don't:** "Without a scope, your renovation WILL go over budget!" or "Don't let tradies rip you off -- buy now!"
- **Why not:** The user is already anxious. Amplifying fear to drive conversion is manipulative and contradicts ScopeAI's mission to build confidence.
- **Do instead:** Acknowledge anxiety and provide the solution: "Renovation budgets blow out when tradies quote different things. A detailed scope fixes that."

### AP-5: Gamification of Serious Decisions

- **Don't:** Achievement badges ("Scope Master!"), streak counters, leaderboards, confetti on purchase.
- **Why not:** This is a professional tool for a high-stakes financial decision. Gamification trivialises it and signals "toy" not "tool."
- **Do instead:** Subtle positive reinforcement: progress bar completion, "Scope is ready!" (not "Congratulations!!!!"), checkmark animations on generation.
