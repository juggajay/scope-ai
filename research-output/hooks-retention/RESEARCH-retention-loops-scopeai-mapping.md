# Retention Loops -- ScopeAI Mapping

**Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Map every relevant retention loop to ScopeAI's specific mechanics, data model, and user journey. Each loop includes mechanics, metrics, implementation notes, and failure modes.

---

## How to Read This Document

ScopeAI is a **one-time-purchase, low-frequency, high-stakes product**. Traditional SaaS retention thinking (DAU/MAU, session frequency) does not apply. Our "retention" means:

1. **Funnel retention** -- user starts wizard, finishes wizard, pays
2. **Multi-room retention** -- user returns for a second scope (kitchen done, bathroom next)
3. **Referral retention** -- user sends new users who also convert
4. **Lifecycle retention** -- user references their scope during the actual renovation (weeks/months)

Every loop below is evaluated through this lens.

---

## 1. Acquisition Loops

### 1.1 SEO Content Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
Homeowner searches "kitchen renovation scope template australia"
  --> Finds ScopeAI guide/landing page (organic)
  --> Starts wizard (converts to lead)
  --> Pays for scope
  --> Scope PDF has "Generated by ScopeAI -- scopeai.com.au" footer
  --> Scope references AU Standards (builds authority signal)
  --> Google sees engagement metrics (low bounce, long session)
  --> Rankings improve
  --> More searches find ScopeAI
  --> Loop compounds
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Organic sessions/month | 500 by month 3 | PostHog + Google Search Console |
| Organic-to-wizard start rate | 15%+ | PostHog |
| Average position for target keywords | Top 10 | Search Console |
| Pages indexed | 20+ guides by month 6 | Search Console |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Where:** `/guides/` route group -- static MDX pages, server-rendered
- **What to build:** 5 initial guides matching project types: "Kitchen Renovation Scope of Works Template Australia", "Bathroom Renovation Checklist", "How to Compare Builder Quotes", "What Trades Do I Need for a Kitchen Renovation", "Renovation Sequencing Guide"
- **Data model connection:** Guides reference actual `TradeType` values and question IDs from `lib/questions/`, so content stays consistent with the product
- **CTA placement:** Each guide ends with "Generate your personalised scope in under 10 minutes" linking to `/create`
- **PDF branding:** `lib/pdf/styles.ts` footer already has "Generated by ScopeAI" -- add `scopeai.com.au` URL

**What Could Break It:**
- Thin content that Google ignores (need 1500+ words per guide with genuine value)
- Guides that feel like sales pages instead of helpful resources
- Slow page load killing Core Web Vitals (server-render guides, no heavy client JS)
- Not updating content when AU Standards change

**Capital Efficiency Rating:** HIGH. SEO is the cheapest acquisition channel for bootstrapped products. Content is written once, compounds forever. No ad spend.

### 1.2 Tradie Referral Loop (B2B2C)

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
Homeowner pays for scope
  --> Downloads PDF, emails to 3 tradies
  --> Tradie reads professional scope with ScopeAI branding
  --> Tradie thinks: "This is useful. I can quote this accurately."
  --> Tradie's next client asks "how do I brief you?"
  --> Tradie says "use ScopeAI" or "get a proper scope first"
  --> New homeowner visits ScopeAI
  --> Loop repeats
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| PDF downloads per paid user | 3+ (one per tradie) | PostHog: `scope_pdf_downloaded` |
| Tradie referral attribution | Track via UTM or referral code | PostHog |
| New users from tradie referral | 10% of new users by month 6 | PostHog |
| Scope emails sent per user | 2+ | PostHog: `scope_emailed_to_tradie` |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **PDF footer:** In `lib/pdf/styles.ts`, add: "This scope was generated by ScopeAI. Get your own at scopeai.com.au/tradie-referral"
- **Tradie referral landing page:** `/tradie-referral` -- "A tradie recommended ScopeAI? Here's why." Speaks tradie language. Different from homeowner landing page.
- **Tracking:** Add `?ref=tradie` UTM to all PDF links. Track `scope_pdf_downloaded` event with property `tradeType` to understand which trades drive referrals.
- **Email template:** When user emails scope via `convex/email.ts` (Resend action), include a brief "What is ScopeAI?" section for the tradie recipient with link back to site.
- **Shareable links (V2):** `DL-04` from PRD -- when tradie opens shared link, show subtle "Create scopes for your clients" CTA.

**What Could Break It:**
- Scope quality too low -- tradies dismiss it as "AI garbage"
- PDF has no branding or branding is too subtle
- Tradies can't actually price from the scope (specifications too vague)
- No easy way for tradies to refer (need a simple link or QR code)

**Capital Efficiency Rating:** HIGH. Zero acquisition cost. The PDF IS the marketing material. Every scope downloaded and emailed is an impression.

---

### 1.3 Word-of-Mouth Loop (Homeowner-to-Homeowner)

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
Homeowner generates scope for kitchen
  --> Renovation goes well (quotes are comparable, no budget blowout)
  --> Neighbour/friend/colleague asks "how did your reno go?"
  --> User says "I used this thing called ScopeAI to get my scope sorted"
  --> Friend searches "ScopeAI" or follows shared link
  --> Friend starts their own scope
  --> Loop repeats
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| NPS score | 70+ | In-app survey (PostHog) |
| "How did you hear about us?" = friend/referral | 20%+ of new users | PostHog: `signup_source` |
| Referral link shares | Track generation + clicks | PostHog |
| Branded search volume | Growing month-over-month | Search Console |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **NPS survey:** Trigger in-app 7 days after payment. PostHog feature flag to control timing. Event: `nps_survey_shown`, `nps_score_submitted`.
- **Share mechanism:** Post-payment, show "Know someone renovating? Share ScopeAI" with pre-filled SMS/email/copy-link. Event: `referral_link_shared` with property `channel` (sms/email/copy).
- **Referral program (V2):** `referral-revenue` loop below. But day-1: just make sharing easy.
- **The real driver:** Scope quality. If the scope helps them save money and avoid blowouts, they WILL tell people. No amount of "share this" buttons compensates for a mediocre product.

**What Could Break It:**
- Scope quality doesn't meet expectations (most critical risk)
- Renovation still goes over budget (user blames ScopeAI even if scope was correct)
- No easy sharing mechanism at the right moment
- User forgets ScopeAI by the time someone asks (renovation takes months)

**Capital Efficiency Rating:** HIGHEST. Zero cost, highest trust signal. But takes time to compound (renovation cycle = months).

---

### 1.4 Social Proof Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
More users generate scopes
  --> Counter increases ("Join 2,847 Australian homeowners")
  --> Landing page shows credibility
  --> Higher conversion rate on new visitors
  --> More scopes generated
  --> Counter grows faster
  --> Loop accelerates
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Total scopes generated (all-time) | Display on landing page | Convex query |
| Landing page conversion rate | 3%+ (visitor to wizard start) | PostHog |
| Conversion lift from social proof | A/B test: with vs without counter | PostHog feature flag |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Where:** Landing page hero section, LP-05 from PRD ("Trust signals")
- **Data source:** Convex query counting `projects` where `status === "paid"`. Cache this -- don't query on every page load. Update hourly via scheduled function.
- **Display:** "X,XXX renovation scopes generated" -- round to nearest 50 at small scale, nearest 100 at larger scale. Never show exact small numbers.
- **Cold start:** See `RESEARCH-retention-loops-cold-start.md` for bootstrapping strategy.
- **Secondary proof:** "Based on Australian Standards AS/NZS 3000, AS 3740, etc." -- standards references are trust signals even at zero users.

**What Could Break It:**
- Showing "3 scopes generated" is worse than showing nothing (cold start problem)
- Counter grows too slowly to feel meaningful
- Users don't trust the number (feels inflated)

**Capital Efficiency Rating:** MEDIUM. Free to implement. But depends on other loops generating volume first.

---

## 2. Engagement Loops (Funnel Completion)

These loops operate within a single session. Goal: convert wizard-starters into paying customers.

### 2.1 Progress + Sunk Cost Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User starts wizard (endowed progress: 5%)
  --> Selects mode (+10% = 15%)
  --> Selects project type, enters property details (+15% = 30%)
  --> Uploads 3+ photos (+15% = 45%)
  --> Answers questions (+30% across all Qs = ~75% by end)
  --> Sunk cost: "I've already invested 8 minutes and uploaded my photos"
  --> Auth gate feels like a minor step, not a wall
  --> Generation: watching real trades appear builds excitement
  --> Preview at 95%: "I'm so close, just need to unlock"
  --> Payment feels like the final small step, not a big commitment
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Step-to-step drop-off rate | <15% per step | PostHog funnel |
| Photo upload to questions completion | 80%+ | PostHog |
| Questions to auth gate | 75%+ | PostHog |
| Auth gate to generation | 90%+ | PostHog |
| Preview to payment | 40%+ | PostHog |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Already built:** `lib/wizard/progress.ts` has `PROGRESS_WEIGHTS` with front-loaded weights. `WizardProgress.tsx` renders the bar with spring animation.
- **Key insight from wizard spec:** Progress is front-loaded -- user hits 50% by mid-questions. This is by design (endowed progress + goal gradient).
- **Enhancement opportunity:** After photo upload, show a micro-celebration. "Great photos! We can see your existing layout clearly." Validates their input, reinforces progress.
- **PostHog events to fire:**
  - `wizard_step_completed` with property `step` (0-6), `stepName`, `durationSeconds`
  - `wizard_step_abandoned` with property `step`, `stepName`, `timeOnStep`
  - `wizard_resumed` with property `fromStep`, `daysSinceLastVisit`

**What Could Break It:**
- Progress bar feels dishonest (user senses manipulation)
- Steps take too long (photo upload on slow connection)
- Questions feel irrelevant or repetitive
- Auth gate feels like a bait-and-switch ("I thought this was free")

---

### 2.2 Curiosity Gap Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User uploads photos
  --> Photo analysis runs in background (photoAnalysisStatus: "running")
  --> User answers questions (doesn't notice analysis running)
  --> Generation begins -- per-trade cards appear one by one
  --> Each card reveals: trade name + item count ("Electrical: 11 items")
  --> User thinks: "I need an electrician? What are the 11 items?"
  --> Preview shows 1 sample item per trade: "New dedicated circuit for wall oven -- 32A circuit, 6mm cable..."
  --> User thinks: "This is specific to MY kitchen. What are the other 10 items?"
  --> Curiosity drives payment
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Time spent on preview page | 60-120 seconds (reading samples) | PostHog |
| Sample item expansion rate | Track clicks on sample items | PostHog |
| Preview-to-payment conversion | 40%+ | PostHog |
| Tier selection distribution | Track Starter/Professional/Premium split | PostHog |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Already built:** `ScopePreview.tsx` shows trade names + item counts + 1 sample item. `PaywallGate.tsx` shows pricing tiers.
- **The preview is the variable reward mechanism.** The user sees ENOUGH to know the scope is real, personalised, and professional. But not enough to get the value without paying.
- **Enhancement:** Show the total item count prominently. "Your kitchen renovation requires 53 scope items across 7 trades." The number itself creates curiosity.
- **The sample item matters enormously.** It must be specific (references their property details), technical (uses correct AU terminology), and surprising (something they didn't think of). This is where `ScopePreviewTrade.sampleItems` gets scrutinised.
- **PostHog events:**
  - `preview_viewed` with properties: `tradeCount`, `totalItemCount`, `projectType`
  - `preview_sample_expanded` with property `tradeType`
  - `pricing_tier_selected` with property `tier`, `price`

**What Could Break It:**
- Sample items are generic/obvious (user thinks "I could have written that")
- Too many sample items shown (gives away too much value)
- Preview loads slowly after generation (momentum dies)
- Item counts are too low (scope feels thin)

---

### 2.3 Personalisation Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User enters property details (suburb: Paddington, state: NSW, year: 1985)
  --> System flags: pre-1990 property, asbestos inspection recommended
  --> User uploads kitchen photos
  --> AI detects: gas cooktop, laminate benchtops, limited GPOs
  --> User answers: switching to induction, stone benchtops, island bench with sink
  --> Each input makes the scope MORE specific to their situation
  --> Preview shows: "Kitchen Renovation -- Paddington, NSW" (their data reflected back)
  --> Trade scopes reference: "Property age 1985 -- switchboard likely requires RCD upgrade"
  --> User thinks: "This isn't a template. This was built for MY kitchen."
  --> Perceived value increases with each personal detail
  --> Higher willingness to pay
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Questions answered (vs skipped) | 85%+ answered | PostHog |
| Photos uploaded (beyond minimum) | Average 5+ (min is 3) | PostHog |
| Description field filled | 40%+ of users | PostHog |
| "Not sure" answer rate | <20% of total answers | PostHog |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Already built:** Photo analysis extracts existing fixtures/materials. Questions capture desired outcome. Both feed into scope generation prompts via `master-system.md` context injection.
- **Key personalisation signals visible in preview:**
  - Property location in header ("Paddington, NSW")
  - Asbestos warning for pre-1990 properties (from `ASBESTOS_YEAR_THRESHOLD`)
  - Trade count specific to their answers (wall removal = structural trade added)
  - Sample items reference their specific choices ("induction cooktop" not "cooktop")
- **Enhancement:** In the preview, show a "Based on your inputs" summary: "Because you're switching from gas to induction, we've included a dedicated 32A circuit and gas disconnection." This explicitly connects their input to the output.
- **PostHog events:**
  - `question_answered` with properties: `questionId`, `answer`, `isNotSure`, `isMultiSelect`
  - `photo_uploaded` with property `photoNumber` (1st, 2nd, etc.), `projectType`
  - `description_entered` with property `characterCount`

**What Could Break It:**
- Scope feels generic despite personalisation (AI prompt quality issue)
- Property details not reflected in preview (wasted input = eroded trust)
- Too many "Not sure" answers = less personalised scope
- Photo analysis fails silently and scope isn't as specific as it could be

## 3. Retention Loops (Return Visits)

### 3.1 Multi-Room Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User pays for kitchen scope ($99 Professional)
  --> Downloads PDFs, emails to tradies
  --> Renovation begins
  --> User thinks: "I should do the bathroom while the plumber is here"
  --> Returns to ScopeAI account dashboard
  --> Sees: "Start another room" with pre-filled property details
  --> Selects "Bathroom"
  --> Property details (suburb, state, type, year) already filled
  --> Uploads bathroom photos, answers bathroom questions
  --> Generation is faster (property context reused)
  --> Pays again ($99 or upgrades to $149)
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Users with 2+ projects | 10%+ of paid users | Convex query on `projects` by `userId` |
| Time between 1st and 2nd purchase | Median < 30 days | PostHog cohort analysis |
| Pre-fill adoption rate | 80%+ use pre-filled details | PostHog |
| Second room project type distribution | Track which room follows which | PostHog |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Where:** Account dashboard (`app/account/page.tsx`) + post-payment CTA in scope view
- **Pre-fill mechanism:** When user starts a new project, check for existing projects with same `userId`. If found, pre-fill `propertySuburb`, `propertyState`, `propertyType`, `propertyAge` from most recent project. This saves Step 1 effort significantly.
- **Data model:** Already supports this -- `projects` table has `userId` index. Query `getProjectsByUser` returns all projects.
- **Post-payment prompt:** In scope view header or after first PDF download, show subtle card: "Planning to renovate another room? Your property details are saved -- start in 2 minutes." Link to `/create` with pre-fill flag.
- **Email trigger:** 14 days after purchase, send "How's the renovation going?" email. Include: "When you're ready for the next room, your details are saved." Link to dashboard.
- **Pricing psychology:** Consider a multi-room discount. "Add a second room for $79" (vs $99 full price). This is a V2 feature but should be designed into the schema now. Add optional `discountCode` field to `projects` table.
- **PostHog events:**
  - `second_room_started` with properties: `firstProjectType`, `secondProjectType`, `daysSinceFirstPurchase`
  - `property_prefilled` with property `fieldsReused` (count)
  - `multi_room_prompt_shown`, `multi_room_prompt_clicked`

**What Could Break It:**
- User doesn't think of ScopeAI when planning second room (out of sight, out of mind)
- Pre-fill doesn't work or resets (friction returns)
- Second scope quality is lower (different trade mix, different prompts)
- Price feels too high for "the same thing again" (discount expectation)

---

### 3.2 Renovation Lifecycle Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User generates scope (Week 0)
  --> Downloads PDFs, sends to tradies (Week 0-1)
  --> Gets quotes back, compares using scope as framework (Week 2-4)
  --> Selects tradies, renovation begins (Week 4-8)
  --> During renovation, user references scope on phone:
      "Did we include under-cabinet lighting?" --> opens ScopeAI, checks
  --> User toggles items during construction as plans change
  --> Scope becomes the living project checklist
  --> User returns to ScopeAI 5-10 times over renovation lifecycle
  --> Each return reinforces brand, increases likelihood of referral + second room
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Return visits to scope view (post-payment) | 3+ per paid user | PostHog |
| Item toggles per user | 5+ toggles over lifecycle | PostHog: `scope_item_toggled` |
| Scope view sessions > 7 days after purchase | 50%+ of paid users | PostHog cohort |
| Mobile vs desktop for return visits | Track device type | PostHog |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Already built:** Full scope view at `/scope/[projectId]` with item toggles that persist. Optimistic updates via Convex reactive queries. PDF regenerates from current toggle state.
- **Mobile is critical here.** User is on a building site checking their scope. The scope view MUST be readable on mobile without zooming. Touch targets for toggles must be 44px+ (already specified in wizard spec).
- **Enhancement -- "During Construction" mode:** Add a simplified view that shows scope items as a checklist. User can mark items as "completed" or "in progress". This gives them a reason to return repeatedly. Data model: add `completionStatus?: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"` to `ScopeItem` type.
- **Enhancement -- Notes per item:** Allow user to add notes to any scope item ("Tradie said he'll do this Thursday"). Turns scope from static document into living project tracker.
- **Email cadence:** Week 1: "Your scope is ready." Week 2: "Getting quotes? Here are tips for comparing them." Week 4: "Renovation starting? Here's your checklist." Week 8: "How's it going? Update your scope as things change."
- **PostHog events:**
  - `scope_viewed` with properties: `daysSincePurchase`, `device`, `projectId`
  - `scope_item_toggled` with properties: `tradeType`, `itemId`, `included`, `daysSincePurchase`
  - `scope_pdf_redownloaded` with property `daysSincePurchase`

**What Could Break It:**
- User downloads PDF and never returns to the web app (PDF is the product, not the app)
- Scope view is hard to use on mobile at a building site
- No reason to come back -- static scope doesn't change
- Tradie ignores the scope entirely (user feels it was wasted money)

---

### 3.3 Update/Re-engagement Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User generated scope 3 months ago
  --> Australian Standards update (e.g., new AS/NZS 3000 revision)
  --> ScopeAI sends email: "New electrical standards may affect your kitchen scope"
  --> User clicks through, sees what changed
  --> User re-engages with ScopeAI brand
  --> If renovation hasn't started: may regenerate scope ($49 for update)
  --> If renovation is done: remembers ScopeAI for next project
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Re-engagement email open rate | 30%+ | Resend analytics |
| Click-through from update email | 10%+ | PostHog |
| Scope update purchases | Track as separate revenue event | Stripe |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Where:** Email via `convex/email.ts` (Resend action) + PostHog for segmentation
- **Trigger types:**
  - Standards updates (quarterly check, manual trigger): "New AS/NZS 3000 revision affects your electrical scope"
  - Seasonal: "Spring renovation season -- time to start your bathroom?" (September-October in AU)
  - Price changes: "Material costs have changed since your scope" (requires market data, V2)
  - Anniversary: "Your kitchen scope is 6 months old. Need an update?" (if not yet renovated)
- **Email frequency:** Maximum 1 per month. Homeowners will unsubscribe immediately if over-emailed. Each email must provide genuine value, not just re-engagement for its own sake.
- **Segmentation:** PostHog cohorts based on: `daysSincePurchase`, `projectType`, `hasMultipleProjects`, `state` (for state-specific standards).
- **V2 feature:** "Scope Refresh" -- regenerate scope with updated standards/prices for 50% of original price. Requires versioning in the data model.

**What Could Break It:**
- Emails feel spammy or irrelevant
- Standards haven't actually changed (false urgency erodes trust)
- User already completed renovation (update is useless)
- Too frequent = unsubscribe; too infrequent = forgotten

---

## 4. Monetisation Loops

### 4.1 Tier Upsell Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User buys Starter ($49) for kitchen
  --> Sees value: professional scope, comparable quotes
  --> Renovation goes well
  --> Starts bathroom scope
  --> At pricing tier selection, remembers: "Professional had coordination checklist, more trades, revisions"
  --> Selects Professional ($99) this time
  --> Even better experience (more detailed, coordination checklist helps)
  --> If third room: considers Premium ($149)
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Starter-to-Professional upgrade rate | 30%+ on second purchase | PostHog + Stripe |
| Average tier per purchase number | Tier increases with purchase count | PostHog |
| Revenue per user (lifetime) | $120+ average | Stripe |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Where:** `ScopePreview.tsx` and `PaywallGate.tsx` pricing tier selection
- **Already built:** `PRICING_TIERS` in `lib/constants.ts` with `recommended: true` on Professional
- **Enhancement:** For returning users (2nd+ project), show their previous tier with a subtle note: "You previously chose Starter. Upgrade to Professional for coordination checklist and detailed PC sums." This is social proof + anchoring.
- **Data model:** Query `getProjectsByUser` to check for previous purchases and their tiers. Display in pricing UI.
- **PostHog events:**
  - `pricing_tier_viewed` with properties: `previousTier` (if returning user), `projectNumber`
  - `pricing_tier_selected` with properties: `tier`, `isUpgradeFromPrevious`, `projectNumber`

**What Could Break It:**
- Starter scope is too good -- no reason to upgrade
- Starter scope is too limited -- user feels cheated and doesn't come back
- Tier differences not clear enough at selection time
- Professional/Premium don't deliver noticeably more value

---

### 4.2 Referral-Revenue Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
User A generates scope, has great experience
  --> User A shares referral link with friend (User B)
  --> User B signs up, generates scope, pays
  --> User A receives credit ($20 toward next room)
  --> User A is now MORE likely to buy a second room (reduced price)
  --> User A starts second room with $20 discount
  --> Both User A and User B now have referral links
  --> Loop compounds
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Referral links generated | 20%+ of paid users | PostHog |
| Referral link conversion rate | 15%+ (link click to payment) | PostHog |
| Credit redemption rate | 60%+ of earned credits | Convex + Stripe |
| Referral-driven revenue share | 10%+ of total revenue by month 6 | Stripe |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **V2 feature** -- not MVP. But design data model now.
- **Schema addition (future):** Add to `profiles` table: `referralCode: v.optional(v.string())`, `referredBy: v.optional(v.string())`, `referralCredits: v.optional(v.number())`. Add to `projects` table: `discountAmountCents: v.optional(v.number())`, `referralCodeUsed: v.optional(v.string())`.
- **Mechanics:** Generate unique referral code on first purchase. Show on scope view + account dashboard. When referee pays, credit $20 to referrer's account. Credit applied automatically at next checkout.
- **Anti-gaming:** One credit per referred user (not per purchase). Credits expire after 12 months. Cannot self-refer (same email domain check).
- **PostHog events:**
  - `referral_link_generated`
  - `referral_link_shared` with property `channel`
  - `referral_credit_earned` with property `amount`
  - `referral_credit_redeemed` with property `amount`, `projectId`

**What Could Break It:**
- Credit amount too low to motivate sharing ($10 too low, $50 too high)
- Referral flow is complicated (need to explain, remember code, etc.)
- User doesn't buy a second room, so credit is wasted
- Gaming/fraud (self-referral, fake accounts)

---

### 4.3 Content-Commerce Loop

**Loop Mechanics:**

```
ScopeAI publishes guide: "Kitchen Renovation Scope Checklist Australia"
  --> Ranks on Google (SEO content loop)
  --> User reads guide, learns about scope planning
  --> Guide includes: "Want a personalised scope? ScopeAI generates one from your photos."
  --> User clicks CTA, enters wizard, pays
  --> Revenue from conversion funds more content production
  --> More guides published --> more keywords ranked --> more traffic
  --> Loop compounds with every new piece of content
```

**Key Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Content-attributed revenue | Track via UTM | PostHog + Stripe |
| Content ROI | Revenue from content visitors / cost to produce | Spreadsheet |
| Guides published per month | 2-4 | Manual |
| Average revenue per content visitor | $2+ (at 3% conversion * $70 avg) | Calculated |

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Where:** `/guides/` route group, linked from landing page and SEO
- **Content strategy:** Each of the 5 project types gets 3-4 guides. Plus general renovation guides. 15-20 total pieces.
- **Measurement:** Every guide CTA links to `/create?utm_source=guide&utm_content={guide-slug}`. PostHog tracks `wizard_started` with `source` property.
- **Cost:** Content is cheap to produce (AI-assisted writing, reviewed by human). Maybe $50-100 per guide if outsourced.

**What Could Break It:**
- Content doesn't rank (wrong keywords, weak domain authority)
- Content ranks but doesn't convert (guide is too helpful -- user doesn't need the tool)
- Content production stops (founder gets busy, no pipeline)
- Guide content contradicts scope output (confusing/trust-eroding)

## 5. Loop Prioritisation for ScopeAI

### Tier 1: Build for MVP (Before Launch)

| Loop | Why First | Implementation Effort |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Progress + Sunk Cost** | Already built into wizard. Just needs PostHog events. | LOW (events only) |
| **Curiosity Gap** | Already built into preview. Tune sample item quality. | LOW (prompt tuning) |
| **Personalisation** | Already built into AI pipeline. Ensure preview reflects personal details. | LOW (verify existing) |
| **SEO Content** | 5 initial guides. Cheapest acquisition channel. | MEDIUM (content creation) |

### Tier 2: Build in First Month Post-Launch

| Loop | Why Second | Implementation Effort |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Multi-Room** | Requires real users to test. Pre-fill mechanism is simple. | MEDIUM |
| **Social Proof** | Need real numbers first. Counter is simple to build. | LOW |
| **Tradie Referral** | PDF branding already exists. Add referral landing page. | MEDIUM |
| **Renovation Lifecycle** | Need email cadence. Requires Resend (Phase 9 complete). | MEDIUM |

### Tier 3: Build When Validated (Month 2-3)

| Loop | Why Later | Implementation Effort |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Word-of-Mouth** | Organic. Enable with NPS survey + share mechanism. | LOW |
| **Tier Upsell** | Need multi-room data to design properly. | LOW |
| **Update/Re-engagement** | Need content to email about. Standards don't change often. | MEDIUM |
| **Content-Commerce** | Need initial content. Expands SEO loop. | MEDIUM |

### Tier 4: Build When Growing (Month 3+)

| Loop | Why Last | Implementation Effort |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Referral-Revenue** | Need transaction volume. Complex to implement correctly. | HIGH |

## 6. Loop Interaction Map

Loops don't operate in isolation. Here's how they feed each other:

The system works when:
1. SEO brings in traffic (top of funnel)
2. Engagement loops convert traffic to payment (middle)
3. Quality scope drives word-of-mouth + tradie referrals (bottom feeds back to top)
4. Multi-room + lifecycle loops extract more value per user (expands middle)

The single most important variable across ALL loops: **scope quality**. If the scope is genuinely useful, every loop strengthens. If it's mediocre, every loop decays.
