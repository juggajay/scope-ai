# Waterproofing in Australian Residential Renovations
## Section 3: Sequencing & Coordination

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference document for ScopeAI's AI scope-of-works generator. Covers the full sequencing and coordination requirements for waterproofing work within Australian residential renovations (bathrooms, laundries, and other wet areas). This is arguably the most sequencing-critical trade in any wet-area renovation -- getting the order wrong is expensive and time-consuming to fix.
**Confidence Level:** HIGH unless otherwise noted. Based on AS 3740:2021 (Waterproofing of domestic wet areas), NCC 2022/2025 Housing Provisions Part 10.2, AS/NZS 4858:2004 (wet area membranes), state-specific licensing and inspection requirements, and cross-referenced against multiple Australian waterproofing specialists, trade publications, and building authority guidance.

## 1. Why Waterproofing Sequencing Is Critical

**Confidence: HIGH**

Waterproofing is the single most sequencing-sensitive trade in any wet-area renovation. Unlike most trades, where a mistake can be patched or adjusted, a compromised waterproof membrane has cascading consequences:

1. **It cannot be inspected once covered.** Once tiles go over the membrane, the waterproofing is permanently hidden. If it was done wrong, the only remedy is full demolition of the tiled surface and re-application -- a cost of $5,000-$15,000+ depending on the bathroom.

2. **It sits at the bottleneck of the timeline.** Every trade before waterproofing (demolition, plumbing rough-in, electrical rough-in, carpentry, screeding) must be 100% complete. Every trade after waterproofing (tiling, cabinetry, final plumbing fix, final electrical fix, painting) cannot start until the membrane is inspected, certified, and cured. Waterproofing is literally the fulcrum of the renovation timeline.

3. **It is a mandatory hold point.** In most Australian states, tiling cannot legally commence until the waterproofing has been inspected and a compliance certificate has been issued. Skipping this step invalidates insurance, creates compliance issues at sale, and exposes the homeowner to structural damage from undetected leaks.

4. **Membrane penetration after application is catastrophic.** If a plumber or electrician needs to drill, cut, or modify anything in the floor or walls after waterproofing, the membrane is compromised. It must be repaired or entirely re-done, adding cost and 2-5 days to the timeline.

**Scope-of-works implication:** The waterproofing scope must explicitly state the pre-conditions (what must be complete before the waterproofer arrives) and the hold point (no tiling until certificate issued). This protects the homeowner from trades working out of sequence.

## 2. The Complete Renovation Sequence

**Confidence: HIGH**

The following is the exact sequence for a bathroom renovation, showing where waterproofing sits relative to every other trade. This sequence applies to full renovations (strip-out and rebuild). Partial renovations may skip early steps but the waterproofing-onwards sequence is always the same.

### Step-by-Step Sequence

```
PHASE 1: DEMOLITION
  Step 1.  Disconnect services (plumber + electrician)
  Step 2.  Strip-out: remove tiles, fixtures, fittings, old membrane
  Step 3.  Asbestos inspection/removal if pre-1990 home (licensed assessor)
  Step 4.  Rubbish removal and site clean-up

PHASE 2: ROUGH-IN (FIRST FIX)
  Step 5.  Plumbing rough-in:
           - All waste pipes positioned (floor waste, shower waste, toilet, basin)
           - All water supply pipes run (hot, cold, shower mixer, basin taps, toilet cistern)
           - Puddle flange / floor waste body installed at correct height
           - Shower mixer valve body installed in wall at correct position
           - Bath waste positioned (if applicable)
  Step 6.  Electrical rough-in (can run parallel with plumber):
           - Wiring for lights, exhaust fan, GPOs, heated towel rail
           - In-floor heating cable/mat laid if applicable (see Section 8)
           - Exhaust fan ducting run to external vent
           - All cables chased into walls and floor as needed
  Step 7.  Rough-in inspection (plumbing and electrical sign-off where required)

PHASE 3: SUBSTRATE PREPARATION
  Step 8.  Shower hob / base construction:
           - Builder/carpenter constructs shower hob (mortar, Hebel, or prefab polyurethane hob)
           - Shower niche framed into wall stud (if applicable)
           - Hob must be structurally fixed to floor and sealed to walls
  Step 9.  Plastering / wall close-up:
           - Plasterboard (water-resistant grade for wet areas) installed on walls
           - Any ceiling work completed
           - All wall surfaces smooth, flush, and ready for membrane
  Step 10. Screed to falls:
           - Sand/cement screed applied to shower floor (minimum 1:80 fall to floor waste)
           - General bathroom floor levelled if uneven
           - Screed must fully cure before waterproofing (typically 24-48 hours minimum)

PHASE 4: WATERPROOFING (THIS SCOPE)                      <<< CRITICAL PHASE
  Step 11. Surface preparation:
           - Clean substrate: free from dust, debris, oils, loose material
           - Corners, junctions, and transitions prepared
           - Bond breakers / corner fillets installed at wall-floor, wall-wall, hob-wall junctions
  Step 12. Primer applied:
           - Appropriate primer for the substrate type and membrane system
  Step 13. First coat of membrane applied:
           - Liquid-applied membrane or sheet membrane system
           - Reinforcing tape / bandage embedded into wet membrane at all junctions
           - Floor waste / puddle flange sealed into membrane system
  Step 14. Drying time between coats:
           - Minimum as per manufacturer's instructions (typically 2-6 hours depending on product)
  Step 15. Second coat of membrane applied:
           - Applied perpendicular to first coat for coverage assurance
           - Minimum dry film thickness achieved (typically 1.0-1.5mm total)
  Step 16. Full cure time:
           - 24-72 hours depending on product, temperature, humidity, ventilation

PHASE 5: HOLD POINT -- INSPECTION & CERTIFICATION        <<< MANDATORY STOP
  Step 17. Visual inspection of membrane:
           - Check for pinholes, tears, thin spots, inadequate coverage
           - Verify wall heights (1800mm or 50mm above shower rose, whichever higher)
           - Verify all junctions properly sealed with tape/bandage
           - Verify floor waste / puddle flange integration
           - Verify bond breakers at all required junctions
  Step 18. Flood test (if required by specification or certifier):
           - Area flooded with potable water to 25-100mm depth at low point
           - Held for minimum 24 hours
           - Check for any water loss or leakage to areas below
  Step 19. Waterproofing compliance certificate issued:
           - Issued by the licensed waterproofing contractor
           - Documents products used, areas covered, membrane type, and compliance with AS 3740:2021
           - This certificate must be retained by the homeowner permanently

PHASE 6: POST-WATERPROOFING TRADES
  Step 20. In-floor heating mat installed ON TOP of membrane (if applicable -- see Section 8)
  Step 21. Tiling commences:
           - Floor tiles laid first, then wall tiles
           - Tiler must not damage membrane during installation
  Step 22. Grouting
  Step 23. Vanity / cabinetry installation
  Step 24. Plumber final fix (taps, toilet, shower head, basin waste, towel rail)
  Step 25. Electrician final fix (downlights, exhaust fan, heated towel rail connection, GPO covers)
  Step 26. Silicone sealing (shower screen, vanity to wall, bath to wall)
  Step 27. Shower screen installation
  Step 28. Accessories (mirror, towel rails, toilet roll holder)
  Step 29. Painting (ceiling and any walls above tile line)
  Step 30. Final clean and handover
```

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope document should reference this sequence explicitly, noting that the waterproofer requires Steps 1-10 to be fully complete before arriving on site. The scope should also note that the waterproofing certificate is a mandatory prerequisite for Step 21 (tiling).

## 3. Pre-Waterproofing Requirements Checklist

**Confidence: HIGH**

The following items must be 100% complete before the waterproofer can commence work. If any item is incomplete, the waterproofer should refuse to proceed -- starting with an incomplete substrate leads to membrane failure.

### 3.1 Plumbing Rough-In -- Must Be Complete

| Item | Detail | Why It Must Be Done First |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| **All waste pipes** | Floor waste, shower waste, toilet waste, basin waste -- all at final position and height | Pipes are embedded in or under the floor. Moving them later means cutting through the membrane. |
| **All water supply pipes** | Hot and cold to every fixture, capped and pressure tested | Supply pipes run through walls that will be waterproofed. Modifications require membrane repair. |
| **Shower mixer rough-in** | Mixer body installed in wall at correct height and position | The wall around the mixer body is waterproofed. Repositioning destroys the membrane. |
| **Puddle flange / floor waste** | Installed at the correct height relative to screed | The membrane terminates and seals into the puddle flange. This is a critical junction. |
| **Plumbing inspection** | State-required rough-in inspection completed and passed | Some states require plumbing rough-in to be inspected before being concealed. |

### 3.2 Electrical Rough-In -- Must Be Complete

| Item | Detail | Why It Must Be Done First |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| **All wiring chased into walls/floors** | Light switches, GPOs, exhaust fan, heated towel rail points | Any wiring in the walls or floor is concealed by the membrane. Modifications require cutting through it. |
| **In-floor heating cable** | If in-screed system: cable embedded in screed below membrane. If mat system: see Section 8 for alternate sequencing. | In-screed heating cables must be installed BEFORE waterproofing. Mat-type systems go AFTER waterproofing. |
| **Exhaust fan ducting** | Duct run from fan location to external wall/roof | Ducting may pass through the ceiling void above waterproofed walls. Must be positioned before wall close-up. |

### 3.3 Structural / Carpentry -- Must Be Complete

| Item | Detail | Why It Must Be Done First |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Shower hob** | Constructed from mortar, Hebel block, or prefabricated polyurethane hob. Must be structurally fixed to floor and sealed against walls. | The membrane wraps continuously over the hob. Hob cannot be modified after waterproofing. |
| **Shower niche** | Framed into wall stud, lined with water-resistant board. | The niche interior is fully waterproofed. Modifications require membrane re-application. |
| **Wall framing and lining** | All plasterboard installed (must be water-resistant grade in wet areas). Surfaces smooth and flush. No protruding screws, gaps, or rough patches. | The membrane is applied directly to wall surfaces. Uneven substrate causes thin spots and adhesion failure. |

### 3.4 Screed -- Must Be Complete and Cured

| Item | Detail | Why It Must Be Done First |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Shower floor screed** | Sand/cement screed laid with correct fall to floor waste (minimum 1:80 to 1:100 gradient). | The membrane is applied over the screed. Falls must be correct -- water must drain to the floor waste, not pond on the membrane. |
| **General floor levelling** | Any uneven areas of the bathroom floor levelled with screed or levelling compound. | Membrane applied to uneven substrate can crack or bridge over voids, leading to failure. |
| **Curing time** | Screed must be allowed to cure adequately before membrane application -- typically 24-48 hours minimum, or per manufacturer's instructions. New concrete substrates may require 7-28 days curing. | Moisture trapped under the membrane causes adhesion failure and blistering. |

### 3.5 Surface Condition -- Must Be Verified

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Clean** | Free from dust, loose particles, paint, oil, grease, curing compounds, and any contaminants that could impair membrane adhesion. |
| **Dry** | Substrate must be dry. Moisture content within acceptable range for the selected membrane system (check manufacturer's data sheet). |
| **Smooth** | No protrusions, sharp edges, voids, or formwork marks. Any defects must be filled and sanded smooth. |
| **Primed** | Primer applied as required by the membrane manufacturer for the specific substrate type (concrete, fibre cement, plasterboard, screed). |

**Scope-of-works implication:** The waterproofing scope should include a "site readiness" clause that lists these preconditions. If the waterproofer arrives and the site is not ready (e.g., plumbing rough-in incomplete, screed not cured), the homeowner should understand this will cause a return visit charge and schedule delay.

## 4. The Waterproofing Application Phase

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 4.1 Membrane Types Used in Australian Bathrooms

| Membrane Type | Description | Typical Application | Standard |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Liquid-applied (acrylic/polyurethane)** | Painted-on membrane, typically 2 coats. Most common in residential bathroom renovations. | Brush or roller applied to floors and walls. Reinforcing tape embedded at junctions. | AS/NZS 4858:2004 |
| **Sheet membrane** | Pre-formed waterproof sheet, adhered to substrate. | Used in areas requiring unbonded systems (e.g., over substrates with significant movement). | AS/NZS 4858:2004 |
| **Cementitious membrane** | Cement-based coating with waterproofing additives. | Less common in bathrooms. More typical for balconies and external wet areas. | AS/NZS 4858:2004 |

The vast majority of Australian bathroom renovations use **liquid-applied membranes** (brands such as Davco K10 Plus, Ardex WPM 310, Sika, Mapei). This is the assumed membrane type in the sequencing below.

### 4.2 Application Sequence

**Step 1: Bond breakers and corner fillets**
- Flexible silicone or polyurethane fillet applied to all internal corners (wall-to-floor, wall-to-wall, hob-to-floor, hob-to-wall junctions)
- Purpose: allows for structural movement without cracking the membrane
- Required by AS 3740:2021 and ABCB Housing Provisions

**Step 2: Primer**
- Applied to all surfaces that will receive membrane
- Primer type matched to substrate and membrane system (as per manufacturer's TDS)
- Typical drying time: 1-4 hours

**Step 3: First coat of membrane**
- Applied by brush, roller, or spray (spray is less common in residential renovation)
- Reinforcing tape (polyester or fiberglass mesh) embedded into the wet first coat at all junctions, corners, and penetrations
- Tape must overlap by minimum 50mm at joins
- Floor waste / puddle flange sealed with membrane and tape at this stage
- Typical wet film thickness per coat: 0.6-1.0mm

**Step 4: Drying between coats**
- Minimum 2-6 hours depending on product and conditions
- Must be touch-dry before second coat
- Do NOT force-dry with fans or heaters unless recommended by manufacturer

**Step 5: Second coat of membrane**
- Applied perpendicular to the first coat to ensure even coverage
- Total dry film thickness (DFT) after both coats: minimum 1.0-1.5mm (check product TDS)
- Additional coats may be required in high-risk areas (shower floor, hob junction)

**Step 6: Full cure**
- See Section 5 for detailed curing times

### 4.3 Coverage Areas (per AS 3740:2021)

| Area | Required Waterproofing | Minimum Height |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Shower floor (enclosed)** | Entire floor area within shower enclosure | To top of floor waste |
| **Shower walls (enclosed)** | All walls within shower enclosure | 1800mm above finished floor level, or 50mm above shower rose -- whichever is higher |
| **Shower floor (unenclosed / wet room)** | Entire bathroom floor | To top of floor waste |
| **Shower walls (unenclosed)** | Walls within 1500mm horizontal radius from shower rose connection | 1800mm above finished floor level, or 50mm above shower rose -- whichever is higher |
| **Bathroom floor (upper storey or timber subfloor)** | Entire floor area | To top of floor waste |
| **Bathroom floor (ground floor, concrete slab)** | May not be required for areas outside shower (check state requirements) | Where required, to top of floor waste |
| **Bath with shower over** | Floor and walls around bath | 1800mm above finished floor level on walls within shower spray zone |
| **Bathroom walls (outside shower)** | Within 150mm of wet fixtures (basin, bath) | 150mm above finished floor level |
| **Laundry floor** | Entire floor area (if upper storey or timber subfloor) | To top of floor waste |

**Confidence: HIGH** -- These requirements are drawn directly from AS 3740:2021 and NCC Housing Provisions Part 10.2.

## 5. Curing, Drying, and Flood Testing

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 5.1 Critical Distinction: Drying vs. Curing

This is a common source of confusion and mistakes on site.

| Term | Meaning | Typical Timeframe |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Drying time (between coats)** | Time until the membrane is touch-dry and ready to receive the next coat. The membrane is NOT fully waterproof at this stage. | 2-6 hours (varies by product, temperature, humidity) |
| **Drying time (final coat)** | Time until the final coat is touch-dry and can withstand light foot traffic for inspection. | 6-12 hours |
| **Full cure time** | Time until the membrane has reached its full waterproofing performance and can be tiled over. The membrane is chemically cross-linked and at full strength. | 24-72 hours (product-dependent) |
| **Full immersion cure** | Some products specify a longer period before full water immersion (e.g., shower in use). This is AFTER tiling. | Up to 7 days for some products |

### 5.2 Typical Curing Times by Product Type

| Product Category | Drying Between Coats | Final Dry (Before Inspection) | Full Cure (Before Tiling) |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Acrylic (e.g., Davco K10 Plus)** | 2-4 hours | 6 hours minimum | 24-48 hours |
| **Polyurethane (e.g., Ardex WPM 310)** | 4-6 hours | 12-24 hours | 48-72 hours |
| **Cementitious** | 4-8 hours | 12-24 hours | 48-72 hours |
| **Sheet membrane** | N/A (single application) | Adhesive cure time: 24 hours | 24-48 hours |

**Important:** These are indicative ranges. Always follow the specific manufacturer's technical data sheet (TDS) for the product being used. Environmental conditions significantly affect drying and curing:
- **Temperature:** Ideal range 10-30 degrees Celsius. Below 10 degrees, curing slows dramatically. Above 35 degrees, the membrane may skin over too fast, trapping solvents.
- **Humidity:** High humidity (>80%) extends drying time significantly.
- **Ventilation:** Adequate airflow accelerates drying. Enclosed bathrooms with no ventilation will take longer.

### 5.3 Flood Testing

Flood testing (also called ponding testing) is not mandatory for all bathroom renovations under AS 3740:2021, but it is best practice and may be required by the building surveyor, certifier, or project specification.

**Procedure:**
1. Block the floor waste (removable plug)
2. Block the doorway threshold (temporary dam)
3. Fill the shower recess (or entire bathroom floor) with potable water to 25-100mm depth at the low point
4. Mean water depth should not exceed 65mm
5. Mark the water level
6. Leave for a minimum of 24 hours (some specifications require 48 hours)
7. Check for any drop in water level
8. Inspect the area below (ceiling of the room below, if applicable) for any signs of moisture
9. If water level drops or leakage is detected: membrane has failed -- must be investigated and repaired

**Confidence: HIGH** -- Flood testing procedures are documented in AS 3740:2021 Appendix and manufacturer technical bulletins (e.g., Ardex TB266, Laticrete TDS-1169).

### 5.4 Total Waterproofing Phase Duration

| Scenario | Duration |
|----------|----------|
| **Standard bathroom (liquid-applied, no flood test)** | 2-3 days (application + curing) |
| **Standard bathroom (liquid-applied, with flood test)** | 4-5 days (application + curing + 24hr flood test) |
| **Large/complex bathroom or wet room** | 3-5 days (application + curing) |
| **Laundry (floor only, simple)** | 1-2 days |

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope must clearly state the expected duration for the waterproofing phase, including curing time. Homeowners often underestimate this -- they see "painting a coating on" and assume it takes a few hours. The curing/drying downtime is non-negotiable and cannot be rushed.

---

## 6. Inspection, Certification, and the Hold Point

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 6.1 The Hold Point Explained

A "hold point" means: **no subsequent work can proceed until this point is cleared.** In the context of waterproofing, this means:

- The tiler CANNOT start until the waterproofing has been inspected and a compliance certificate has been issued.
- If the tiler tiles over uncertified waterproofing, the work is non-compliant and may need to be demolished and re-done.
- The waterproofing certificate is a permanent record that the homeowner must retain for insurance, resale, and compliance purposes.

### 6.2 Who Inspects the Waterproofing?

The inspection and certification process varies by state, but follows this general pattern:

| Inspector | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **The licensed waterproofing contractor** | In most states, the waterproofing contractor who performed the work issues the compliance certificate. They self-certify that the work complies with AS 3740:2021 and the manufacturer's specifications. |
| **Building surveyor / certifier** | The building surveyor (private certifier or council) may inspect the waterproofing as part of the building permit process. In Victoria, this is not currently a mandatory inspection stage but surveyors have the power to request it under Section 35 of the Building Act 1993. Proposed legislation may make it mandatory. |
| **Independent waterproofing inspector** | For higher-value projects or strata work, an independent waterproofing inspector may be engaged to provide a third-party assessment before the certificate is issued. |

### 6.3 What Is Checked During Inspection?

| Inspection Item | What the Inspector Verifies |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Coverage completeness** | Membrane covers all required areas per AS 3740:2021 (floor, walls to required heights, hob, niche) |
| **Dry film thickness (DFT)** | Membrane meets minimum DFT specified by manufacturer (typically 1.0-1.5mm). May be checked with a DFT gauge. |
| **Pinholes and defects** | No pinholes, tears, thin spots, blistering, or delamination |
| **Junction treatment** | Reinforcing tape properly embedded at all wall-floor, wall-wall, hob-wall, and hob-floor junctions |
| **Bond breaker / fillets** | Flexible fillet installed at all internal corners before membrane application |
| **Floor waste integration** | Membrane properly sealed to puddle flange / floor waste. No gaps. |
| **Penetration sealing** | All pipe penetrations through the membrane properly sealed |
| **Wall termination heights** | Shower walls waterproofed to 1800mm or 50mm above shower rose (whichever higher) |
| **Vertical termination** | Membrane terminates cleanly at correct height with adequate adhesion |
| **Product compliance** | Membrane product complies with AS/NZS 4858:2004 |
| **Substrate preparation** | Evidence of correct substrate preparation (smooth, clean, primed) |

### 6.4 The Waterproofing Certificate

The waterproofing compliance certificate typically documents:

- Property address
- Date of application
- Licensed waterproofing contractor details (name, license number, ABN)
- Membrane product used (brand, product name, batch number)
- Areas waterproofed (with diagram or markup)
- Confirmation of compliance with AS 3740:2021
- Confirmation of compliance with manufacturer's specifications
- Signature of licensed waterproofer

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 6.5 Timing: Can the Tiler Start the Same Day?

**Short answer: It depends on curing time, not inspection time.**

The inspection itself is typically quick -- 30 minutes to 1 hour for a standard bathroom. Same-day inspection reports are available from many providers.

However, the constraint is usually curing time, not inspection time:
- The membrane must be fully cured before tiling (24-72 hours after final coat)
- The inspection can only happen after the membrane is cured (you cannot inspect a membrane that is still drying)
- Therefore, the earliest the tiler can start is typically the day AFTER the inspection, assuming the membrane was applied 2-3 days prior

**Typical timeline:**
```
Day 1: Waterproofing -- primer + first coat
Day 2: Waterproofing -- second coat (morning)
Day 3: Curing (no site work -- membrane must not be disturbed)
Day 4: Inspection and certification (morning). Tiling can commence same afternoon IF:
        - Certificate is issued (no defects found)
        - Membrane is fully cured per manufacturer's specifications
        - Flood test is not required (flood test adds another 24-48 hours)
```

**If flood test is required:**
```
Day 1: Waterproofing -- primer + first coat
Day 2: Waterproofing -- second coat
Day 3: Full cure
Day 4: Flood test begins (fill with water, leave 24 hours)
Day 5: Flood test result. Inspection. Certificate issued.
Day 6: Tiling can commence (if membrane cured and flood test passed)
```

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope should include the expected number of days for the waterproofing phase (including curing and inspection) so the homeowner understands the timeline impact. A common complaint is "why is nothing happening for 2 days?" -- the answer is curing time.

## 7. What Happens If Trades Return After Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

This is the most important sequencing risk in any wet-area renovation. If a trade (most commonly a plumber or electrician) needs to modify something after the waterproofing membrane has been applied, the consequences are severe.

### 7.1 The Problem

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| **Plumber needs to move a pipe** | Pipe is embedded in the floor or wall behind the membrane. Cutting, drilling, or chiselling to access the pipe punctures the membrane. The membrane in that area is now compromised. |
| **Electrician needs to add/move a cable** | Cable chased into wall that is now waterproofed. Chasing into the wall cuts through the membrane. |
| **Plumber needs to adjust floor waste height** | Floor waste is sealed into the membrane system. Adjusting height requires breaking the seal. |
| **Builder needs to modify shower hob** | Hob is waterproofed on all surfaces. Modifying the hob tears the membrane. |

### 7.2 The Consequences

**Any penetration of the membrane after application requires remediation.** The options are:

| Remediation Option | When Appropriate | Cost Impact | Time Impact |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Localised patch repair** | Small, isolated penetration (e.g., single screw hole). Waterproofer can patch the area with additional membrane and tape. | $200-$500 for waterproofer return visit | 1-2 days (patch + cure) |
| **Section re-application** | Larger area compromised (e.g., section of floor where pipe was moved). Strip back membrane in affected area, re-prep, re-apply. | $500-$2,000 depending on area | 2-4 days (strip + re-apply + cure) |
| **Full re-waterproofing** | Widespread damage or loss of confidence in membrane integrity. If the tiler has already tiled over the membrane, tiles must be removed first. | $1,200-$8,500 for membrane alone. If tiles must be removed: $5,000-$15,000+ total. | 3-7 days (demolition of tiles if applicable + full re-waterproofing + cure) |

### 7.3 Who Pays?

- If the plumber or electrician was instructed to complete their rough-in before waterproofing and failed to do so, the cost of re-waterproofing should be borne by the trade who caused the issue (or their insurer).
- If the homeowner made a late change request (e.g., "actually, can we move the shower mixer 200mm to the left?") after waterproofing, the homeowner bears the cost.
- If a builder/project manager scheduled trades out of sequence, the builder bears the cost.

**Scope-of-works implication:** The waterproofing scope should include a clear warning: "Any penetration of the waterproof membrane by subsequent trades will require remediation at additional cost and will delay the project. All plumbing and electrical rough-in must be 100% complete and inspected before waterproofing commences."

### 7.4 How to Prevent This

1. **Do not waterproof until plumbing and electrical rough-in are signed off.** The plumber and electrician should physically confirm "we are done, no further work required behind walls or in floors."
2. **Photograph the rough-in before waterproofing.** This provides a record of pipe and cable positions in case future maintenance is needed.
3. **Confirm all fixture selections before rough-in.** Changing the shower mixer brand after rough-in may require repositioning. Changing the toilet after rough-in may require different set-out distances.
4. **No changes after waterproofing.** The homeowner must understand that once the membrane is applied, the layout is locked in. Changes at this point are extremely costly.

## 8. In-Floor Heating Coordination

**Confidence: HIGH**

In-floor (underfloor) heating in bathrooms is increasingly popular in Australian renovations, particularly in southern states (VIC, TAS, SA, ACT). It creates a significant coordination point with waterproofing because the heating element and the membrane must be layered correctly.

### 8.1 Two Types of In-Floor Heating Systems

| System Type | Description | Placement Relative to Membrane |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **In-screed cable** | Heating cable embedded within the sand/cement screed layer. Thicker system. | Cable is installed BEFORE waterproofing -- it sits within the screed, and the membrane goes OVER the screed (and therefore over the cable). |
| **Thin mat (electric mat)** | Ultra-thin heating mat adhered directly to the floor surface. Tiles are laid directly over the mat using tile adhesive. | Mat is installed AFTER waterproofing -- it sits ON TOP of the cured membrane, and tiles are laid over the mat. |

### 8.2 The Key Rule

**The waterproof membrane must always be a continuous, unbroken layer.** The heating element must not compromise the membrane.

- **In-screed cable:** The cable is encased in the screed. The membrane is applied over the cured screed. The cable never touches the membrane. Sequencing: Cable > Screed > Cure > Waterproofing > Cure > Tiling.
- **Thin mat:** The mat is laid over the cured membrane using hot-melt glue or double-sided tape (no mechanical fixings that would puncture the membrane). Tiles are then laid over the mat using flexible tile adhesive. Sequencing: Screed > Cure > Waterproofing > Cure > Mat Installation > Tiling.

### 8.3 Coordination Between Electrician and Waterproofer

| Stage | Electrician's Responsibility | Waterproofer's Responsibility |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Before waterproofing** | Install all wiring runs to the thermostat location. For in-screed systems: lay heating cable in screed. For mat systems: ensure power supply cable is in position (but do NOT lay the mat yet). | Verify that the screed (with cable, if applicable) is fully cured. Inspect for any protruding cable ends or junction boxes that could interfere with membrane application. |
| **During waterproofing** | No work required on site. | Apply membrane over the entire floor area including over the in-screed cable (now encased in screed). Ensure membrane coverage is continuous. |
| **After waterproofing (mat systems only)** | Return to install the heating mat on top of the cured membrane. Adhere with hot-melt glue or tape -- NO screws, nails, or staples. Connect cold tail to thermostat location. Test the system before tiling covers it. | Inspect the installed mat to verify it has not damaged the membrane. Any punctures require repair before tiling. |
| **After tiling** | Final connection to thermostat. Commission and test the system. Issue compliance certificate. | No further involvement. |

### 8.4 Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Laying mat UNDER the membrane** | Mat is sandwiched between screed and membrane. Heat from the mat can cause membrane delamination over time. Some membrane manufacturers explicitly void their warranty if the mat is placed under the membrane. |
| **Using mechanical fixings to attach the mat** | Screws or staples through the membrane create punctures. Water enters through these holes, defeating the waterproofing. |
| **Not testing the heating system before tiling** | If the heating element is faulty, discovering this after tiling means demolishing tiles to replace the mat. Always test before the tiler starts. |
| **In-screed cable not fully encased** | Cable protruding from the screed creates a bump under the membrane, causing thin spots or voids in the membrane. Cable must be fully flush with the screed surface. |

**Scope-of-works implication:** If the project includes in-floor heating, the waterproofing scope must specify the system type and confirm the correct sequencing. The scope should note: "Thin mat heating systems to be installed AFTER waterproofing membrane has fully cured. In-screed cable systems to be installed BEFORE screeding and waterproofing."

## 9. Screed and Falls -- Who Does What

**Confidence: MEDIUM** -- This varies by region and by the individual trades involved. The responsibility for screeding is not universally assigned to one trade in Australia.

### 9.1 The Screeding Question

Screeding (applying a sand/cement layer to create the correct floor falls toward the floor waste) is a task that sits at the intersection of multiple trades. Different practitioners have different views on who should do it.

| Trade | Case for Them Doing Screeding |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **Tiler** | Most commonly responsible in practice. The tiler understands the finished floor level and needs the falls to be correct for their tile layout. Many tilers prefer to screed themselves because they control the final result. |
| **Waterproofer** | Some waterproofers prefer to screed as well, because they need the substrate to be at the correct fall before applying the membrane. Combining screeding and waterproofing under one contractor reduces coordination risk. |
| **Builder / Carpenter** | In some projects, the builder's labourer handles screeding as part of general site preparation. Less common in renovation (more common in new builds). |
| **Plumber** | The plumber sets the floor waste at the correct height but does NOT typically do the screeding. However, the plumber must confirm the floor waste height is compatible with the planned screed thickness and falls. |

### 9.2 The Membrane-Screed Positioning Question

**Confidence: MEDIUM** -- Regional variation exists.

In Australia, there are two accepted approaches to the relationship between the waterproof membrane and the screed:

| Approach | Membrane Position | Common In | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| **Membrane UNDER screed** | Membrane applied to structural substrate. Screed laid on top. Tiles on top of screed. | NSW, QLD, VIC (traditional) | Membrane is protected from tile installation damage. Drainage occurs within the screed/tile bed layer. | Membrane is harder to inspect after screed is applied. Leaks travel laterally within the screed layer before appearing. |
| **Membrane OVER screed** | Screed laid on structural substrate with falls. Membrane applied on top of cured screed. Tiles on top of membrane. | TAS, SA, some VIC practitioners | Membrane is the last layer before tiles -- easier to inspect. Leaks are detected immediately. Falls are established before membrane. | Membrane is more exposed to damage during tiling. |

**AS 3740:2021 permits both approaches.** The choice depends on the membrane system, the applicator's preference, and regional practice. For the purpose of ScopeAI's scope-of-works generation, the most common approach (and the one assumed in the sequencing template) is **membrane OVER screed** -- screed first, then waterproofing on top.

### 9.3 Fall Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Minimum fall to floor waste** | 1:80 to 1:100 (NCC Housing Provisions) |
| **Maximum fall to floor waste** | 1:50 (steeper than this feels uncomfortable underfoot and tiles may not sit flat) |
| **Direction** | Falls must be toward the floor waste from the furthest point of the wet area |
| **Tolerance** | No ponding permitted -- water must not collect anywhere on the floor surface other than at the floor waste |

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope should specify who is responsible for screeding and falls. If the waterproofing contractor includes screeding in their scope, it should be explicitly listed as a line item. If screeding is excluded, the scope should note "screed to falls by others -- must be complete and cured before waterproofing can commence."

## 10. Trade Coordination Table

**Confidence: HIGH**

The following table shows every trade that interfaces with waterproofing, what they must complete before and/or after waterproofing, and common coordination failures.

| Trade | Must Complete BEFORE Waterproofing | Must Complete AFTER Waterproofing | Common Coordination Failure |
|-------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Demolition** | Full strip-out of old tiles, fixtures, fittings, and existing membrane. Substrate clean and ready. | N/A | Failure to fully remove old membrane, causing adhesion problems with new membrane. |
| **Plumber (rough-in)** | All waste pipes, water supply pipes, floor waste/puddle flange, shower mixer body installed at final position. Pressure tested. | N/A | Plumber forgets to install puddle flange, or installs floor waste at wrong height. Waterproofer cannot proceed until corrected. |
| **Plumber (final fix)** | N/A | Install all fixtures (taps, toilet, basin waste, shower head) AFTER tiling is complete. Connect to capped rough-in points. | Plumber returns before tiling is complete to "get ahead." Damages membrane or freshly tiled surfaces. |
| **Electrician (rough-in)** | All wiring chased into walls/floors. In-floor heating cable installed (if in-screed type). Exhaust fan ducting run. | N/A | Electrician needs to add a GPO after waterproofing is done. Must cut through membrane. Requires patch repair. |
| **Electrician (mat install)** | N/A (if thin mat system) | Install heating mat ON TOP of cured membrane. Connect cold tail. Test system. Must be done BEFORE tiling. | Electrician lays mat with staples or screws, puncturing the membrane. |
| **Electrician (final fix)** | N/A | Install downlights, exhaust fan, heated towel rail connection, GPO covers. After tiling. | N/A -- typically no conflict at this stage. |
| **Builder / Carpenter** | Construct shower hob. Frame shower niche. Install water-resistant plasterboard on walls. Substrate smooth and flush. | N/A | Hob not properly sealed to floor or wall. Membrane application fails at the junction. |
| **Screeder (tiler/waterproofer/builder)** | Lay screed with correct falls. Allow to cure (24-48 hours minimum). | N/A | Screed not cured adequately. Moisture causes membrane blistering and adhesion failure. |
| **Tiler** | N/A | Can ONLY commence AFTER waterproofing certificate is issued and membrane is fully cured. | Tiler starts before certificate is issued (under pressure to "keep things moving"). If waterproofing fails, tiles must be removed. |
| **Painter** | N/A | Paint ceiling and walls above tile line AFTER tiling, plumbing final fix, and electrical final fix. | Painter works before final fix trades, requiring touch-ups after fixtures are installed. Minor issue, not waterproofing-related. |
| **Shower screen installer** | N/A | Install AFTER tiling and siliconing. Bracket positions must not penetrate the waterproofed zone below tile line. | Installer drills bracket holes through tiles into waterproofed area. If below 150mm from floor level, membrane could be compromised. Brackets should be positioned above the waterproofed wall zone or sealed with appropriate sealant. |

### Critical Path Identification

The critical path through a bathroom renovation runs directly through waterproofing:

```
Demo (2-3d) → Rough-in (2-3d) → Hob/Screed (2-3d) → WATERPROOFING (2-5d) → Tiling (3-5d) → Fix (2-3d)
                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                        This is the bottleneck.
                                                        Cannot be compressed.
                                                        Curing time is fixed.
```

Total critical path: **13-22 working days** (approximately 3-5 weeks)

## 12. Common Sequencing Failures

**Confidence: HIGH**

The following are the most common sequencing failures observed in Australian bathroom renovations, specifically related to waterproofing coordination.

### Failure 1: Plumber Not Finished Before Waterproofer Arrives

**What happens:** The waterproofer arrives on the scheduled day. The plumber has not installed the puddle flange, or the shower mixer is not in position, or a waste pipe is in the wrong location.

**Consequence:** Waterproofer cannot proceed. Return visit required (typically $200-$500 call-out fee). Project delayed 2-5 days while plumber completes work and waterproofer is rescheduled.

**Prevention:** Builder/project manager must confirm plumbing rough-in is 100% complete and signed off BEFORE booking the waterproofer.

### Failure 2: Screed Not Cured

**What happens:** The screeder finishes late in the day. The waterproofer is booked for the next morning. The screed has only had 12 hours to cure.

**Consequence:** Membrane applied to damp screed. Moisture trapped under the membrane causes blistering and delamination. Membrane fails. Must be stripped and re-applied.

**Prevention:** Allow minimum 24-48 hours between screeding completion and waterproofing commencement. In cold or humid conditions, allow more time.

### Failure 3: Tiler Starts Before Certificate Is Issued

**What happens:** The tiler is under schedule pressure and begins tiling the day after waterproofing, before the inspector has attended or the certificate has been issued.

**Consequence:** If the membrane fails inspection (e.g., insufficient thickness, missed areas, junction defects), the tiles must be removed to remediate the membrane. Cost: $3,000-$10,000+ depending on extent of tiling already done.

**Prevention:** Tiling must NEVER commence without a waterproofing compliance certificate. This should be a contractual requirement.

### Failure 4: Homeowner Changes Fixture Position After Waterproofing

**What happens:** The homeowner decides to move the shower mixer, relocate the floor waste, or add a second basin after the membrane has been applied.

**Consequence:** Any of these changes requires modifying the plumbing rough-in behind the membrane. Membrane must be cut open, plumbing modified, and membrane repaired or re-applied. Cost: $1,000-$5,000+ depending on the change.

**Prevention:** Finalise ALL fixture positions and selections BEFORE plumbing rough-in. Lock in layout before waterproofing. No changes after membrane is applied.

### Failure 5: Electrician Returns After Waterproofing

**What happens:** The electrician forgot to run a cable for the heated towel rail, or the homeowner adds a new GPO after the membrane is applied.

**Consequence:** Cable must be chased into the wall, cutting through the membrane. Membrane must be patched. If not patched correctly, the wall leaks behind the tiles for years before being detected.

**Prevention:** Complete electrical rough-in checklist BEFORE waterproofing. Verify every circuit is in place.

### Failure 6: Shower Hob Not Properly Secured

**What happens:** The shower hob is loosely placed but not structurally fixed to the floor. The waterproofer applies the membrane over the hob. During use, the hob shifts slightly, cracking the membrane at the hob-floor junction.

**Consequence:** Slow leak at the hob junction. Water enters the subfloor. Damage may not be noticed for months or years. Eventually requires full demolition and re-waterproofing.

**Prevention:** Hob must be structurally fixed with construction adhesive and mechanical fixings. All gaps between hob and floor/walls must be filled and sealed before waterproofing.

### Failure 7: No Bond Breakers at Junctions

**What happens:** The waterproofer applies the membrane directly into internal corners without installing bond breakers (flexible fillets). Building movement causes stress at the rigid corner junction. Membrane cracks.

**Consequence:** Water enters through the crack at the junction. Leak develops behind tiles. Full re-waterproofing of the affected area required.

**Prevention:** Bond breakers (flexible silicone or polyurethane fillets) must be installed at ALL internal corners and junctions before membrane application. This is a requirement of AS 3740:2021.

## 13. State-by-State Licensing and Certification

**Confidence: HIGH for NSW, QLD, VIC. MEDIUM for other states.**

### 13.1 Licensing Requirements

| State/Territory | Licensing Authority | Licence Required? | Threshold | Key Notes |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **NSW** | NSW Fair Trading | Yes -- mandatory | Work valued over $5,000 (incl. GST) | Only licensed waterproofers can issue compliance certificates. Homeowner DIY is prohibited in wet areas. |
| **QLD** | QBCC (Queensland Building and Construction Commission) | Yes -- mandatory | Work valued over $3,300 (incl. GST) | Licensed QBCC practitioners must execute work and provide compliance documentation. |
| **VIC** | Victorian Building Authority (VBA) | Yes -- mandatory | Work valued over $5,000 (incl. GST) | Certified plumbers must lodge compliance certificates within 5 business days. Proposed legislation may introduce mandatory pre-tiling inspection by building surveyor. |
| **WA** | Building Services Board | Recommended | Work valued over $20,000 (incl. GST) | Higher threshold than eastern states. Licensed professionals recommended but not always mandatory for lower-value work. |
| **SA** | Consumer and Business Services | Recommended | Varies | Licensed professionals recommended. Compliance certificates typically required. |
| **TAS** | Consumer, Building and Occupational Services | Recommended | Varies | Licensed professionals recommended. |
| **ACT** | Access Canberra | Recommended | Varies | Licensed professionals recommended. |
| **NT** | NT Building Advisory Services | Recommended | Varies | Licensed professionals recommended. |

### 13.2 Required Qualification

To obtain a waterproofing licence in Australia, the practitioner must hold:

- **CPC31420 -- Certificate III in Construction Waterproofing** (or equivalent predecessor qualification CPC31411)
- This covers liquid-applied membranes, sheet membranes, cementitious coatings, and associated preparation and testing

### 13.3 Certificate Retention

The waterproofing compliance certificate should be retained permanently by the homeowner. It is required for:

- Final building inspection (if building permit was obtained)
- Home and contents insurance claims related to water damage
- Property sale (buyers and their building inspectors will request it)
- Strata/body corporate compliance (for apartments and townhouses)
- Warranty claims on waterproofing products (manufacturers require proof of licensed installation)

**Scope-of-works implication:** The waterproofing scope should state the contractor's licence number and confirm that a compliance certificate will be issued upon satisfactory completion and inspection. The scope should also note the homeowner's obligation to retain the certificate.
