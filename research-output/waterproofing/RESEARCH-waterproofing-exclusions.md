# Waterproofing Scope Research — Section 4: Common Exclusions
## Australian Residential Renovations

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Reference document for AI scope-of-works generator (ScopeAI) — Section 4: Common Exclusions from a waterproofing scope of work
**Coverage:** Bathroom, laundry, kitchen, and other wet area waterproofing exclusions in residential renovation scopes across all Australian states and territories
**Target Audience:** AI prompt system that generates trade-specific scope-of-works documents for Australian homeowners

**Confidence Notes:**
- **HIGH** — Items marked HIGH are based on established Australian trade practice, statutory requirements, published standards (AS 3740:2021, NCC 2025), state regulator guidance (NSW Fair Trading, VBA, QBCC), and multiple corroborating industry sources.
- **MEDIUM** — Items marked MEDIUM are based on common industry practice confirmed by trade publications and renovation cost guides, but may vary by region, waterproofer, or contract type.
- **LOW** — Items marked LOW are based on general industry knowledge where published Australian-specific sources are limited; treated as reasonable estimates pending further verification.

> **Why this section is critical:** Waterproofing is the single most failure-prone trade in Australian residential construction. More than 80% of post-renovation leak complaints involve membrane failure, and waterproofing issues account for a majority of defect reports to the VBA and national building regulatory bodies. The exclusions section of a waterproofing scope is essential for preventing disputes because waterproofing sits at the intersection of multiple trades — plumbing, carpentry, tiling, electrical, and building. Every one of those trades must complete specific work before the waterproofer arrives, and specific work after the waterproofer finishes. Misunderstandings about who does what cost Australian homeowners between $3,000 and $25,000 in repair bills. A well-drafted exclusions section protects both the homeowner (who can budget accurately and coordinate trades properly) and the waterproofer (who is not expected to deliver work outside their licence). The AI scope generator must include clear, explicit exclusions in every waterproofing scope it produces.

## 4.1 Screed and Fall Preparation

### What It Is

Screeding is the process of laying a sand-cement bed (typically 25–40mm thick) over the bathroom floor substrate to create the correct drainage falls toward floor waste outlets. AS 3740:2021 and the NCC require a minimum fall of 1:80 (12.5mm per metre) in general wet area floors and 1:80 to 1:60 in shower recesses, ensuring water flows to the drain and does not pond on surfaces.

### Why It Is Commonly Excluded

Screed preparation is one of the most variable items in a waterproofing scope. Sometimes the waterproofer does it. Sometimes the tiler does it. Sometimes a dedicated screeder is engaged. The answer depends on:

1. **Membrane placement strategy:** In NSW, QLD, and VIC, the most common commercial practice (approx. 80% of projects) is to apply the membrane *under* the screed, meaning the waterproofer membranes first, then the tiler or screeder lays the screed bed on top. In TAS and SA, the convention is often membrane *over* the screed. Best practice (and increasingly common in quality renovations) is waterproofing both above and below the screed for double protection.

2. **Who holds the licence:** In many states, screeding does not require a separate licence — it is considered part of general building or tiling work. The waterproofer may or may not include it, depending on their business model.

3. **Cost variability:** Screed material and labour for a standard bathroom (4–6 m2) runs $400–$800 depending on thickness and complexity. Some waterproofers include a basic screed in their price; others exclude it entirely.

### Which Trade Is Responsible

| Scenario | Responsible Trade | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Membrane under screed (most common in NSW/QLD/VIC) | Tiler or screeder lays screed *over* completed membrane | Waterproofer membranes first; tiler/screeder sets falls on top |
| Membrane over screed (common in TAS/SA) | Screeder or tiler lays screed first; waterproofer membranes on top | Falls must be set *before* the waterproofer arrives |
| Dual membrane (best practice) | First membrane by waterproofer, then screed by tiler/screeder, then second membrane by waterproofer | Most expensive but most robust; increasingly recommended |

### Interface / Handoff Point

- If the waterproofer is membraning *under* the screed: the substrate must be clean, dry, structurally sound, and free of debris before the waterproofer arrives. The screed is laid after the membrane cures.
- If the waterproofer is membraning *over* the screed: the screed must be fully cured (minimum 7 days), have correct falls verified, and be clean and dry before the waterproofer arrives.
- In both cases, floor waste positions and puddle flanges must be installed and set to the correct height before screeding or waterproofing begins.

### Common Disputes

- **Homeowner assumes screed is included:** Many homeowners see "waterproofing" and assume it includes the floor bed. If the quote says "waterproof membrane application to prepared surfaces," the screed is explicitly excluded.
- **Falls are wrong:** If the tiler/screeder sets incorrect falls, water ponds. The waterproofer is not responsible for checking or correcting falls set by another trade — but they should refuse to membrane over a surface with obvious fall defects.
- **Screed cracks the membrane:** If screed is laid too soon over a membrane (before full cure) or too aggressively, it can damage the waterproofing layer. Clear handoff timing is essential.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- Does the quote explicitly state whether screed/fall preparation is **included or excluded**?
- If included, does it specify the fall gradient and the method?
- If excluded, does it state who is responsible and what condition the substrate must be in before the waterproofer attends?

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.2 Plumbing Rough-In

### What It Is

Plumbing rough-in is the installation of all concealed pipework — hot and cold water supply lines, drainage pipes (waste and sewer), gas lines (if applicable), and associated fittings — before walls are lined and floors are finished. In a bathroom renovation, this includes relocating or installing new waste points for the shower, bath, basin, and toilet, plus water supply points for all fixtures.

### Why It Is Excluded

Plumbing rough-in is a licensed plumber's scope of work. It must be completed **before** the waterproofer arrives because:

1. **Penetrations must be in place:** Every pipe that passes through the floor or wall creates a penetration point. The waterproofer must seal around these penetrations with the membrane system. If plumbing rough-in happens after waterproofing, the plumber will cut through the membrane and destroy the waterproof barrier.

2. **Puddle flanges and floor wastes must be set:** The plumber sets the floor waste and puddle flanges to the correct height relative to the finished floor level. The waterproofer then membranes over and into these flanges.

3. **Separate licence requirement:** Plumbing work in all Australian states requires a licensed plumber. A waterproofer cannot legally perform plumbing work (and vice versa — a plumber cannot legally waterproof unless they hold a separate waterproofing licence).

### Which Trade Is Responsible

Licensed plumber, exclusively. No exceptions.

### Interface / Handoff Point

The plumber must complete ALL of the following before the waterproofer attends:

| Plumber Completes | Before Waterproofer Can |
|---|---|
| All waste pipes installed to final position | Apply membrane around waste penetrations |
| All water supply rough-in behind walls | Line walls and prepare for membrane |
| Puddle flanges installed and set to correct height | Membrane over flanges and create waterproof seal |
| Floor waste set to correct height for screed/tile level | Build up membrane to waste connection |
| Pressure test on water supply lines | Proceed without risk of rework through membrane |
| Drainage test (if required by council/certifier) | Proceed without risk of rework through membrane |

### Common Disputes

- **Plumber comes back after waterproofing:** The most destructive dispute scenario. If the plumber needs to modify or add a pipe after the membrane is applied, they must cut through the membrane. The entire waterproofing for that area may need to be redone. Responsibility for the cost of re-waterproofing falls on whoever caused the rework — usually the plumber or the project manager who sequenced the work incorrectly.
- **Incorrect waste heights:** If the plumber sets waste points at the wrong height, the waterproofer cannot achieve a proper seal. The plumber must rectify before waterproofing proceeds.
- **Missing penetrations:** If the homeowner adds a fixture (e.g., a bidet, additional basin) after plumbing rough-in is complete, a new penetration is needed, potentially requiring re-waterproofing.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- The waterproofing quote should state: "All plumbing rough-in to be completed by licensed plumber prior to waterproofing. Waterproofer accepts no responsibility for plumbing defects or rework required after membrane application."
- The plumbing quote should include rough-in to all required positions, with puddle flange supply and installation specified.

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.3 Puddle Flanges

### What It Is

A puddle flange (also called a drainage flange or waterproofing flange) is a metal or plastic collar that sits around a floor waste outlet at floor level. Its purpose is to provide a surface that the waterproofing membrane can bond to, creating a continuous waterproof seal from the floor membrane into the drainage system. Without a puddle flange, the junction between the floor membrane and the drain pipe is the weakest point in the entire waterproofing system and the most common point of failure.

Puddle flanges are required by AS 3740:2021 at all floor waste locations in waterproofed areas.

### Why This Is a Common Source of Confusion

Puddle flanges sit at the exact interface between plumbing and waterproofing — they connect to the plumber's drainage pipe but must be sealed with the waterproofer's membrane. This dual-trade interface creates persistent confusion about supply and installation responsibility.

### Who Supplies and Installs — The Industry Reality

| Aspect | Most Common Practice | Alternative Practice |
|---|---|---|
| **Supply** | Plumber supplies as part of drainage rough-in | Waterproofer supplies (less common) |
| **Installation to waste pipe** | Plumber installs and connects to PVC waste pipe | — |
| **Setting to correct height** | Plumber sets to finished floor level (accounting for screed + tile thickness) | Tiler or waterproofer adjusts height |
| **Membrane seal to flange** | Waterproofer applies membrane over and into the flange | — |
| **Final height check** | Shared responsibility — plumber sets it, waterproofer/tiler confirms before membraning | — |

### The Consensus View

The most commonly cited Australian industry position is:

> "The plumber installs the puddle flange and connects it to the waste pipe. The waterproofer seals the membrane to the flange."

However, there is genuine disagreement:
- Some plumbers insist that puddle flange installation is the waterproofer's or tiler's responsibility.
- Some waterproofers insist the plumber must have the flange installed and at the correct height before they attend.
- The Localsearch trade guide and multiple Whirlpool forum discussions confirm this is one of the most disputed trade interfaces in Australian bathroom renovations.

### The Correct Approach for Scope Documents

The safest approach is to specify responsibility explicitly in both the plumbing and waterproofing scopes:

**In the plumbing scope:**
> "Supply and install puddle flanges to all floor waste locations. Set flanges to correct height for finished floor level (confirm tile + screed thickness with tiler before installation)."

**In the waterproofing scope:**
> "Apply waterproofing membrane over and into puddle flanges at all floor waste locations. Puddle flanges to be installed by plumber and set to correct height prior to waterproofing. Waterproofer to verify flanges are flush with substrate before membrane application."

### Common Disputes

- **Flange not flush with floor:** If the puddle flange sits above the finished screed level, the waterproofer cannot create a proper seal and water will pool around the waste. The plumber or screeder must correct this.
- **Flange too low:** If the flange is set too low, the membrane has to bridge a gap. This creates a failure point.
- **No flange installed at all:** In some older renovations, the plumber skips the puddle flange entirely (relying on the tiler to "just seal it"). This is non-compliant with AS 3740:2021 and is a guaranteed future leak.
- **Wrong flange type:** Puddle flanges must be compatible with both the waste pipe diameter (typically 50mm, 80mm, or 100mm) and the waterproofing membrane system being used. If the plumber installs one type and the waterproofer uses an incompatible membrane system, the seal will fail.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- Is puddle flange supply and installation explicitly mentioned in either the plumbing or waterproofing quote?
- If neither quote mentions it, ask. Do not assume it is included.
- Modern alternatives (e.g., Wondercap, Puddle Pro) that sit on top of the screed are increasingly popular and may simplify the interface — but someone must still be responsible for supply and installation.

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.4 Tiling

### What It Is

Tiling is the installation of ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, or other tile products over waterproofed and prepared surfaces. Tiling is a separate licensed trade (in states that require it) and is always performed **after** waterproofing is complete and cured.

### Why It Is Excluded

Tiling is a fundamentally different trade from waterproofing:

1. **Separate skill set and licence:** Tiling requires its own qualifications and, in some states, a separate licence class (e.g., QBCC Wall and Floor Tiling licence in QLD).
2. **Different timing:** Tiling cannot commence until the waterproofing membrane has fully cured (minimum 24–72 hours depending on membrane type, temperature, and humidity).
3. **Different materials:** Tile adhesive, grout, and tiles are tiling materials — not waterproofing materials. While some tile adhesive systems have waterproofing properties, they are not a substitute for a compliant membrane system.

### Which Trade Is Responsible

Licensed tiler. Some waterproofers also hold tiling licences and offer combined waterproofing + tiling packages. In this case, the quote should clearly delineate the waterproofing scope from the tiling scope.

### Interface / Handoff Point

| Waterproofer Completes | Before Tiler Can |
|---|---|
| Full membrane application to floors, walls, hobs, and junctions | Commence tile adhesive application |
| Membrane fully cured (24–72 hrs minimum) | Apply tiles without compromising membrane |
| Flood test completed and passed (if required) | Confirm waterproof barrier is intact |
| Compliance certificate issued | Tile with confidence (and for certifier records) |

| Tiler Must | To Protect Waterproofing |
|---|---|
| Not puncture or damage the membrane during tiling | Use appropriate adhesive and avoid mechanical fixings through membrane |
| Use membrane-compatible tile adhesive | Incompatible adhesives can delaminate from the membrane |
| Maintain correct falls set in screed | Tiles must follow the established drainage gradient |
| Seal tile-to-wall and tile-to-floor junctions with flexible silicone | Rigid grout in movement joints will crack |

### Common Disputes

- **Tiler damages membrane:** Dropping heavy tiles, dragging equipment, or using incorrect fixings can puncture the membrane. If the tiler damages the membrane, the waterproofer should be recalled to repair it before tiling continues — at the tiler's or project manager's cost.
- **Tiler tiles over uncertified waterproofing:** Tiling should not commence until the waterproofing certificate is issued. If it does and a defect is later found, the tiles must be removed to re-waterproof — a costly exercise.
- **Homeowner assumes tiling is included in waterproofing quote:** A waterproofing quote of $800–$1,500 for a standard bathroom does not include tiling, which typically costs $1,500–$4,000+ depending on tile type and layout complexity.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- The waterproofing quote should clearly state: "Tiling excluded. Tiling to be performed by licensed tiler after membrane has fully cured."
- If a combined waterproofing + tiling quote is provided, ensure both scopes are itemised separately with separate line items.

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.5 Hob and Shower Base Construction

### What It Is

A hob (also called a shower kerb, shower curb, or shower step) is the raised lip at the entry to a shower recess that prevents water from flowing out onto the general bathroom floor. Hobs are typically constructed from brick, concrete block, or cement mortar, built to a minimum height that satisfies AS 3740:2021 requirements. A shower base (or shower floor) may also be formed from a sand-cement bed with correct falls, or a pre-formed acrylic/tile tray.

Under AS 3740:2021, hobs must be at least the height of the finished floor level outside the shower (plus any additional height required by the specific waterproofing system). The hob must be waterproofed as an integral part of the shower waterproofing system — it is not a separate waterproofing element.

### Why It Is Excluded

Hob and shower base construction is **building/carpentry/masonry work**, not waterproofing work:

1. **Structural element:** The hob is a small masonry structure that must be securely fixed to the floor and sealed against walls. This is builder, carpenter, or bricklayer work.
2. **Must be built before waterproofing:** The hob must be in place, fully cured (minimum 7 days for mortar), and structurally sound before the waterproofer can apply the membrane over it.
3. **Height and dimensions critical:** The hob height must account for finished floor level inside and outside the shower (including screed + tile thickness). Incorrect hob height is a common defect.

### Which Trade Is Responsible

| Element | Responsible Trade |
|---|---|
| Hob construction (bricks, mortar, cement) | Builder, carpenter, or bricklayer |
| Shower base / bed (sand-cement with falls) | Screeder, tiler, or builder |
| Pre-formed shower base/tray installation | Builder or plumber (depending on type) |
| Waterproofing the hob (membrane over all surfaces) | Waterproofer |

### Interface / Handoff Point

The builder/carpenter must complete ALL of the following before the waterproofer attends:

- Hob constructed and mortar fully cured (minimum 7 days)
- Hob secured to floor and sealed against walls (no gaps or loose joints)
- All gaps, joints, and intersections of the hob substrate made flush
- Shower recess floor prepared (either screeded or ready for screed)
- Hob height confirmed with tiler (to ensure correct finished levels)

The waterproofer then:

- Applies bond breaker to all hob-to-wall and hob-to-floor junctions
- Applies membrane continuously over the hob top, both faces (inside shower and outside), and down to the floor on both sides
- Extends the membrane from the hob into the shower floor and up the shower walls in a continuous waterproof envelope

### Common Disputes

- **Hob not built before waterproofer arrives:** The waterproofer turns up and there is no hob, or it is only partially built. The waterproofer cannot proceed, and a return visit (often charged at $150–$300 for call-out) is required.
- **Hob mortar not cured:** If the waterproofer applies membrane over green (uncured) mortar, the membrane can fail as the mortar shrinks during curing.
- **Hob height wrong:** If the hob is too low, water can escape the shower recess. If too high, it creates an accessibility issue. The builder must confirm height with the tiler and waterproofer before construction.
- **Hobless (walk-in) shower:** Increasingly popular in modern renovations. Eliminates the hob but requires precise fall management and a continuous membrane from the shower area into the broader bathroom floor. This is more complex and may increase the waterproofing scope (and cost).

### What to Look for in a Quote

- The waterproofing quote should state: "Hob and shower base construction excluded. Hob to be constructed by builder/carpenter and fully cured prior to waterproofing."
- If the project is a hobless/walk-in shower, the quote should explicitly address how the waterproofer will handle the threshold and transition to the general bathroom floor.

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.6 Substrate Repair

### What It Is

Substrate repair refers to fixing or replacing the underlying surface to which the waterproofing membrane will be applied. In a bathroom, the substrate is typically:

- **Floors:** Concrete slab, compressed fibre cement (CFC) sheet, or timber framing with CFC overlay
- **Walls:** Villaboard (fibre cement lining by James Hardie), wet-area-rated plasterboard, or existing tiles
- **Shower recesses:** Villaboard or CFC sheet on timber or steel framing

Substrate must be structurally sound, stable, dry, clean, and free of loose material, de-bonded coatings, curing agents, oil, grease, and sharp protrusions before the waterproofer can apply a membrane.

### Why It Is Typically Excluded

Substrate repair is building/carpentry work, not waterproofing work:

1. **Different trade and skill set:** Replacing damaged cement sheet, patching cracked concrete, or repairing rotted timber framing is a builder, carpenter, or concreter's scope.
2. **Underlying cause must be addressed:** If the substrate is damaged (e.g., water-damaged Villaboard from a previous waterproofing failure), simply patching it and waterproofing over it may mask the underlying problem.
3. **Extent unknown until demolition:** The full extent of substrate damage is often not visible until existing tiles and old waterproofing are removed. This makes it difficult to include in a fixed-price waterproofing quote.

### Which Trade Is Responsible

| Substrate Issue | Responsible Trade |
|---|---|
| Cracked or damaged concrete slab | Concreter or builder |
| Rotten or water-damaged timber framing | Carpenter or builder |
| Damaged Villaboard or fibre cement sheet | Carpenter or builder (replace sheet) |
| Swollen or delaminated wet-area plasterboard | Carpenter or builder (replace sheet) |
| Minor surface preparation (cleaning, light sanding, priming) | Waterproofer (this IS typically included) |

### Interface / Handoff Point

- The builder/carpenter completes all substrate repair and replacement
- The surface is left clean, dry, and structurally sound
- The waterproofer inspects the surface, performs minor preparation (priming, filling small imperfections), and applies the membrane
- If the waterproofer finds substrate damage that was not visible or reported, they should stop work, notify the homeowner/project manager, and request the appropriate trade to rectify before proceeding

### Common Disputes

- **Hidden damage discovered during waterproofing:** The waterproofer arrives, preps the surface, and finds soft, crumbling, or water-damaged substrate that cannot be waterproofed. This triggers a variation (additional cost) for builder repair and a delay. The homeowner often blames the waterproofer for the delay.
- **Waterproofer membranes over a bad substrate:** If the waterproofer applies membrane over a structurally unsound substrate, the membrane may crack or delaminate. The waterproofer may argue the substrate was not their responsibility; the homeowner may argue the waterproofer should not have proceeded.
- **"Minor prep" vs "major repair":** There is a grey area between minor surface preparation (included in most waterproofing quotes) and major substrate repair (excluded). Grinding off old adhesive residue or filling a few small holes is typically included. Replacing a full sheet of Villaboard or repairing a concrete crack is not.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- Does the quote state: "Assumes substrate is structurally sound and in suitable condition for membrane application"?
- Does it define what counts as "minor surface preparation" (included) vs "substrate repair" (excluded)?
- Is there a variation clause for unexpected substrate damage discovered during the work?

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.7 Asbestos Removal

### What It Is

Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) were widely used in Australian residential construction from the 1940s to the mid-1980s. In bathrooms and wet areas, asbestos is most commonly found in:

- **Fibro cement sheet (flat sheet)** — wall and ceiling linings
- **Tilux sheeting** — patterned, coloured waterproof panels used in wet areas (kitchens, bathrooms, laundries)
- **Vinyl floor tiles** — particularly the 9" x 9" tiles popular in the 1960s–70s
- **Adhesives** — some tile adhesives and sheet adhesives contained asbestos

Under Australian regulation (state and federal), **all fibro/cement sheet manufactured before late 1987 is assumed to contain asbestos unless tested and proven otherwise.** From 1 November 2015 (NSW EPA), all fibro is classified as asbestos until proven otherwise.

### Why It Is Excluded

Asbestos removal is a specialist activity with strict legal requirements:

1. **Separate licence required:** Asbestos removal requires a Class A (friable) or Class B (non-friable/bonded) asbestos removal licence, depending on the material type. This is a completely different licence from waterproofing.
2. **Strict safety protocols:** WHS regulations (nationally harmonised) require specific containment, PPE, air monitoring, disposal, and clearance procedures.
3. **Must be done first:** All asbestos removal must be completed before any other trade work begins. The waterproofer cannot attend a site with identified or suspected ACMs still in place.
4. **Disposal costs:** Asbestos waste must be disposed of at a licensed facility. Disposal costs are significant and separate from removal labour.

### Which Trade Is Responsible

Licensed asbestos removalist (Class A or Class B depending on the material). Not the waterproofer, plumber, tiler, or builder (unless they hold the relevant asbestos removal licence).

### Interface / Handoff Point

| Step | Trade | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Identify suspected ACMs | Homeowner, builder, or asbestos assessor | Pre-demolition inspection recommended for any home built before 1990 |
| 2. Test (if needed) | NATA-accredited laboratory | Sample collection by assessor or licensed removalist |
| 3. Remove ACMs | Licensed asbestos removalist | Includes containment, removal, transport, and disposal |
| 4. Clearance inspection | Independent assessor (for friable removal) | Written clearance certificate issued |
| 5. New substrate installation | Builder/carpenter | Replace removed fibro with compliant materials (e.g., Villaboard) |
| 6. Waterproofing | Waterproofer | On new, asbestos-free substrate |

### Common Disputes

- **Asbestos discovered mid-renovation:** The most disruptive scenario. Demolition begins, old wall or floor linings are found to contain asbestos, and all work stops. The homeowner faces unexpected asbestos removal costs ($1,500–$5,000+ for a bathroom, depending on extent) plus delays for removal and new substrate installation.
- **Builder removes fibro without testing:** Illegal and dangerous. If a non-licensed person removes suspected ACMs, they face WHS prosecution. The waterproofer should refuse to attend a site where unlicensed asbestos removal has occurred.
- **Homeowner did not budget for asbestos:** Very common in homes built before 1990. The waterproofing quote should include a note directing the homeowner to get an asbestos assessment before work begins.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- The waterproofing quote should state: "Asbestos identification, testing, removal, and disposal excluded. Any asbestos-containing material must be removed by a licensed asbestos removalist before waterproofing can commence."
- If the home was built before 1990, the waterproofer (or project manager) should recommend a pre-demolition asbestos inspection.

### Typical Asbestos Removal Costs (2025–2026 AUD)

| Scope | Cost Range |
|---|---|
| Small bathroom (fibro wall linings, < 10m2) | $1,500–$3,500 |
| Standard bathroom (walls + floor, 10–20m2) | $3,000–$6,000 |
| Disposal fees (per tonne to licensed facility) | $200–$400 |
| Asbestos testing (per sample) | $30–$80 |

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.8 Council and Certification Fees

### What It Is

Waterproofing in Australian residential renovations triggers several compliance and certification requirements:

1. **Waterproofing compliance certificate:** Issued by the licensed waterproofer to confirm the work complies with AS 3740:2021. This is the waterproofer's direct responsibility and is typically included in their quote.

2. **Building certifier / private certifier inspection:** In many jurisdictions, a building certifier (either council or private) must inspect the waterproofing before tiling proceeds. This is an independent verification that the membrane system is correctly installed.

3. **Council DA or CDC fees:** If the bathroom renovation involves structural changes (moving walls, changing room use, altering plumbing layout), a Development Application (DA) or Complying Development Certificate (CDC) may be required. The associated council fees are separate from the waterproofing scope.

4. **Flood testing fee:** Some certifiers require a flood (ponding) test to verify the membrane is watertight. This is typically arranged by the waterproofer but the certifier's inspection fee is separate.

### Why Some Fees Are Excluded

| Fee Type | Typically Included in Waterproofing Quote? | Who Pays? |
|---|---|---|
| Waterproofing compliance certificate | **YES** — this is the waterproofer's core deliverable | Waterproofer includes in quote |
| Flood/ponding test (performing the test) | **YES** — if required, the waterproofer conducts it | Waterproofer includes in quote |
| Building certifier inspection fee | **NO** — this is an independent third-party fee | Homeowner pays directly (or via builder) |
| Council DA/CDC fees | **NO** — these are regulatory fees for the overall project | Homeowner pays directly |
| Private certifier engagement fee | **NO** — the homeowner or builder engages the certifier | Homeowner pays directly (or via builder) |

### Typical Certification and Inspection Costs (2025–2026 AUD)

| Item | Cost Range |
|---|---|
| Waterproofing compliance certificate (from waterproofer) | Included in waterproofing quote (no separate charge) |
| Building certifier waterproofing inspection (private) | $200–$450 |
| Council DA fees (if applicable) | $200–$2,000+ depending on scope |
| CDC fees (if applicable) | $500–$1,500 |

### Common Disputes

- **Homeowner assumes the waterproofer arranges the certifier inspection:** The waterproofer issues their own compliance certificate, but the building certifier inspection is a separate requirement that must be arranged by the homeowner or builder. If no certifier inspection is booked, the tiler may proceed without independent sign-off — creating a compliance gap.
- **Certifier fails the waterproofing:** If the certifier identifies defects, the waterproofer is responsible for rectification at no additional cost to the homeowner (this is a warranty/workmanship issue). However, the re-inspection fee charged by the certifier is typically borne by the homeowner or negotiated with the waterproofer.
- **Council approval delays:** If the renovation requires a DA and it has not been approved, no trade work (including waterproofing) should commence. Delays in council approval are not the waterproofer's responsibility.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- Does the quote include the waterproofing compliance certificate? (It should.)
- Does the quote include photographic documentation of membrane application? (Increasingly required by certifiers and good practice.)
- Does the quote note that building certifier inspection fees are excluded and are the homeowner's responsibility?

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.9 Wall Board Installation

### What It Is

Wall board installation refers to fixing new Villaboard (James Hardie fibre cement lining), wet-area-rated plasterboard, or compressed fibre cement (CFC) sheet to wall and ceiling framing in wet areas. This creates the substrate to which the waterproofing membrane will be applied.

In a renovation context, wall board installation is needed when:
- Old wall linings have been removed during demolition (e.g., fibro containing asbestos, or water-damaged plasterboard)
- The room is being reconfigured and new walls are being built
- Existing linings are not suitable for waterproofing (e.g., standard plasterboard in a shower recess)

### Why It Is Excluded

Wall board installation is a builder/carpenter trade scope:

1. **Framing and fixing:** Lining sheets must be fixed to wall and ceiling framing using specific screw patterns and fixings. This is carpentry work.
2. **Material selection:** The builder/carpenter (in consultation with the waterproofer) selects the appropriate lining material. AS 3740:2021 requires that substrate materials in wet areas be "suitable for the intended purpose" — meaning moisture-resistant at minimum. Villaboard is the industry standard for shower recesses and high-moisture areas.
3. **Joint treatment:** Joints between sheets must be taped and/or filled before waterproofing. The builder/carpenter handles this.
4. **Must be complete before waterproofing:** All wall linings must be installed, fixed, and joints treated before the waterproofer attends.

### Material Requirements (AS 3740:2021)

| Location | Minimum Substrate Requirement |
|---|---|
| Shower recess walls (above and below membrane line) | Fibre cement sheet (e.g., Villaboard) or equivalent moisture-resistant lining |
| Bathroom walls outside shower (0–150mm above floor) | Fibre cement sheet or moisture-resistant plasterboard |
| Bathroom walls outside shower (above 150mm) | Standard plasterboard acceptable (not in direct water contact) |
| Bathroom ceiling | Standard plasterboard acceptable (unless directly above an open shower) |
| Floors | Compressed fibre cement sheet or concrete slab |

### Which Trade Is Responsible

| Task | Responsible Trade |
|---|---|
| Supply wall lining material | Builder/carpenter (or homeowner, if owner-managed) |
| Fix wall lining to framing | Builder/carpenter |
| Joint treatment (tape, fill, sand) | Builder/carpenter or plasterer |
| Priming substrate for membrane adhesion | Waterproofer (this IS included) |
| Applying waterproofing membrane to lined walls | Waterproofer |

### Interface / Handoff Point

The builder/carpenter must complete all of the following before the waterproofer attends:

- All wall and ceiling linings installed and fully fixed
- All sheet joints taped and filled (no gaps, open joints, or protruding screws)
- All penetrations (pipes, electrical conduits) cut and linings fitted around them
- Linings plumb, flat, and free of damage
- Framing behind linings is structurally sound and free of moisture

### Common Disputes

- **Wrong material used:** Builder installs standard plasterboard in a shower recess instead of Villaboard. The waterproofer should refuse to membrane over non-compliant substrate. Rectification is the builder's cost.
- **Joints not treated:** Untreated sheet joints create weak points in the membrane. The waterproofer may refuse to proceed until joints are properly treated.
- **Linings not installed before waterproofer arrives:** Incomplete wall linings mean the waterproofer cannot complete their scope. A return visit fee applies.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- The waterproofing quote should state: "Wall and ceiling lining installation excluded. All wall linings to be installed by builder/carpenter on moisture-resistant substrate (Villaboard or equivalent in shower recesses) prior to waterproofing."
- If the homeowner is managing trades directly (not using a builder), they must coordinate the wall lining installation to be complete before the waterproofer's scheduled date.

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.10 Electrical Work

### What It Is

Electrical work in the context of a bathroom renovation includes:

- **Electrical rough-in:** Running cables for lights, exhaust fans, power points, heated towel rails, in-floor heating, and switches — all concealed within walls and floors before linings are installed.
- **In-floor (underfloor) heating:** Electric heating mats or cables installed in the floor, typically under tiles, for heated bathroom floors. The electrical connection and thermostat installation is the electrician's scope.
- **Exhaust fan ducting:** The exhaust fan unit and its ducting to the exterior must be installed during rough-in.
- **Downlights:** Recessed ceiling lights must be wired and positioned during rough-in.

### Why It Is Excluded

All electrical work must be completed by a licensed electrician. It is excluded from the waterproofing scope because:

1. **Separate licence:** Electrical work requires an electrical contractor licence. A waterproofer cannot legally perform any electrical work.
2. **Must be done before waterproofing:** All electrical cables, conduits, and junction boxes that pass through or sit within waterproofed areas must be installed before the membrane is applied. If the electrician runs cables after waterproofing, they will puncture the membrane.
3. **In-floor heating has a specific sequence with waterproofing:** This is the most complex electrical-waterproofing interface.

### In-Floor Heating — Critical Sequence Detail

In-floor heating systems interact with the waterproofing membrane in one of two ways:

| System Type | Sequence | Membrane Placement |
|---|---|---|
| **In-screed system** (heating cable embedded in sand-cement screed) | Membrane applied → Heating cable laid on mesh over membrane → Screed applied over cable | Membrane is UNDER the heating cable and screed |
| **Under-tile system** (heating mat laid directly on surface) | Screed with falls → Waterproofing membrane applied → Heating mat laid on top of membrane → Tiles laid directly over mat | Membrane is UNDER the heating mat; mat sits between membrane and tiles |

In both cases:
- The electrician must run the mains power cable to the thermostat location and install conduits (typically 2 x 20mm) from the thermostat position to the floor, before the waterproofer attends.
- The heating cable/mat is installed AFTER waterproofing in all methods. The heating element sits on top of the membrane.
- The thermostat floor sensor must be embedded in the floor — the electrician installs this after waterproofing but before tiling.

### Which Trade Is Responsible

| Task | Responsible Trade |
|---|---|
| All electrical rough-in (cables, conduits, junction boxes) | Licensed electrician |
| Mains power to thermostat location + conduits to floor | Licensed electrician |
| Waterproofing membrane application | Licensed waterproofer |
| Installing in-floor heating mat/cable ON TOP of membrane | Electrician or tiler (varies — confirm in quote) |
| Floor sensor installation | Electrician |
| Thermostat installation and connection | Licensed electrician |
| Final electrical fit-off (lights, fans, power points, towel rails) | Licensed electrician |

### Interface / Handoff Point

The electrician must complete all rough-in work (cables, conduits, junction boxes, exhaust fan positioning) before the waterproofer attends. Specifically:

- All cables in walls and ceilings must be run and secured
- Conduits for in-floor heating thermostat must be installed and terminated at the floor
- No electrical cables or conduits should be running across the floor surface in the path of the waterproofing membrane (they should be embedded in or under the substrate)
- The electrician does NOT install the heating mat/cable until AFTER waterproofing is complete

### Common Disputes

- **Electrician arrives after waterproofing:** If the electrician needs to run a cable through a waterproofed wall or floor, the membrane is compromised. Re-waterproofing is required at the electrician's (or project manager's) cost.
- **In-floor heating mat damages membrane:** If the tiler or electrician drops or drags the heating mat roughly, it can scratch or puncture the membrane. Careful handling is essential.
- **Homeowner adds a heated towel rail after waterproofing:** If the mounting points for a heated towel rail penetrate the waterproofed wall zone (below 1800mm in a shower area), the membrane is compromised. Mounting points should be planned during rough-in.

### What to Look for in a Quote

- The waterproofing quote should state: "All electrical rough-in, including in-floor heating conduits, to be completed by licensed electrician prior to waterproofing. Waterproofer accepts no responsibility for electrical work or damage caused by electrical trades working after membrane application."
- If in-floor heating is planned, the quote should specify whether the waterproofer's scope includes membrane application under the heating system and, if so, what coordination is required with the electrician.

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 4.11 What SHOULD Be Included in a Complete Waterproofing Quote

This section defines what homeowners should expect to see in a complete, professional waterproofing quote. A quote that omits these items is either incomplete or deliberately cheap — and the homeowner will pay for the missing items through variations or, worse, through future leak repairs.

### Core Inclusions — Non-Negotiable Items

Every professional waterproofing quote for a bathroom renovation should include all of the following:

| Item | Description | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Surface preparation** | Cleaning, priming, and minor filling of the substrate to achieve a suitable surface for membrane adhesion | A membrane applied to a dusty, contaminated, or friable surface will delaminate. Two coats of porous primer are standard. |
| **Bond breaker application** | Neutral cure silicone or bond breaker tape applied to all internal corners, wall-floor junctions, hob-wall junctions, and junctions where movement may occur | Required by AS 3740:2021 for all bonded membranes. Allows the membrane to accommodate building movement without tearing. |
| **Reinforcing tape / poly cloth** | Fabric reinforcing tape embedded in the membrane at all junctions, corners, and penetrations | Strengthens the membrane at its most vulnerable points — corners and junctions — preventing cracks and tears. |
| **Primer coat** | Application of the waterproofing system's specified primer to all surfaces | Ensures membrane adhesion. Two coats on porous surfaces. Must be compatible with the membrane system. |
| **Membrane application — floors** | Full waterproofing membrane applied to the entire shower floor and, depending on floor type and storey, the entire bathroom floor | AS 3740:2021 requires full waterproofing of: all shower floors; ground-floor bathroom floors (water-resistant minimum); upper-storey bathroom floors and timber-framed floors (full waterproof membrane). |
| **Membrane application — walls** | Full waterproofing membrane applied to shower walls to a minimum height of 1800mm above finished floor level (or 50mm above the shower rose, whichever is higher) | AS 3740:2021 minimum requirement. Many professional waterproofers go higher for safety. |
| **Membrane application — hobs** | Full waterproofing membrane over the top and both faces of any shower hob, extending continuously into the floor and wall membranes | The hob is an integral part of the waterproof envelope. A gap or discontinuity here is a guaranteed leak point. |
| **Penetration sealing** | Membrane application around all pipe penetrations (waste pipes, water supply, floor wastes, puddle flanges) | Every penetration is a potential failure point. The membrane must form a continuous, sealed envelope around each penetration. |
| **Membrane to puddle flanges** | Application of membrane over and into all puddle flanges at floor waste locations | The flange-to-membrane junction is the most common point of failure in bathroom waterproofing. |
| **Flood/ponding test** (if required) | Filling the waterproofed area with water to a set depth for a specified duration (typically 24 hours) to verify membrane integrity | Not universally required by all certifiers but is best practice and required in some jurisdictions. The waterproofer performs the test; the certifier inspects the results. |
| **Waterproofing compliance certificate** | Written certificate confirming the work complies with AS 3740:2021, including the membrane system used, number of coats, and coverage area | Legal requirement in most states. Required by certifiers, councils, and insurance companies. Without it, tiling should not proceed. |
| **Photographic documentation** | Dated photos of the membrane at all stages — primer, first coat, reinforcing, second coat, penetrations, junctions, and completed work | Increasingly required by certifiers and good practice for warranty claims. Once tiles are laid, the membrane is hidden forever. Photos are the only evidence. |
| **Material supply** | All waterproofing materials — primer, membrane, bond breaker, reinforcing tape, silicone, and associated consumables | These are the waterproofer's materials. The homeowner should not be expected to supply waterproofing products. |
| **Clean-up** | Removal of waste materials and leaving the site clean for the next trade (tiler) | Standard trade practice. The waterproofer should not leave membrane offcuts, empty tins, or contaminated materials on site. |

### Items That Should Be Included but Are Sometimes Missed

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Return visit for second coat** | Some membrane systems require coats applied on different days. The quote should include the return visit. |
| **Minimum film thickness verification** | AS 3740:2021 requires documented membrane thickness readings. The quote should confirm this is included. |
| **Curing time / scheduling** | The quote should specify how long the membrane needs to cure before tiling can commence (typically 24–72 hours). |
| **Warranty** | The waterproofer should provide a written warranty on workmanship. Industry standard is 7–10 years for residential waterproofing. Material warranties (from the membrane manufacturer) are separate and typically longer (10–25 years). |
