# SECTION 5: PRICING GUIDANCE (FOR PC SUMS ONLY)

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER FOR AI SYSTEM:** These prices are indicative ballpark ranges only, sourced from publicly available Australian cost guides and waterproofing company websites (2024-2026). They are intended to help the AI flag approximate budget ranges to homeowners (e.g., "budget approximately $X-$Y for this item"). They are NOT quotes. Actual costs vary significantly by location, access, existing conditions, substrate type, floor construction (slab vs timber), number of penetrations, and individual waterproofer pricing. The AI should always recommend obtaining 2-3 quotes from licensed waterproofers.

## 1. Per Square Metre Rates by Membrane Type

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (rates vary by product brand, application method, and region)

These are **supply and install** rates for new waterproofing on prepared substrates.

| Membrane Type | Rate (per m2) | Typical Use | Lifespan |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Acrylic liquid membrane** (standard) | $45 - $70 | Bathrooms, laundries, standard wet areas | 10-15 years |
| **Polyurethane liquid membrane** | $55 - $80 | Bathrooms, balconies, higher-performance areas | 15-25 years |
| **Cementitious coating** | $35 - $60 | Below-grade, retaining walls, planter boxes | 10-15 years |
| **Sheet membrane (PVC/TPO)** | $60 - $90 | Large floor areas, under-tile, commercial | 15-25+ years |
| **Bitumen torch-on membrane** | $70 - $100 | Balconies, rooftops, podiums | 15-25+ years |
| **Epoxy coating** | $50 - $85 | Industrial, high-chemical-exposure areas | 15-20 years |

**Key notes:**
- The most common system for residential bathrooms is **acrylic liquid membrane** (e.g., Ardex WPM 300, Davco K10, Bostik Dampfix) -- this is the "standard" system most waterproofers quote against
- Polyurethane membranes (e.g., Ardex WPM 155, Just Waterproofing Multithane) are considered premium for residential and are standard for balconies and external areas
- Sheet membranes add labour time for cutting and fitting around penetrations, which is why the per-sqm rate is higher despite potentially cheaper raw material
- Supply-only membrane material costs approximately $15-$30 per sqm for liquid membranes; the remainder is labour, primer, tape, and overheads
- Most residential bathroom waterproofing uses 2-coat liquid membrane application with reinforcing tape at all junctions

## 2. Standard Bathroom Waterproofing (Complete)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

Complete bathroom waterproofing includes: floor membrane, shower wall membrane (to ceiling height), wall/floor junctions sealed with bond breaker tape, all penetrations sealed with puddle flanges, and a waterproofing certificate.

### 2.1 By Bathroom Size

| Bathroom Size | Floor Area | Typical Cost Range | Effective Rate (per m2) | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Small** (ensuite/powder room) | 3 - 5 m2 | $500 - $900 | $100 - $180 | Minimum charges often apply; effective rate higher |
| **Medium** (standard family) | 5 - 8 m2 | $800 - $1,500 | $100 - $190 | Most common residential size |
| **Large** (master ensuite) | 8 - 12 m2 | $1,200 - $2,500 | $100 - $210 | Walk-in shower + freestanding bath increases wall area |
| **Very large / luxury** | 12+ m2 | $2,000 - $3,500+ | $120 - $220 | Multiple wet zones, complex layouts |

**Why the effective rate is higher than the per-sqm membrane rate:**
- The "per sqm" rates in Section 1 cover membrane application to the floor area only
- Complete bathroom waterproofing includes: shower walls (often 6-10 sqm of vertical surface), bond breaker tape at every junction, puddle flanges at every penetration, primer on all surfaces, and the waterproofing certificate
- The total waterproofed area (floor + walls) is typically 2-3x the floor area
- Minimum charges apply for small bathrooms -- a waterproofer won't come out for less than approximately $500

### 2.2 What Is Typically Included in a Complete Bathroom Quote

| Item | Included? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Surface preparation / cleaning | Yes | Light prep; heavy grinding or patching may be extra |
| Primer application | Yes | Applied to all surfaces before membrane |
| Bond breaker tape at all junctions | Yes | Wall/floor, wall/wall, and around penetrations |
| Puddle flanges (supply and install) | Usually | 2-4 penetrations standard; extra flanges may be additional |
| Liquid membrane (2 coats minimum) | Yes | Floor + shower walls to ceiling |
| Shower walls to ceiling | Yes | AS 3740 requirement for enclosed showers |
| Non-shower walls to 150mm above floor | Yes | AS 3740 minimum requirement |
| Waterproofing certificate | Yes | Required by building regulations |
| Flood testing (if applicable) | Sometimes | Some include, some charge extra |

---

## 3. Shower Only Waterproofing

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (less commonly priced as standalone; often bundled with full bathroom)

Shower-only waterproofing covers the shower floor area plus all shower walls to ceiling height. This applies when only the shower recess is being renovated, not the entire bathroom.

| Shower Type | Typical Cost Range | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Walk-in shower** (hobless, 1.0 - 2.0 m2 floor) | $600 - $1,200 | Requires careful detailing at threshold; falls critical |
| **Walk-in shower** (with hob, 1.0 - 2.0 m2 floor) | $500 - $1,000 | Hob provides secondary containment |
| **Shower over bath** | $400 - $800 | Walls only (bath acts as floor containment) |
| **Large walk-in / wheelchair accessible** (2.0 - 3.5 m2) | $800 - $1,500 | Larger floor + more wall area; linear drain detailing |

**Key notes:**
- Walk-in (hobless) showers require the entire bathroom floor to be waterproofed under AS 3740, not just the shower area -- so a "shower only" quote for a hobless shower effectively becomes a full bathroom waterproof
- Shower walls must be waterproofed to a minimum of 1800mm above the floor, or to ceiling if the shower is enclosed (AS 3740)
- Shower-over-bath waterproofing is the most cost-effective as the bath itself provides floor containment
- Niche recesses in shower walls add complexity and cost ($50-$100 per niche for additional membrane detailing)

## 4. Laundry Waterproofing

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (limited standalone pricing data; often bundled with bathroom)

| Laundry Configuration | Floor Area | Typical Cost Range | Notes |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Laundry floor only** (trough + washing machine area) | 4 - 6 m2 | $350 - $700 | Floor membrane + 150mm up walls |
| **Full laundry floor** (larger room) | 6 - 10 m2 | $500 - $1,000 | Floor membrane + 150mm up walls |
| **Combined laundry/bathroom** (with shower) | 6 - 10 m2 | $800 - $1,800 | Full wet area treatment; shower walls to ceiling |
| **Laundry with floor waste only** | 4 - 6 m2 | $300 - $600 | Minimum waterproofing to comply with AS 3740 |

**Key notes:**
- Under AS 3740, laundries require waterproofing if they contain a floor waste -- the floor must be waterproofed to 150mm up all walls
- If the laundry has no floor waste but contains a washing machine, waterproofing is recommended but may not be mandatory in all jurisdictions (check local requirements)
- Combined laundry/bathroom is priced similarly to a standard bathroom as it requires full wet area treatment
- Laundry trough penetrations and washing machine tap connections require puddle flanges or sealed penetrations

## 5. Balcony Waterproofing

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (prices vary widely based on system type and access)

Balconies require different (typically more robust) membrane systems than interior wet areas due to UV exposure, thermal movement, and direct weather exposure.

| Balcony Size | Typical Cost Range | Effective Rate (per m2) | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Small** (2 - 5 m2) | $500 - $1,000 | $100 - $200 | Minimum charges apply |
| **Medium** (5 - 15 m2) | $700 - $1,500 | $70 - $150 | Standard residential balcony |
| **Large** (15 - 30 m2) | $1,200 - $3,000 | $60 - $100 | Economies of scale improve rate |
| **Very large / podium** (30+ m2) | $2,500 - $5,000+ | $50 - $90 | Commercial-grade systems typical |

### 5.1 Balcony Per Square Metre Rates by System

| System | Rate (per m2) | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Polyurethane liquid membrane** | $55 - $100 | Most common for residential balconies |
| **Bitumen torch-on** | $70 - $120 | Heavy-duty; requires gas torch application |
| **Sheet membrane (TPO/PVC)** | $80 - $130 | Welded seams; excellent long-term performance |
| **PMMA/PUMA rapid-cure** | $100 - $160 | Fast cure; premium; common in commercial |

**Key notes:**
- Balcony waterproofing almost always requires a **minimum charge** of $500-$800 regardless of size
- Over habitable spaces (e.g., balcony above a bedroom), expect a 20-40% premium due to stricter requirements and consequence of failure
- Existing tile removal and screed repair are NOT typically included in waterproofing quotes -- these are separate trades/costs
- Drainage details (scuppers, outlets, box gutters) add $100-$300 each depending on complexity
- Balcony waterproofing to external areas must comply with AS 4654.2 (not AS 3740)

## 6. Additional Items (Priced Separately)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-LOW (many of these are bundled into complete quotes; standalone pricing is indicative)

These items may appear as separate line items in some quotes, or may be bundled into the overall waterproofing price. When the AI generates scope items, these should be listed as inclusions with indicative costs.

### 6.1 Puddle Flanges / Penetration Sealing

| Item | Typical Cost (supply + install) | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Puddle flange -- floor waste** (80mm or 100mm) | $50 - $120 each | Supply ~$20-$40; install ~$30-$80 |
| **Puddle flange -- shower waste** | $50 - $120 each | Same as floor waste |
| **Pipe penetration seal** (hot/cold water, tap) | $30 - $80 each | Smaller penetrations, less material |
| **Toilet flange seal** | $50 - $100 each | Requires careful integration with membrane |
| **Additional penetration** (per penetration beyond standard) | $30 - $80 each | Standard quote assumes 2-4 penetrations |

**Note:** A typical bathroom has 3-5 penetrations (floor waste, shower waste, toilet, hot/cold pipes). Most complete bathroom waterproofing quotes include up to 4 puddle flanges. Additional penetrations above this may be charged separately.

### 6.2 Hob / Step-Down Construction

| Item | Typical Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Shower hob (mortar)** | $150 - $350 per linear metre | Formed from mortar/render; waterproofer or tiler may do this |
| **Shower hob (prefabricated)** | $80 - $200 per linear metre | Supply + install; easier but less flexible |
| **Step-down at door threshold** | $100 - $250 | Required where bathroom floor meets corridor |
| **Niche recess waterproofing** | $50 - $100 per niche | Additional membrane and detailing |

**Note:** Hob construction is sometimes done by the waterproofer, sometimes by the tiler or builder. Clarify in the scope who is responsible.

### 6.3 Bond Breaker and Reinforcement Tape

| Item | Typical Cost (supply + install) | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Bond breaker / reinforcement tape** (per linear metre) | $5 - $15 /lm installed | Applied at all wall/floor junctions, internal corners, and around penetrations |
| **Typical bathroom total** (tape only) | $80 - $200 | Approximately 10-20 linear metres depending on room size |
| **Supply only -- tape** (per 10m roll) | $15 - $40 per roll | Crommelin, Bostik Dampfix Bandage, or similar |

**Note:** Bond breaker tape is almost always included in a complete waterproofing quote. It is rarely priced as a standalone item except in remedial or partial waterproofing scenarios.

### 6.4 Primer Application

| Item | Typical Cost (supply + install) | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Primer application** (per m2) | $5 - $12 /m2 | Applied to all surfaces before membrane |
| **Typical bathroom total** (primer only) | $50 - $150 | Depends on total surface area (floor + walls) |
| **Supply only -- primer** (per litre) | $15 - $35 /litre | Coverage approx 5-8 m2/litre depending on substrate porosity |

**Note:** Primer is standard practice and included in virtually all professional waterproofing quotes. It ensures membrane adhesion to the substrate.

### 6.5 Screed to Falls

| Item | Typical Cost (supply + install) | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Screed to falls -- shower floor** (per m2) | $40 - $80 /m2 | Sand/cement screed to achieve 1:60 to 1:80 fall to waste |
| **Screed to falls -- bathroom floor** (per m2) | $35 - $70 /m2 | Gentler falls to floor waste |
| **Screed to falls -- balcony** (per m2) | $45 - $90 /m2 | Must achieve falls to drainage point; often thicker |
| **Typical shower screed** (1.0 - 2.0 m2) | $80 - $200 | Small area but precision work |
| **Typical bathroom screed** (5 - 8 m2) | $250 - $600 | Includes shower and general floor |

**Note:** Screeding is often done by the waterproofer as part of a combined package, but it may also be done by a tiler or separate screeder. Clarify in the scope. Falls are critical -- incorrect falls are a leading cause of water pooling and long-term waterproofing failure.

## 7. Inspection and Certification Fees

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies by state, council, and whether bundled with waterproofing quote)

### 7.1 Waterproofing Certificate

In most Australian states, a waterproofing certificate is required before tiling can commence. This certificate confirms the membrane has been correctly applied and has passed inspection.

| Item | Typical Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Waterproofing certificate** (included in quote) | $0 (bundled) | Most licensed waterproofers include the certificate in their quote |
| **Waterproofing certificate** (standalone / third-party) | $150 - $350 | When an independent certifier inspects work done by another party |
| **Flood test** (water ponding test) | $100 - $250 | Fill area with water for 24 hours to check for leaks; some councils require this |

### 7.2 State-by-State Certification Requirements

| State/Territory | Certificate Required? | Key Notes |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **NSW** | Yes -- mandatory | Licensed waterproofer must issue certificate; required before tiling. Home Building Act 1989 applies. Only licensed waterproofers can perform work >$500. |
| **VIC** | Yes -- mandatory | Victorian Building Authority (VBA) requires compliance certificate. Registered Building Practitioner must sign off. |
| **QLD** | Yes -- recommended/required | QBCC licence required. Certificate of waterproofing compliance is standard practice; required for inspections. |
| **WA** | Yes -- required for building permit work | Building Commission WA requires compliance with BCA/NCC. Certificate issued by licensed applicator. |
| **SA** | Yes -- required | Must comply with BCA. Licensed waterproofer issues certificate. Council may require inspection before tiling. |
| **TAS** | Yes -- required for building permit work | Smaller market; fewer specialists. Certificate required for permit compliance. |
| **ACT** | Yes -- required | Must comply with BCA. Certificate required before next trade (tiling) can commence. |
| **NT** | Yes -- required for building permit work | Must comply with BCA. Certificate required; smaller market with fewer specialists. |

**Key notes:**
- In ALL states, waterproofing in wet areas must comply with AS 3740 (Waterproofing of domestic wet areas) and the National Construction Code (NCC/BCA)
- The certificate is typically provided by the waterproofer who did the work, not a separate inspector
- Some councils conduct their own inspections at the waterproofing stage (before tiling), particularly for owner-builder permits
- A missing waterproofing certificate can cause significant problems at point of sale -- insurers and conveyancers increasingly require evidence of compliant waterproofing

## 8. City-by-City Pricing Guide

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (limited direct city comparisons available; interpolated from regional data)

### 8.1 Per Square Metre Rates (Liquid Membrane, Supply and Install)

| City | Standard Rate (per m2) | Premium Rate (per m2) | Notes |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $50 - $80 | $70 - $120 | Highest in Australia; strict NSW licensing; high demand |
| **Melbourne** | $45 - $70 | $65 - $100 | Strong competition keeps prices slightly below Sydney |
| **Brisbane** | $45 - $65 | $60 - $90 | Slightly lower labour costs; subtropical climate increases demand |
| **Perth** | $45 - $70 | $60 - $100 | Cyclical with mining/construction demand |
| **Adelaide** | $40 - $60 | $55 - $85 | Generally lower labour costs |
| **Hobart** | $45 - $65 | $60 - $90 | Smaller market; fewer specialists; travel costs higher |
| **Canberra** | $40 - $60 | $55 - $85 | Government town; steady but smaller renovation market |
| **Darwin** | $50 - $70 | $65 - $100 | Tropical climate increases demand; smaller trade pool |

### 8.2 Complete Bathroom Waterproofing by City (Medium Bathroom, 5-8 m2)

| City | Low | Mid | High | Notes |
|------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $900 | $1,300 | $2,200 | Premium for upper-level apartments |
| **Melbourne** | $800 | $1,200 | $2,000 | Competitive market |
| **Brisbane** | $750 | $1,100 | $1,800 | Subtropical; high demand for waterproofing |
| **Perth** | $800 | $1,200 | $1,900 | Variable with construction cycles |
| **Adelaide** | $700 | $1,000 | $1,600 | Generally lower cost market |
| **Hobart** | $750 | $1,100 | $1,700 | Smaller market |
| **Canberra** | $700 | $1,000 | $1,600 | Similar to Adelaide pricing |
| **Darwin** | $800 | $1,200 | $1,900 | Tropical premium; limited trades |

**Key notes:**
- Sydney commands the highest rates nationally (15-25% above national average) due to cost of living, strict NSW licensing, traffic (longer travel), and high renovation demand
- Melbourne is typically 5-10% below Sydney but above other capitals
- Brisbane and Perth sit in the middle tier; both are influenced by construction boom/bust cycles
- Adelaide, Hobart, and Canberra are the most affordable capitals for waterproofing
- Darwin's rates are elevated by the small trade pool and tropical climate driving demand
- Regional areas outside capital cities typically attract a 10-20% premium due to travel costs and fewer available waterproofers

## 9. Pricing Factors and Cost Drivers

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent across all sources)

### 9.1 What Makes Waterproofing More Expensive?

| Factor | Impact | Typical Premium |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Upper-level bathroom** (over habitable space) | Entire floor must be waterproofed, not just shower area. Higher consequence of failure. | +20 - 40% |
| **Complex layout** (many penetrations, unusual shapes) | More cutting, detailing, and bond breaker tape required. | +15 - 30% |
| **Balcony / external area** | Different membrane system required (polyurethane or torch-on). UV and weather exposure. | +30 - 50% over standard bathroom rate |
| **Remedial waterproofing** (existing failure) | Requires demolition of existing tiles and screed, substrate repair, then re-waterproofing. | 2x - 4x new waterproofing cost |
| **Apartment / multi-storey access** | Difficult access, lift/stair carry, parking fees, strata requirements. | +10 - 20% |
| **Hobless / walk-in shower** | Entire bathroom floor must be waterproofed and fall correctly to waste. | +10 - 20% |
| **Substrate in poor condition** | Grinding, patching, or re-screeding required before membrane application. | +$200 - $600 depending on extent |
| **Multiple niches in shower walls** | Each niche requires careful waterproofing detailing. | +$50 - $100 per niche |
| **Linear drain (channel drain)** | More complex integration with membrane than point drain. | +$100 - $200 |
| **Premium membrane system** | Client or builder specifies polyurethane or sheet membrane over standard acrylic. | +20 - 40% |
| **After-hours or urgent work** | Weekend or evening work to meet renovation timelines. | +30 - 50% |

### 9.2 Supply vs Supply-and-Install Pricing

| Component | Supply Only | Supply and Install | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Liquid membrane** (per m2) | $10 - $25 | $45 - $80 | Labour is the major cost component |
| **Primer** (per m2) | $3 - $8 | $5 - $12 | Quick application; low material cost |
| **Bond breaker tape** (per lm) | $1.50 - $4 | $5 - $15 | Labour-intensive at corners and junctions |
| **Puddle flange** (each) | $20 - $45 | $50 - $120 | Supply cost is the puddle flange kit itself |

**Note:** DIY waterproofing is NOT recommended and is illegal in most states for work requiring a certificate. The supply-only prices are included for reference when understanding quote breakdowns, not to suggest DIY.

### 9.3 Urban vs Regional Price Differences

| Location Type | Adjustment | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| **Capital city CBD** | Base rate | Standard pricing applies |
| **Capital city suburbs** (inner/middle ring) | Base rate | Standard pricing applies |
| **Capital city outer suburbs** | +5 - 10% | Travel time premium |
| **Major regional city** (e.g., Newcastle, Geelong, Gold Coast) | +10 - 15% | Fewer specialists; travel included |
| **Regional town** (e.g., Bathurst, Bendigo, Bundaberg) | +15 - 25% | Significant travel; limited competition |
| **Remote area** | +25 - 50%+ | May need to bring waterproofer from nearest city; accommodation costs |

---

## 10. Remedial Waterproofing

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (costs are highly variable depending on extent of damage)

Remedial waterproofing involves fixing failed or leaking waterproofing. This is significantly more expensive than new waterproofing because it typically requires removal of tiles, screed, and the existing membrane before re-waterproofing.

| Scenario | Typical Cost Range | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Shower leak repair** (localised, minor) | $750 - $2,000 | May attempt injection or topical repair without full demolition |
| **Full bathroom strip and re-waterproof** | $3,000 - $8,000 | Tile removal + screed removal + re-screed + new membrane + re-tile |
| **Balcony waterproofing failure** | $5,000 - $25,000 | Surface rebuild; tile removal, new screed and falls, new membrane |
| **Water damage repair to structure below** | $5,000 - $30,000+ | Timber rot, plasterboard replacement, mould remediation |

**Key notes:**
- Remedial waterproofing is almost always a multi-trade job (demolition, waterproofing, tiling, potentially carpentry and plastering)
- The waterproofing component alone may only be $800-$1,500, but the total remediation cost (demolition + screed + waterproofing + tiling) is many times higher
- Failed waterproofing is the most common and costly building defect in Australian apartments
- Early detection and repair significantly reduces total remediation cost

## 11. How to Read a Waterproofing Quote

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on trade practice)

A professional waterproofing quote should include the following line items. When the AI generates scope-of-works, it should reference these categories:

| Quote Line Item | What It Covers | Red Flag If Missing |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Area to be waterproofed** | Exact rooms and surfaces (floor, walls, to what height) | Yes -- scope must be defined |
| **Membrane system** | Product name, type (liquid/sheet), and number of coats | Yes -- generic "waterproofing" is insufficient |
| **Surface preparation** | Grinding, patching, cleaning, priming | Moderate -- may be assumed but should be stated |
| **Bond breaker tape** | At all junctions, corners, and penetrations | Yes -- critical for membrane performance |
| **Puddle flanges** | Number and location of penetrations | Yes -- each penetration must be sealed |
| **Screed to falls** (if included) | Whether the waterproofer or another trade is responsible | Moderate -- must be clear who does this |
| **Hob construction** (if included) | Whether the waterproofer or another trade builds the hob | Moderate -- must be clear who does this |
| **Number of coats** | Minimum 2 coats for liquid membrane (AS 3740) | Yes -- single coat is non-compliant |
