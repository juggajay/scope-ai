## A. Bathroom Waterproofing

Bathroom waterproofing is the single most critical element of any wet-area renovation in Australia. A failure in the waterproofing membrane is the root cause of the vast majority of post-renovation building defects. In modern multi-unit residential buildings, between 20% and 40% of buildings have some form of waterproofing defect, and more than 80% of post-renovation leak complaints involve membrane failure.

**Key principle:** All waterproofing work in wet areas must be performed by a licensed waterproofing contractor in every Australian state and territory. A waterproofing compliance certificate must be issued and retained. The membrane must be inspected (and in some states, mandatorily inspected by a building surveyor/certifier) before it can be covered by tiles or any other finish. Tiling over an uninspected membrane is a compliance breach.

### A1. Substrate Preparation — Screed to Falls

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A sand-cement screed layer applied to the floor substrate (typically concrete slab) to create a graded fall toward the floor waste drain. The screed creates the slope that directs water to the drain point, preventing ponding. This is a critical step that occurs *before* the waterproofing membrane is applied (in the membrane-over-screed method, which is the dominant approach in most Australian states). |
| **What it involves** | Mixing and applying a sand-cement screed (typically 3:1 or 4:1 sand-to-cement ratio) to the bathroom floor substrate. The screed is laid to achieve the correct fall gradient toward the floor waste. For a shower recess, the screed forms the entire shower base, graded from the perimeter walls down to the central floor waste. For the general bathroom floor, the screed ensures water drains toward the floor waste rather than pooling against walls or near the door threshold. The screed must be allowed to cure sufficiently (typically 7-14 days depending on thickness and conditions) before the membrane is applied. |
| **Who does this** | This is a grey area in Australian construction. **In practice:** the screed is most commonly laid by the **tiler** (who specialises in floor bedding and screeding) or by a **builder/labourer**. The **waterproofer** does not typically lay the screed — their scope starts once the screed is cured and ready for priming and membrane application. However, the waterproofer has a vested interest in the screed quality because a poorly screeded substrate will compromise the membrane. In some cases, a dedicated **renderer** or **concretor** may do the screed work. **The scope-of-works should clarify which trade is responsible for the screed.** |
| **Fall requirements** | **Shower floor:** Minimum fall of 1:80 (12.5mm per metre) and maximum fall of 1:50 (20mm per metre) toward the floor waste, per AS 3740:2021. **General bathroom floor:** Where a floor waste is provided, the floor must be graded to drain toward it with falls between 1:60 and 1:80. The membrane placed below tiled finishes must also be graded — this is a specific requirement in AS 3740:2021 that the membrane itself must follow the fall, not just the tile surface above it. |
| **Membrane above or below screed** | Two methods exist in Australia: **(1) Membrane over screed (most common):** The screed is laid first to create falls, then the membrane is applied on top of the cured screed, then tiles are laid directly onto the membrane using tile adhesive. This is the dominant method in NSW, QLD, and VIC. **(2) Membrane under screed:** The membrane is applied directly to the structural substrate, then the screed is laid on top. Less common and used primarily in TAS and SA. AS 3740:2021 permits both methods. The membrane-over-screed method is preferred because the membrane is closer to the water source and protects the screed from water absorption. |
| **Typical specifications** | Sand-cement screed ratio 3:1 or 4:1. Minimum screed thickness varies by application — typically 20-40mm for bathroom floors. Screed must be smooth, free of cracks, and cured to a moisture content acceptable for the membrane manufacturer's requirements (typically below 75% relative humidity or as per product data sheet). No sharp edges, protrusions, or voids that could damage the membrane. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required for every bathroom with a floor waste (which is mandatory in the shower area). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 specifies minimum and maximum falls. NCC 2022 Part 10.2 references AS 3740 as the deemed-to-satisfy solution. The screed must provide a surface suitable for membrane application per the membrane manufacturer's instructions. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Incorrect fall — too flat causes ponding; too steep causes water to rush past the drain. (2) Not allowing the screed to cure before membrane application — excess moisture prevents proper membrane adhesion and curing. (3) Leaving sharp edges or rough surfaces that puncture the membrane during application. (4) Not coordinating between the screeder and the waterproofer — the waterproofer should inspect the screed before proceeding. (5) Forgetting that AS 3740:2021 requires the membrane itself to be graded (not just the tile surface). (6) Screed cracking due to insufficient curing time or no control joints. |

### A2. Substrate Preparation — Priming

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Application of a primer coat to the substrate before the waterproofing membrane is applied. The primer improves the bond between the substrate and the membrane, reduces porosity of the substrate (which can cause pinholes in the membrane), and consolidates surface dust. Different substrates require different primers. |
| **What it involves** | Cleaning the substrate of all dust, debris, loose material, and contaminants. Applying the primer by brush, roller, or spray as per manufacturer's instructions. Allowing the primer to dry before applying the membrane (typically 1-4 hours depending on product and conditions). The primer type must be compatible with both the substrate and the membrane system being used. |
| **Substrate-specific primer requirements** | **Concrete / sand-cement screed:** A water-based acrylic or cementitious primer. Reduces porosity and consolidates surface dust. Most membrane manufacturers supply a matching primer (e.g., Ardex WPM P, Gripset Primer, Sika Eco Prime WB). **Fibre cement sheet (e.g., Villaboard, Hardies):** Must be primed before membrane application. Use a product recommended by the membrane manufacturer — typically a water-based acrylic primer. Fibre cement is porous and will draw moisture out of the membrane too quickly without primer, causing poor adhesion. Products include Crommelin Waterproofing Surface Primer, Bostik Ultra Multiprime A530, Sika Eco Prime WB. **Plasterboard (moisture-resistant):** Requires priming to reduce porosity. Standard plasterboard should not be used in wet areas — only moisture-resistant (MR) plasterboard (green board) is acceptable. Prime with a compatible water-based primer. **Existing tiles (overlay):** If waterproofing over existing tiles (uncommon but sometimes done), the tiles must be thoroughly cleaned, deglossed, and primed with a bonding primer designed for non-porous surfaces. **Timber / plywood:** Requires a specialised primer that seals the timber and prevents tannin bleed. Not all membrane systems are suitable for timber substrates. |
| **Typical products** | Ardex WPM P (Primer), Gripset P09 Primer, Sika Eco Prime WB, Bostik Ultra Multiprime A530, Crommelin Waterproofing Surface Primer, Mapei Eco Prim Grip. Coverage rates vary — typically 5-10 m2 per litre depending on substrate porosity. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — priming is required by virtually all membrane manufacturers and is considered essential for a compliant application. Skipping primer is one of the leading causes of membrane failure in Australia. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires membrane installation in accordance with manufacturer's instructions — nearly all manufacturers mandate priming. AS/NZS 4858:2004 testing assumes the membrane is applied to a properly prepared substrate. Failure to prime can void the membrane warranty and constitute non-compliant work. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Skipping the primer entirely — one of the most common waterproofing failures in Australia. (2) Using the wrong primer for the substrate type (e.g., using a concrete primer on fibre cement). (3) Not allowing the primer to dry before applying the membrane. (4) Applying the primer too thickly (creates a film that acts as a debonding layer). (5) Not cleaning the substrate before priming — dust and debris trapped under the primer prevent proper adhesion. (6) Using a primer from a different manufacturer than the membrane without confirming compatibility — this can void both warranties. |

### A3. Bond Breaker Installation (Internal Corners and Junctions)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A bond breaker is a flexible strip (typically polyester fabric or specialised tape) installed in internal corners and junctions (where walls meet floors, or walls meet walls) *before* the waterproofing membrane is applied. Its purpose is to allow for differential movement between the two surfaces at the junction without tearing the membrane. Buildings move — thermal expansion, shrinkage, settling, and structural loading all cause slight movement at junctions. Without a bond breaker, the membrane is bonded rigidly to both surfaces at the corner and will crack when movement occurs. |
| **What it involves** | Cutting and pressing bond breaker tape into every internal corner and junction: floor/wall junctions, wall/wall junctions (internal corners), and around penetrations. The bond breaker is typically embedded in the first coat of membrane — a bead of membrane is applied into the corner, the bond breaker tape is pressed in, then the membrane is applied over the top. Some systems use a self-adhesive bond breaker tape applied directly to the substrate before the membrane. The bond breaker must sit smoothly in the corner without bridging (leaving an air gap behind the tape) or wrinkling. |
| **How it works** | The bond breaker prevents the membrane from bonding to the substrate in the corner zone. This means when the two surfaces move relative to each other, the membrane flexes across the unbonded zone rather than being rigidly held and torn. It creates a "hinge" in the membrane at the junction. The width of the bond breaker tape (typically 100-150mm total, split across both surfaces) determines how much movement the detail can accommodate. |
| **Typical products** | Gripset Elastoproof B10 / B50 Bond Breaker Joint Band, Bostik Dampfix Bandage, Crommelin Flexible Reinforcing Bond Breaking Tape, Ardex Butynol Tape, various butyl flashing tapes (80-150mm wide). The bond breaker tape may be woven polyester, non-woven polyester, or butyl rubber depending on the system. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required at all internal corners and junctions per AS 3740:2021. This is not optional and is a critical detail that is frequently omitted by less experienced waterproofers. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires that wall/floor junctions and wall/wall junctions within waterproofed areas be treated to accommodate movement. The bond breaker is the standard industry method for achieving this. AS/NZS 4858:2004 classifies membranes by elongation — the bond breaker detail works in conjunction with membrane elongation properties to handle movement. The bond breaker must be compatible with the membrane system being used. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Omitting bond breakers entirely — the single most common detail failure. (2) Bridging the corner — leaving an air gap behind the tape in the corner instead of pressing it firmly into the angle. (3) Wrinkles or folds in the tape — create channels for water to track behind the membrane. (4) Using incompatible bond breaker tape with the membrane system. (5) Not overlapping tape ends at intersections (e.g., where a wall/floor junction meets a wall/wall junction). (6) Applying the bond breaker after the membrane is partly cured — it must be embedded in wet membrane or applied before the first coat. |

### A4. Reinforcement Tape / Fabric (Internal Corners and Junctions)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Reinforcement tape (also called bandage, fabric, or scrim) is a woven or non-woven polyester fabric strip embedded in the waterproofing membrane at internal corners, junctions, and stress points. It reinforces the membrane at locations where cracking is most likely to occur. In many waterproofing systems, the reinforcement tape *is* the bond breaker — it serves both purposes simultaneously. Some systems use a separate bond breaker tape underneath with a reinforcement layer over the top. |
| **What it involves** | Applying a coat of liquid membrane to the junction area, embedding the reinforcement fabric/tape into the wet membrane, then applying a second coat of membrane over the top. The fabric must be fully encapsulated — no dry edges or exposed fabric. The tape is typically 100-150mm wide and is cut to length and pressed into each junction. At T-junctions (where three surfaces meet) and cross-junctions, the tape must be overlapped to provide continuous reinforcement. |
| **Where it is used** | All floor/wall junctions in the waterproofed area. All internal wall/wall corners. Around all penetrations (pipes, flanges). At the junction between the shower hob and the floor. At the junction between the shower hob and the walls. Around door threshold/hob junctions. At any control joint or crack in the substrate. |
| **Typical products** | Ardex Reinforcing Fabric, Gripset Elastoproof Bandage, Bostik Dampfix Bandage, Mapei Mapeband, Sika Sealtape S, Crommelin Flexible Reinforcing Tape. Fabric width is typically 100mm or 150mm. Some products (e.g., Ardex WPM 001 Superflex) contain integrated micro-fibres that reduce or eliminate the need for separate reinforcement tape on floors — but reinforcement at corners and junctions is still required. |
| **Bond breaker vs reinforcement** | In practice, many Australian waterproofers use a single product that serves as both bond breaker and reinforcement at corners. The term "bond breaker tape" and "reinforcement tape" are often used interchangeably in Australian trade language. The key difference is: **bond breaker** = prevents the membrane from bonding to the substrate in the corner (allows movement); **reinforcement** = adds tensile strength to the membrane at the stress point. A properly installed corner detail achieves both functions. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required at all junctions, corners, and stress points per AS 3740:2021 and all membrane manufacturer specifications. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires junction treatment at all wall/floor and wall/wall junctions. Membrane manufacturers universally require reinforcement at these locations. Using a membrane without reinforcement at junctions is non-compliant with manufacturer instructions and therefore non-compliant with AS 3740. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not fully encapsulating the fabric — exposed edges allow water ingress behind the membrane. (2) Using fabric that is too narrow — should overlap at least 50mm onto each surface. (3) Not overlapping fabric at intersecting junctions. (4) Applying fabric over a cured membrane coat without adequate adhesion — the fabric must be embedded in wet membrane. (5) Wrinkles or air bubbles under the fabric — create weak points. (6) Using a non-compatible fabric with the membrane product. |

### A5. Pipe Penetration Preparation — Puddle Flanges

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A puddle flange is a PVC or stainless steel flange (roughly the diameter of a dinner plate, typically 200-250mm) that connects the waterproofing membrane to the drainage system at the floor waste point. It provides a generous flat bonding surface around the drain outlet where the membrane can be sealed to create a continuous waterproof barrier from the floor surface to the drainage pipe. Without a puddle flange, there is no reliable way to connect the membrane to the drain — water would simply flow between the membrane and the drain fitting. |
| **What it involves** | **Plumber's role:** The plumber installs the floor waste drain pipe (PVC waste pipe, typically 80mm or 100mm) and sets it at the correct height within the screed. The plumber may also install a drainage flange component at the pipe outlet. **Waterproofer's role:** The waterproofer installs the puddle flange over the drain pipe, ensuring it sits flush or slightly recessed into the floor screed. The flange is typically bedded into a sealant or adhesive to create an initial seal. The waterproofing membrane is then applied over the puddle flange's bonding surface, creating a continuous sealed connection from the membrane to the drain. The flange must be installed *before* the membrane is applied. |
| **Who installs it** | This is a shared responsibility between the plumber and the waterproofer: **(1)** The **plumber** installs the drain pipe and the lower drainage component (the waste pipe connection). **(2)** The **waterproofer** installs the puddle flange component that receives the membrane. Both trades must coordinate — the drain pipe must be at the correct height and position for the flange to sit properly. In practice, the waterproofer typically takes responsibility for the flange installation. |
| **Typical products** | Allproof Puddle Flange (PVC, suits 80mm and 100mm PVC pipe), Wondercap Puddle Flange, Puddle Pro flanges, Builder's Choice Puddle Flange. Available to suit 50mm, 65mm, 80mm, and 100mm PVC pipe sizes. The most common size for bathroom floor wastes is 80mm or 100mm. The flange consists of a body that fits into the pipe, a flat bonding ring that sits on the floor surface, and a removable grate or waste fitting on top. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required at every floor waste drain in a waterproofed area. There is no compliant alternative for connecting the membrane to the drainage system. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires that penetrations through the membrane be waterproofed. The puddle flange is the standard method for floor waste penetrations. The flange must be compatible with the membrane system. The membrane must overlap the flange bonding surface by a minimum distance specified by the flange manufacturer (typically at least 50mm beyond the edge of the drain). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing a puddle flange at all — the membrane cannot be reliably sealed to a bare PVC pipe. (2) Flange installed at the wrong height — too high creates a bump in the finished floor; too low creates a depression where water pools around the edge. (3) Flange not properly bedded — gaps between the flange and the screed allow water to bypass the seal. (4) Membrane not properly adhered to the flange surface — insufficient coverage or poor bonding. (5) Not using bond breaker/bandage tape where the membrane meets the flange (where recommended by the flange manufacturer). (6) Not coordinating between the plumber and waterproofer — misaligned drain position causes problems. |

### A6. Membrane Application — Liquid-Applied Membrane

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A liquid waterproofing membrane applied by brush, roller, or trowel to form a continuous, seamless, elastomeric waterproof barrier on the substrate. Liquid-applied membranes are by far the most common waterproofing method used in Australian bathroom renovations. Once cured, the liquid forms a tough, flexible rubber-like film that is bonded to the substrate and prevents water from passing through. |
| **What it involves** | **(1) First coat:** The membrane liquid is applied by brush or medium-nap roller to the prepared, primed substrate. All bond breaker/reinforcement tape is embedded into this first coat at junctions and corners. The first coat is applied in one direction (e.g., horizontal strokes). **(2) Drying:** The first coat must dry completely before the second coat. Drying time varies by product and conditions — typically 1-4 hours at 23 degrees C and 50% relative humidity. Some rapid-cure products allow a second coat after 30-60 minutes. The membrane will typically change colour as it dries (see colour contrast below). **(3) Second coat:** Applied in the opposite direction to the first coat (e.g., vertical strokes if the first was horizontal). This cross-hatch application pattern ensures complete coverage and eliminates pinholes or thin spots. **(4) Curing:** After the final coat, the membrane must cure for a minimum period before tiling or flood testing. Cure times vary: standard products require 16-24 hours before tiling, 24-72 hours before flood testing. Rapid-cure products may allow tiling in 4 hours. |
| **Number of coats** | **Minimum 2 coats** for all liquid-applied membranes in Australia. This is a universal requirement across all manufacturers and is essential for achieving the minimum dry film thickness (DFT). Applying a single thick coat is NOT acceptable — it causes surface skinning (the surface cures faster than the interior), trapped air bubbles, pinholes, and uneven thickness. Some systems or situations may require 3 coats (e.g., to achieve DFT on floors where the membrane must be thicker). |
| **Minimum dry film thickness (DFT)** | AS 3740:2021 does not specify an exact DFT — it requires the membrane to comply with AS/NZS 4858:2004 (Wet Area Membranes) and be installed per manufacturer's instructions. In practice, the manufacturer specifies the required DFT, which typically ranges from: **Floors and horizontal surfaces:** 1.0mm minimum DFT (achieved by applying 1.5 L/m2 of product in 2-3 coats, depending on the product's solids content). **Walls:** 0.5-1.0mm minimum DFT depending on the product. **The key calculation:** DFT = Wet Film Thickness (WFT) x % Volume Solids of the product. For a product with 66% solids: to achieve 1.0mm DFT, you need approximately 1.5mm WFT, which typically requires 2-3 coats at approximately 0.5-0.75mm WFT per coat. |
| **Wet film thickness testing** | Not mandated by AS 3740 but is best practice and increasingly required by certifiers. A wet film thickness (WFT) gauge is a simple comb-like tool pressed into the freshly applied membrane to measure the thickness of the wet coat. The WFT reading is then converted to DFT using the product's volume solids percentage. This allows the applicator to verify coverage *during* application rather than discovering thin spots after curing. Some quality-conscious waterproofers and all major projects use WFT gauges. |
| **Colour contrast between coats** | Many Australian waterproofing products use a two-colour system where the first coat and second coat are different colours (or the wet and dry states are different colours). This is a quality-assurance feature — the colour contrast makes it visually obvious whether the second coat has achieved full coverage over the first coat. If the first-coat colour is visible through the second coat, coverage is insufficient. Examples: Ardex WPM 002 uses contrasting colours between coats; Gripset 38FC changes colour as it dries; Sikalastic WPU dries to a different shade. |
| **Membrane type options (Australian market)** | See Section D1 for a full product comparison table. The main categories are: **Acrylic polymer (single component):** Pre-mixed, easy to apply, moderate drying time. E.g., Ardex WPM 001, Gripset 38FC. **Modified acrylic-polyurethane hybrid (single component):** Pre-mixed with enhanced flexibility and fast cure. E.g., Ardex WPM 155 Rapid Plus. **Two-component acrylic:** Liquid and powder mixed on-site, faster drying, higher performance. E.g., Ardex WPM 002. **Polyurethane (single component):** Higher flexibility and elongation. E.g., Sikalastic WPU, Mapei Mapelastic AquaDefense. All products must be tested and classified to AS/NZS 4858:2004. |
| **Application rates** | Vary by product. Typical coverage: 1.3-1.5 L/m2 total (across 2-3 coats) for floors; 0.8-1.3 L/m2 total for walls. Always check the specific product data sheet — coverage rates are the primary determinant of DFT compliance. Applying too little product is the most common application failure. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — liquid-applied membrane is the most common waterproofing method for Australian bathroom renovations. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Membrane must comply with AS/NZS 4858:2004. Installation must comply with AS 3740:2021 and the manufacturer's instructions. The applicator must be a licensed waterproofing contractor. A compliance certificate must be issued. The membrane must be inspected before being covered (mandatory inspection in VIC; best practice / required by certifier in other states). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) **Insufficient thickness** — applying the membrane too thin is the number one failure. Use a WFT gauge. (2) **Not allowing adequate drying between coats** — applying the second coat over an uncured first coat traps moisture and creates delamination. (3) **Applying both coats in the same direction** — use cross-hatch (perpendicular) application. (4) **Applying a single thick coat instead of multiple thin coats** — causes surface skinning, bubbles, and pinholes. (5) **Skipping the primer** — leading cause of adhesion failure. (6) **Applying in adverse conditions** — below 5 degrees C or above 35 degrees C, in direct sunlight, or in high humidity will compromise the cure. (7) **Not treating junctions with bond breaker/reinforcement** — the membrane cracks at corners. (8) **Tiling before the membrane is fully cured** — compromises the membrane integrity. (9) **Not applying membrane to the required height on walls.** (10) **Using a non-compliant or untested product** — must be tested to AS/NZS 4858. |

### A7. Membrane Application — Sheet Membrane

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A pre-formed, flexible sheet membrane (typically polyethylene, PVC, or modified bituminous rubber) applied to the substrate as a continuous sheet barrier. Sheet membranes provide consistent, factory-controlled thickness across their entire area — unlike liquid membranes where thickness depends on the applicator's skill. |
| **When used instead of liquid** | Sheet membranes are less common for internal wet areas (bathrooms) in Australia. They are more commonly used for: **(1) External applications** — balconies, podiums, and rooftop areas where UV resistance and consistent thickness are critical (see Section C1). **(2) Large flat surfaces** — where the consistent thickness of a factory-made sheet is advantageous. **(3) Specific structural situations** — where movement or crack bridging requirements exceed the capability of liquid membranes. **For standard bathroom renovations, liquid-applied membranes are overwhelmingly preferred** because they conform easily to complex geometries (corners, junctions, penetrations) and form a seamless bond. Sheet membranes require lapped joints that must be welded or sealed, which are potential failure points. |
| **What it involves** | The sheet is rolled out over the prepared substrate. Joints between sheets are overlapped (typically 50-100mm overlap) and sealed by heat welding, solvent welding, or self-adhesive lapping. All corners, junctions, and penetrations require additional detailing with liquid membrane or specialised pre-formed corner pieces. The sheet must be bonded to the substrate (fully adhered, partially adhered, or mechanically fixed depending on the system). |
| **Typical products (Australia)** | Ardex WPM 1000 (polypropylene sheet, heat-welded joints), Ardex WPM 3000X (SBS self-adhesive bituminous sheet), Sika Sarnafil (PVC sheet for external use), various polyethylene sheet membranes. **Important note:** A 0.2mm polyethylene sheet (builder's plastic) is NOT a waterproofing membrane. It is a vapour barrier only and does not meet AS/NZS 4858 or AS 3740 requirements for wet area waterproofing. This is a common misconception in Australian construction. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — sheet membranes are a valid alternative to liquid-applied membranes but are uncommon for standard bathroom renovations. Liquid membranes are the industry standard for bathrooms. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Must comply with AS/NZS 4858:2004. Sheet must be properly lapped and sealed at all joints. Corners and penetrations typically require additional treatment with a compatible liquid membrane. Must be installed per manufacturer's instructions by a licensed applicator. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Assuming builder's plastic (0.2mm polyethylene) is a waterproofing membrane — it is not. (2) Inadequate overlap and sealing at sheet joints — the lapped joints are the primary failure point. (3) Not detailing corners and penetrations properly — sheet membranes cannot fold neatly into corners and always need supplementary detailing. (4) Using a sheet membrane not tested to AS/NZS 4858. (5) Not fully adhering the sheet to the substrate — unbonded areas can shift and create voids. |

| **What it is** | A combination waterproofing system uses both sheet membrane and liquid-applied membrane in the same installation. Typically, the sheet membrane is used for the main floor area (where consistent thickness is desired), and the liquid membrane is used for corners, junctions, penetrations, and walls (where the sheet cannot conform to complex shapes). |
| **When used** | Combination systems are used in more complex or high-risk situations: upper-level bathrooms over habitable spaces, balconies, large commercial wet areas, and situations requiring enhanced performance. In standard residential bathroom renovations, a pure liquid system is more common. |
| **What it involves** | The sheet membrane is laid on the floor. The edges of the sheet are overlapped with liquid membrane at wall/floor junctions. Liquid membrane is applied to walls and around penetrations, overlapping the sheet membrane on the floor by a specified distance (typically 100-150mm). The overlap area must form a continuous, sealed bond between the two membrane types. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — rarely used in standard bathroom renovations. More common in high-risk or commercial applications. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Both the sheet and liquid components must comply with AS/NZS 4858:2004. The system as a whole must be tested and approved — combining products from different manufacturers without testing is not recommended and may not be compliant. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using incompatible sheet and liquid products — always use products from the same manufacturer's system. (2) Insufficient overlap between sheet and liquid membrane zones — a minimum of 100mm overlap is typically required. (3) Not properly bonding the sheet edges to the liquid membrane — debonding at the overlap is a critical failure point. |

### A9. Shower Floor Waterproofing (Including Hob / Step-Down)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Complete waterproofing of the shower recess floor, including the shower hob (raised lip at the shower entry) or step-down (where the shower floor is recessed below the main bathroom floor). The shower floor is the highest-risk area in the entire bathroom — it receives the most direct water contact and must be 100% waterproof with correct falls to the floor waste. |
| **What it involves** | The entire shower floor must be waterproofed with the membrane system — from the walls inward to the floor waste. This includes: the horizontal floor surface graded to falls, the vertical face of the hob or step-down (inside and outside), the top of the hob, all floor/wall junctions within the shower (with bond breaker/reinforcement), and the connection to the floor waste via a puddle flange. The membrane must be continuous and unbroken across all these surfaces. |
| **Hob vs step-down vs level entry** | **Hob (raised lip):** A raised barrier (typically 10-20mm above finished floor level) at the shower entry that physically prevents water from flowing out of the shower. The hob itself must be waterproofed on all surfaces (top, both vertical faces). This is the traditional and most reliable method. **Step-down (recessed floor):** The shower floor is set lower than the main bathroom floor, creating a step down into the shower. Achieves the same containment as a hob but with a flush entry point. More complex to construct. **Level entry (barrier-free):** No hob or step-down — the shower floor is at the same level as the bathroom floor, with a channel drain at the threshold. Required for accessible bathrooms per NCC 2022 livable housing provisions. Requires precise falls and a robust threshold drainage detail. AS 3740:2021 permits all three configurations, with specific waterproofing requirements for each. |
| **Fall requirements** | Shower floor: minimum 1:80 (12.5mm per metre), maximum 1:50 (20mm per metre) toward the floor waste. The floor waste must be the lowest point in the shower recess. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required for every shower in a bathroom. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires the shower floor, including any hob or step-down, to be waterproof. The wall/floor junctions within the shower must be waterproof. The floor waste must be waterproofed (puddle flange). The membrane must be graded (follow the falls). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing all surfaces of the hob — the hob top and both vertical faces must be covered. (2) Insufficient fall to the floor waste — water pools in corners or against the hob. (3) Not properly sealing the membrane to the puddle flange at the floor waste. (4) Leaving the shower hob/wall junction untreated — a high-stress point that needs reinforcement. (5) Membrane damage during subsequent trades (tiling, fixture installation). |

### A10. Shower Wall Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the shower walls from the floor up to the required height. Shower walls receive significant direct water contact from the shower head, and the wall lining material (typically fibre cement sheet or moisture-resistant plasterboard) must be protected by a waterproof membrane. |
| **Height requirements — AS 3740:2021** | The entire water-resistant wall lining in the shower area must be waterproofed to a minimum height of **1800mm above the finished floor level** OR **50mm above the shower rose (shower head), whichever is higher**. This is a critical requirement. For a standard shower with the rose at approximately 2000-2100mm height, the 1800mm minimum is sufficient. For rain showers or high-set roses above 1750mm, the membrane must extend 50mm above the rose — which may mean full ceiling-height waterproofing. |
| **Full-height waterproofing** | Although AS 3740:2021 only mandates waterproofing to 1800mm (or 50mm above the rose), **best practice in Australia is to waterproof shower walls to full height (ceiling level)**. The reasons: steam and condensation reach the ceiling; overhead "rain" shower heads are increasingly popular and are often set very high; the cost difference between 1800mm and full height is minimal; and most membrane manufacturers recommend full height. **The ScopeAI output should recommend full-height shower wall waterproofing as the preferred option**, noting the minimum requirement is 1800mm / 50mm above the rose. |
| **What it involves** | Applying the membrane system (primer + 2 coats minimum of liquid membrane) to all shower walls from the floor level up to the specified height. All wall/wall junctions (corners) within the shower must be reinforced with bond breaker/fabric tape. All wall/floor junctions must be reinforced. All penetrations through the walls (shower mixer, shower head arm, recessed shelving) must be sealed. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required for every shower. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 — minimum 1800mm or 50mm above shower rose, whichever is higher. The membrane must comply with AS/NZS 4858:2004. Wall lining must be water-resistant (fibre cement sheet or MR plasterboard — standard plasterboard is not permitted in shower areas). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Only waterproofing to 1500mm or 1800mm when the shower rose is above 1750mm — must check the rose height and apply the 50mm-above-rose rule. (2) Not waterproofing behind a fixed shower screen panel — water splashes behind the screen. (3) Missing wall/wall corner junctions — these are high-stress points. (4) Using standard plasterboard as the wall lining in the shower — only MR plasterboard or fibre cement is permitted. (5) Not priming the wall substrate before membrane application. (6) Damaging the membrane when installing the shower mixer or other fixtures after waterproofing. |

### A11. Over-Bath Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of walls adjacent to a bath (freestanding or built-in) and, if a shower is positioned over the bath, waterproofing to shower-equivalent heights. The requirements differ significantly depending on whether the bath has a shower over it or is bath-only. |
| **Bath-only (no shower over)** | Walls adjacent to inserted baths and spas must be waterproof to not less than **150mm above the lip (rim) of the bath**, for the full extent of the bath where it is within 75mm of a wall. Any shelf area adjoining the bath must be waterproof and include a waterstop under the vessel lip. Tap and spout penetrations must be waterproofed where they occur in horizontal surfaces. **Note:** There is no AS 3740 requirement for the floor *under* a freestanding or inserted bath to be waterproofed. However, the floor around the bath must be water-resistant (and waterproof if timber-framed — see A12). |
| **Shower over bath** | If a shower is positioned over a bath, the area is treated as a shower for waterproofing purposes. Walls within the shower zone must be waterproofed to a minimum of **1800mm above the finished floor level** (not above the bath rim) or **50mm above the shower rose**, whichever is higher. For showers over freestanding baths, if any part of a wall falls within a 1500mm radius from the shower rose (without a screen), that wall must be waterproofed to 1800mm minimum from the floor. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — waterproofing is required wherever a bath is adjacent to a wall. The extent depends on configuration (bath-only vs shower-over-bath). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 specifies different height requirements for bath-only (150mm above rim) versus shower-over-bath (1800mm / 50mm above rose). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Confusing bath-only and shower-over-bath requirements — very different height specifications. (2) Only waterproofing to 150mm above the bath rim when there is a shower over the bath — must go to 1800mm minimum from the floor. (3) Not waterproofing the shelf/hob area under an inserted bath. (4) Not waterproofing behind a freestanding bath that is close to the wall. |

---

### A12. General Bathroom Floor Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the general bathroom floor outside the shower area. The requirement for full-floor waterproofing depends on the substrate type (concrete vs timber) and the bathroom's location within the building (ground floor vs upper level). |
| **Concrete slab floors (ground floor)** | For a ground-floor bathroom with a concrete slab substrate, the bathroom floor **outside the shower area** needs to be **water-resistant** — not necessarily fully waterproof. Water resistance can be achieved by tile and grout with appropriate water-resistant adhesive on a concrete substrate. However, **best practice in Australia (and the most common approach) is to waterproof the entire bathroom floor regardless of substrate**, because: it provides superior protection; the cost difference is minimal; it simplifies the scope; and many certifiers expect it. |
| **Timber or wood-based floors** | If the bathroom has timber framing, particleboard, plywood, or any wood-based flooring material, **the entire bathroom floor must be waterproofed** — not just the shower area. This is a specific AS 3740:2021 requirement. Timber-framed floors are more vulnerable to water damage and require the full waterproof barrier. This applies to virtually all upper-level (first floor and above) bathrooms in Australian residential construction, as these are almost universally timber-framed. |
| **Upper-level bathrooms** | Any bathroom on an upper level (above habitable space below) requires **full floor waterproofing** because: the substrate is almost always timber-framed; water damage from an upper-level bathroom leaks directly onto the ceiling/room below; and the consequences of failure are severe (structural damage, mould, ceiling collapse). See Section C3 for enhanced requirements. |
| **What it involves** | Applying the full membrane system (primer + 2 coats minimum) to the entire bathroom floor. The membrane must turn up the walls at the perimeter by a minimum of 100-150mm (some specifications require the membrane to extend up to the height of the first tile course). All floor/wall junctions must be reinforced. All penetrations must be sealed. The membrane must be graded to fall toward the floor waste (where one is provided). |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD for timber/upper-level floors** (mandatory under AS 3740:2021). **Best practice for concrete slab floors** (not strictly mandatory for the non-shower area but universally recommended and almost always done in renovations). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 mandates full floor waterproofing where the substrate is timber or wood-based. NCC 2022 Part 10.2 references AS 3740. The membrane must be graded where a floor waste is provided. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing the full floor on a timber-framed upper level — a code breach. (2) Assuming a concrete slab doesn't need waterproofing outside the shower — while not strictly mandatory, it's best practice and most certifiers expect it. (3) Not turning the membrane up the walls at the floor perimeter. (4) Not providing falls to the floor waste in the general bathroom area. (5) Waterproofing only the shower and leaving the rest of the floor unprotected — risky even on concrete slab. |

### A13. Door Threshold / Hob Detail

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The waterproofing detail at the bathroom door threshold — the transition point where the waterproofed bathroom floor meets the non-waterproofed corridor/hallway floor. This is a critical detail because it is the primary barrier preventing water from migrating out of the bathroom and into adjacent rooms. A waterstop must be installed at this location. |
| **What it involves** | A **waterstop** is installed at the bathroom door threshold as part of the waterproofing system. The waterstop is a raised barrier (typically 5-10mm above finished floor level) integrated into the waterproofing membrane that prevents any water under the tile surface from escaping the wet area. The membrane extends from the bathroom floor up and over the waterstop. The waterstop must be: sealed to the perimeter flashing (the membrane turn-up at the wall/floor junction) on both sides of the doorway; continuous across the full width of the doorway; and integral with the membrane — installed by the waterproofer to ensure compatibility. |
| **Waterstop options** | **Hob (raised threshold):** A small raised step (10-20mm) at the doorway. Most traditional and reliable. Can be a trip hazard and may not meet accessibility requirements. **Step-down:** The bathroom floor is set slightly lower than the corridor floor, creating a natural water barrier. Requires planning during the screed/slab stage. **Level threshold with channel drain:** A flush threshold with a linear drain channel set just inside the bathroom doorway. Water is intercepted and directed to the drain before it can reach the threshold. Required for accessible bathrooms and increasingly preferred for modern design. Requires precise falls and robust drainage. **Concealed waterstop strip:** A thin metal or PVC waterstop strip set into the substrate at the threshold, with the membrane sealed to it. The strip sits below the finished tile surface and acts as a hidden barrier. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — a waterstop at the bathroom doorway is required by AS 3740:2021 to prevent water migration out of the wet area. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires waterstops at wet area doorways. The waterstop must be integral with the waterproofing membrane and installed by the waterproofer using compatible products. NCC 2022 livable housing provisions may require barrier-free (level) thresholds for accessibility, which requires careful waterproofing design. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Omitting the waterstop entirely — water migrates under the tiles into the hallway, causing damage to timber flooring, carpet, or the subfloor structure. (2) Waterstop not sealed to the membrane on both sides — creates a gap for water to bypass. (3) Waterstop installed by the tiler instead of the waterproofer — may use incompatible products. (4) Relying on silicon sealant at the threshold instead of a proper waterstop — sealant deteriorates and fails. (5) Not coordinating the threshold detail with the finished floor levels on both sides of the doorway. |

### A14. Toilet Area Waterproofing

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the floor and penetrations in the toilet area of a bathroom. Where the toilet is within the same room as the shower, it is part of the general bathroom floor waterproofing. Where the toilet is in a separate room (separate WC/powder room), the requirements differ. |
| **Toilet within the bathroom** | Where the toilet is located within a waterproofed bathroom, the toilet area floor is waterproofed as part of the general bathroom floor (see A12). The toilet waste penetration (the hole through the floor for the toilet pan outlet) must be waterproofed as a penetration (see A19). |
| **Separate toilet room (no floor waste)** | A separate toilet room (WC) without a shower and without a floor waste is **not classified as a wet area** under AS 3740:2021. Waterproofing of the floor is **not mandatory**. However, the floor/wall junction and any penetrations (toilet waste pipe) should be water-resistant. Many builders and certifiers still recommend waterproofing the floor around the toilet pan and the waste penetration as a precaution. |
| **Separate toilet room (with floor waste)** | If a separate toilet room has a floor waste (uncommon but possible), it is treated as a wet area and the floor must be waterproofed and graded to the floor waste per AS 3740:2021. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** when the toilet is within a waterproofed bathroom. **OPTIONAL** (but recommended) for a separate toilet room without a floor waste. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing the toilet waste penetration — even in a separate toilet room, the floor penetration should be sealed. (2) Not providing adequate membrane coverage around the toilet pan position — the pan is removed and reinstalled during renovations, and the membrane must protect the floor beneath. |

---

### A15. Vanity Area Waterproofing

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the floor and walls in the vanity basin area of a bathroom. The vanity area is part of the general bathroom and falls within the bathroom waterproofing scope. |
| **Floor under vanity** | The floor beneath a vanity unit is waterproofed as part of the general bathroom floor waterproofing. AS 3740 does not have a specific separate requirement for the vanity area floor — it is covered by the general bathroom floor requirements (see A12). **Best practice:** the vanity should be installed **on top of** the finished, tiled, waterproofed floor — not before tiling. Installing the vanity before waterproofing/tiling creates a break in the membrane and a gap where water can penetrate. If the vanity must be installed before tiling, the membrane should be returned up the vertical surface of the vanity kickboard to the top of the finished floor level. |
| **Wall behind vanity** | Walls behind a vanity basin do not have a specific waterproofing height requirement beyond the general bathroom wall requirement (water-resistant to at least 150mm above finished floor level). However, **best practice** is to waterproof the wall behind the vanity to at least 200-300mm above the vanity top (benchtop) to protect against splashes and overflow. The wall must be water-resistant (fibre cement or MR plasterboard as the wall lining). |
| **Pipe penetrations** | Hot and cold water supply penetrations to the vanity basin mixer must be sealed — see A17. The waste pipe penetration for the vanity drain must also be sealed. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** as part of general bathroom waterproofing. No specific additional requirements beyond the general bathroom scope. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing the floor before installing the vanity — the vanity should go on top of the finished floor. (2) Not sealing pipe penetrations behind the vanity — splashes and condensation can enter the wall cavity. (3) Using standard plasterboard behind the vanity instead of MR plasterboard or fibre cement. |

---

### A16. Floor Waste Puddle Flange

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The puddle flange specifically at the floor waste drain point. This is the most critical penetration detail in the entire waterproofing system — it is the point where the membrane must transition from the horizontal floor surface to the vertical drain pipe, and any failure here allows water to flow directly under the membrane and into the building structure. (See also A5 for preparation details.) |
| **What it involves** | **(1)** The puddle flange is set into the screed, centred over the drain pipe, at the correct finished height (flush with or slightly below the surrounding screed surface). **(2)** The flange is bedded with sealant to the screed. **(3)** Bond breaker tape is applied around the perimeter of the flange where it meets the screed (some systems). **(4)** The membrane is applied over the entire flange bonding surface, overlapping a minimum of 50mm beyond the outer edge of the flange. **(5)** After the membrane cures, the floor waste grate/insert is fitted into the flange. **(6)** The tiler tiles up to the edge of the grate. |
| **Key dimensions** | Flange bonding ring diameter: typically 200-250mm. Drain pipe connection: 80mm or 100mm PVC. The flange must be rebated into the screed so its top surface is level with or slightly below the surrounding membrane surface — if the flange sits proud (above the surface), it creates a dam around the drain that prevents water from reaching it. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required at every floor waste in a waterproofed area. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Flange sitting proud of the surrounding surface — water pools around the flange instead of draining into it. (2) Membrane not properly adhered to the flange bonding surface — delamination at the flange edge is a common failure point. (3) Not enough membrane overlap beyond the flange edge. (4) Using a flange that is incompatible with the membrane system. (5) Flange damaged during tiling or subsequent trades. (6) No sealant bed between the flange and the screed. |

---

### A17. Pipe Penetration Sealing (Hot/Cold Water, Waste Pipes)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Sealing of all pipe penetrations through the waterproofed surfaces — every hole through the membrane for water supply pipes (hot and cold), waste pipes, and any other services must be waterproofed to prevent water from tracking along the pipe and through the membrane. |
| **What it involves** | For each pipe penetration: **(1)** The gap between the pipe and the substrate (wall lining or floor) should not exceed 8mm — if the gap is larger, the substrate must be repaired or replaced. **(2)** The gap is filled with a flexible polyurethane sealant that bonds to both the pipe and the substrate. **(3)** The membrane is applied over the sealant and around the pipe, typically using a combination of liquid membrane and reinforcement tape/fabric. The membrane must extend a minimum of 50-75mm beyond the penetration point in all directions. **(4)** For floor penetrations, the membrane must wrap up the pipe shaft by a minimum of 50mm above finished floor level. |
| **Typical products** | Polyurethane sealant (not silicon — silicon does not bond well to most substrates and is not suitable under tiles). Neutral-cure sealants compatible with the membrane system. Products: Sikaflex, Bostik Seal N Flex, Ardex SE sealant. Reinforcement tape cut into patches or strips around the penetration. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every penetration through a waterproofed surface must be sealed per AS 3740:2021. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 requires that all penetrations in waterproofed areas be waterproofed. The sealing must be done using products compatible with the membrane system. The gap around the pipe must be within acceptable limits (typically max 8mm). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using silicon sealant instead of polyurethane — silicon does not bond adequately and is not suitable under tiles. (2) Gaps too large around the pipe — substrate must be repaired before sealing. (3) Not wrapping the membrane up the pipe at floor penetrations. (4) Not applying reinforcement tape/fabric around the penetration — the sealant alone is not sufficient. (5) Sealing pipe penetrations after the membrane is applied (as an afterthought) instead of integrating them into the membrane application. (6) Damage to the seal during subsequent fixture installation (e.g., installing the shower mixer after waterproofing — the plumber/waterproofer must coordinate). |

---

### A18. Shower Mixer Penetration

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The waterproofing detail at the shower mixer valve penetration through the shower wall. The shower mixer (or separate hot and cold taps) requires holes through the waterproofed wall for the mixer cartridge body and/or supply pipes. This is a high-risk penetration because it is located in the direct water spray zone of the shower. |
| **What it involves** | **(1)** The plumber installs the mixer cartridge (or rough-in valve body) within the wall. The cartridge protrudes through the wall lining (fibre cement or MR plasterboard). **(2)** The gap between the mixer cartridge and the edge of the wall lining must not exceed 8mm. If the gap is larger, the sheet must be replaced or repaired. **(3)** A polyurethane sealant is applied between the mixer cartridge and the wall lining to create a primary seal. This must be done *before* the waterproofing membrane is applied. **(4)** The waterproofing membrane is applied over the sealant and around the mixer cartridge, extending at least 50-75mm beyond the penetration in all directions. **(5)** After waterproofing, tiling, and grouting, a second seal is installed between the finished tile/grout surface and the back of the mixer cover plate (escutcheon). Some mixer cover plates have an integrated soft foam seal on the back face. |
| **Critical coordination** | The plumber must install the mixer rough-in **before** the waterproofer applies the membrane. The waterproofer seals around the mixer cartridge. The plumber then returns **after** tiling to install the handle, cover plate, and any trim. This coordination is essential — if the plumber installs the mixer after waterproofing, they may damage the membrane. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required for every shower with a mixer valve or tapware penetrating the waterproofed wall. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Gap between mixer cartridge and wall exceeding 8mm — compromises the seal. (2) Not sealing the mixer penetration before applying the membrane — the sealant must go in first. (3) Plumber damaging the membrane when returning to install the mixer trim — must be careful. (4) Relying on the mixer cover plate alone to prevent water ingress — the cover plate is a secondary seal, not the primary waterproofing. (5) Not using a compatible sealant — must bond to both the mixer body (typically brass or plastic) and the wall lining. |

---

### A19. Toilet Waste Penetration

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The waterproofing seal around the toilet waste pipe penetration through the bathroom floor. The toilet pan outlet pipe (typically 100mm PVC) passes through the floor substrate, creating a penetration in the waterproofed floor. |
| **What it involves** | The toilet waste pipe penetration is sealed similarly to other floor penetrations — the gap between the pipe and the substrate is filled with sealant, and the membrane is applied around the pipe with reinforcement. However, the toilet waste pipe is larger (100mm) than water supply pipes, requiring more careful detailing. In some installations, a toilet-specific puddle flange or collar is used around the waste pipe. The membrane must wrap up the pipe by a minimum of 50mm above the finished floor level. |
| **Coordination with plumber** | The plumber sets the toilet waste pipe position and height. The waterproofer seals the penetration. After tiling, the plumber installs the toilet pan with a wax ring or rubber seal to the waste pipe. The toilet pan bolts down to the floor through the finished tiles — these bolt holes must be sealed with sealant to prevent water from penetrating the floor. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required wherever a toilet is located within a waterproofed area. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not sealing the waste pipe penetration because it is in the "dry" part of the bathroom — water can still reach this point via floor washing or overflow. (2) Not sealing the toilet pan bolt holes through the tiles after installation. (3) Membrane not wrapping up the waste pipe sufficiently. |

---

### A20. Waterproofing Compliance Certificate

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A formal compliance certificate issued by the licensed waterproofing contractor confirming that the waterproofing work has been completed in accordance with AS 3740:2021, the NCC, and the membrane manufacturer's instructions. This certificate is a mandatory part of the building approval process and must be retained by the homeowner. |
| **What it involves** | The waterproofing contractor: **(1)** Completes the waterproofing installation. **(2)** Allows the membrane to cure. **(3)** In Victoria, a mandatory inspection by a building surveyor/inspector must occur **before** the membrane is covered by tiles. In other states, the certifier/building surveyor typically requires an inspection or at minimum a compliance certificate from the licensed applicator. **(4)** The contractor issues a written compliance certificate documenting: the products used, application rates, number of coats, areas waterproofed, heights achieved, curing times, and confirmation of compliance with AS 3740:2021. **(5)** Photos should be taken of the membrane before tiling — this provides evidence of the waterproofing coverage in the event of future dispute or claim. |
| **State-specific requirements** | **VIC:** Mandatory waterproofing inspection by a building surveyor before covering the membrane — this became law under Victorian building regulations. **NSW:** Waterproofing work valued over $5,000 (or part of a larger home building project) must be done by a licensed contractor. A compliance certificate is required for building approval. **QLD:** Waterproofing work valued over $3,300 must be done by a licensed contractor (QBCC licence). Certificate required. **SA, WA, TAS, ACT, NT:** Licensing and certification requirements vary — check with the local building authority. All states require the work to comply with AS 3740 and the NCC. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — the compliance certificate is mandatory for building approval and should be retained by the homeowner for the life of the building. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Tiling over the membrane before inspection — once tiled, the membrane cannot be inspected and may need to be removed. (2) Not obtaining a written compliance certificate — verbal assurances are insufficient. (3) Using an unlicensed waterproofer — the certificate is invalid and the work is non-compliant. (4) Not photographing the membrane before tiling — photos are critical evidence. (5) Losing the compliance certificate — it should be filed with the property records. |

## B. Laundry Waterproofing

Laundry waterproofing requirements in Australia depend on whether the laundry has a floor waste, the substrate type, and the configuration of wet fixtures. AS 3740:2021 and NCC 2022 treat the laundry as a "wet area" but with requirements that differ from a bathroom.

---

### B1. Laundry Floor Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the laundry room floor. The requirements depend on whether the laundry has a floor waste and the type of floor substrate. |
| **Laundry with floor waste** | Where a floor waste is provided in a laundry, **the floor, floor/wall junctions, and all penetrations must be waterproof** per AS 3740:2021. The floor must be graded to fall toward the floor waste (minimum 1:80, maximum 1:50). This is the same requirement as a bathroom floor. A puddle flange is required at the floor waste. The membrane must turn up the walls at the perimeter by a minimum of 100-150mm. |
| **Laundry without floor waste** | Where no floor waste is provided, **full floor waterproofing is not mandatory** under AS 3740:2021. However, the floor/wall junctions and any penetrations (washing machine taps, laundry tub waste) must be water-resistant. **Best practice** is still to waterproof the full laundry floor — washing machines and laundry tubs are significant sources of water spillage and overflow. Most builders and certifiers recommend full floor waterproofing for laundries. |
| **Timber floors** | If the laundry has a timber or wood-based floor substrate (upper-level laundry), **the entire floor must be waterproofed** regardless of whether a floor waste is present — the same timber floor rule applies as for bathrooms. |
| **What it involves** | Same as bathroom floor waterproofing: primer + 2 coats minimum of membrane + bond breaker at junctions + puddle flange at floor waste (if present). |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** where a floor waste is provided or the floor is timber-framed. **OPTIONAL but strongly recommended** for concrete slab laundries without a floor waste. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Assuming a laundry doesn't need waterproofing because it has no shower — the floor waste requirement triggers full waterproofing. (2) Not waterproofing a timber-framed laundry floor — code breach. (3) Not providing a floor waste in the laundry at all — while not mandatory in all situations, a floor waste is strongly recommended as it provides overflow protection for washing machines and tubs. |

---

### B2. Behind Washing Machine

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the wall and floor area directly behind the washing machine, where the water supply taps and waste hose connection are located. This is a high-risk area for leaks from hose connections, tap failures, and washing machine overflows. |
| **Wall requirements** | The wall behind the washing machine where tap outlets are located must be **water-resistant**. Where the washing machine is within 75mm of a wall, the wall must be water-resistant to at least 150mm above the top of the machine. **Best practice** is to waterproof the wall behind the washing machine to at least 1200mm above the floor (the height of the tap outlets) — this provides protection against supply hose failure and splash. |
| **Floor requirements** | The floor behind and beneath the washing machine should be waterproofed as part of the general laundry floor waterproofing (see B1). Washing machine overflows and hose failures are a major cause of insurance claims. |
| **Penetration sealing** | Hot and cold water supply tap penetrations through the wall behind the washing machine must be sealed in the same manner as bathroom pipe penetrations (see A17). The waste pipe penetration (if through the wall or floor) must also be sealed. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** as part of the overall laundry waterproofing scope. The wall area behind the washing machine should be explicitly addressed in the scope of works. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing the wall behind the washing machine — tap failures and hose bursts are a leading cause of insurance claims. (2) Not sealing the tap penetrations through the wall. (3) Using standard plasterboard behind the washing machine — MR plasterboard or fibre cement should be used. |

### B3. Laundry Tub Area

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of the area around the laundry tub (laundry basin/sink). Similar in principle to the bathroom vanity area — the tub is a water fixture that requires appropriate waterproofing of surrounding surfaces. |
| **Wall requirements** | Walls adjacent to the laundry tub must be **water-resistant** to a height of not less than **150mm above the top of the tub**, for the extent of the tub, where the tub is within 75mm of a wall. This is the same requirement as for baths (see A11). Splash-back areas above the tub should be tiled or otherwise water-resistant. |
| **Floor requirements** | The floor beneath and around the laundry tub is waterproofed as part of the general laundry floor waterproofing. |
| **Penetration sealing** | Hot and cold water supply and waste pipe penetrations at the laundry tub must be sealed. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** as part of the overall laundry waterproofing scope. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing the wall to the required height behind the laundry tub. (2) Not sealing pipe penetrations at the tub location. (3) Using a non-water-resistant wall lining behind the tub (standard plasterboard). |

## C. Other Areas

### C1. Balcony Waterproofing (External Wet Area)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing of external balconies, decks, and terraces that are above habitable spaces or above ground level. External wet areas are governed by **AS 4654.1:2012 and AS 4654.2:2012** (Waterproofing Membranes for External Above-Ground Use), NOT by AS 3740 (which covers internal wet areas). External waterproofing has significantly more demanding requirements than internal wet areas due to UV exposure, thermal cycling, wind-driven rain, and structural movement. |
| **How requirements differ from internal** | **(1) Membrane thickness:** Minimum 1.2mm DFT for liquid membranes on external areas (vs approximately 1.0mm for internal). **(2) UV stability:** The membrane (or the top coat) must be UV-stable. Internal membranes are not UV-tested. **(3) Membrane turn-up:** Membranes must turn up at walls a minimum of **100mm** and must extend at least **25mm above the finished floor surface at door thresholds**. **(4) Falls:** Minimum 1:100 for surface drainage (shallower than internal wet areas). **(5) Drainage:** At least one primary drain and one overflow outlet required. **(6) Reinforcement:** All joints, corners, and edges must be reinforced with fibre tape or bond breaker. **(7) Substrate:** Must be moisture-resistant — particleboard sheeting is prohibited. **(8) Product classification:** External membranes must be classified under AS 4654.1, not just AS 4858 (which covers internal membranes). |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** for any balcony renovation involving waterproofing (e.g., retiling, membrane replacement). Not applicable to standard internal bathroom renovations — included here for scope completeness where a project includes a balcony. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 4654.1:2012 (membrane materials) and AS 4654.2:2012 (design and installation). NCC 2022. Must be done by a licensed waterproofing contractor. Products must be tested and classified for external use. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using an internal-grade membrane on an external balcony — internal membranes are not UV-stable or rated for external conditions. (2) Insufficient membrane thickness — external areas require thicker DFT than internal. (3) Inadequate falls — ponding water on a balcony accelerates membrane degradation. (4) Not providing an overflow drain — if the primary drain blocks, water builds up and can overflow into the building. (5) Not turning the membrane up sufficiently at the door threshold — the most common point of water entry into the building from a balcony. (6) Using particleboard as the substrate — prohibited by AS 4654.2. |

### C2. Kitchen Waterproofing

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Waterproofing in a kitchen is generally **not required** unless the kitchen has a floor waste. Kitchens are not classified as "wet areas" under AS 3740:2021 in the same way as bathrooms and laundries, because they do not have shower fixtures or baths that produce large volumes of water. |
| **When waterproofing IS required** | **(1)** If the kitchen has a **floor waste** — the floor area around the waste must be waterproofed and graded to the waste. **(2)** If tap and spout penetrations are in **horizontal surfaces** (e.g., a benchtop-mounted mixer penetrating through the benchtop) — these must be waterproofed per AS 3740:2021. **(3)** If the kitchen is on an **upper level above habitable space** and has a floor waste — enhanced waterproofing applies. |
| **When waterproofing is NOT required** | A standard ground-floor kitchen on a concrete slab with no floor waste does not require waterproofing under AS 3740:2021. The splashback area behind the sink is not required to be waterproofed (though it should be water-resistant — tiled or a similar finish). |
| **Standard or optional** | **NOT STANDARD** for typical kitchen renovations. Only required if a floor waste is present or specific penetration conditions apply. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Waterproofing a kitchen floor when it is not required — unnecessary cost. (2) Conversely, not waterproofing when a floor waste is present — code breach. (3) Not making the splashback area water-resistant (tiled or otherwise sealed). |

---

### C3. Upper-Level Bathroom Over Habitable Space

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A bathroom located on an upper level (first floor or above) where the space directly below is a habitable room (bedroom, living room, study, etc.). This is the highest-risk waterproofing scenario in residential construction because any failure results in immediate, visible, and potentially severe damage to the room below — water staining on ceilings, mould growth in wall and ceiling cavities, structural damage to timber framing, and potential ceiling collapse in extreme cases. |
| **Enhanced requirements** | **(1) Full floor waterproofing is mandatory** — the entire bathroom floor must be waterproofed, not just the shower area. This is driven by both AS 3740:2021 (timber floor substrate rule) and the NCC. **(2) The floor substrate is almost always timber-framed** (joists and particleboard/plywood sheet) in Australian residential construction, which triggers the mandatory full-floor waterproofing requirement. **(3) Higher-quality membrane systems may be specified** — many builders and certifiers specify Class III membranes (highest elongation) or combination systems for upper-level bathrooms. **(4) Enhanced junction detailing** — all wall/floor junctions should receive additional reinforcement. **(5) Some builders specify a secondary drainage layer or tray** beneath the waterproofing as an additional safeguard (though this is not mandated by the standard). |
| **Inspection and certification** | Upper-level bathroom waterproofing should receive the most rigorous inspection. In Victoria, the mandatory pre-tiling inspection by a building surveyor is especially critical for upper-level bathrooms. A comprehensive compliance certificate with photographs is essential. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — full floor waterproofing is mandatory. Enhanced detailing is best practice and increasingly expected by certifiers. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Treating an upper-level bathroom the same as a ground-floor bathroom — the risk profile is completely different. (2) Not waterproofing the full floor — a code breach when the substrate is timber. (3) Not using a membrane with adequate elongation/crack bridging for the structural movement typical of timber-framed floors. (4) Not photographing the completed membrane before tiling — critical for future dispute resolution. (5) Inadequate junction treatment — timber floors move more than concrete slabs, putting greater stress on wall/floor junctions. |

### D2. AS 4858 Membrane Classification Summary

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Class | Elongation at Break | Typical Use | Crack Bridging Ability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Class I** | 0-59% | Rigid membranes; limited movement capability | Minimal — suitable only for stable substrates with no expected movement |
| **Class II** | 60-299% | Moderate flexibility; suitable for most internal applications | Moderate — can bridge minor hairline cracks |
| **Class III** | 300%+ (typically 600-700%+) | High flexibility; suitable for all internal and most external applications | High — can bridge significant cracks and accommodate structural movement |

> **Note:** For residential bathroom renovations, **Class III membranes are the standard choice** in Australia. They provide the elongation needed to accommodate building movement, thermal expansion, and shrinkage cracking. All major products listed in Table D1 are Class III. Using a Class I or II membrane in a bathroom is rare and would typically only occur for specialised applications.
