## 1. AS 3740 — Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas

**Confidence: HIGH** — Based on AS 3740:2021 (current edition), NCC 2022 references, and multiple industry/government sources.

### 1.1 Scope and Application

AS 3740:2021 is the primary Australian Standard governing waterproofing of domestic wet areas. It sets out minimum requirements for the **materials, design, and installation** of waterproofing in residential buildings.

The standard applies to:
- **Class 1 buildings** (detached houses, townhouses) — the primary target for ScopeAI
- **Class 2 buildings** (apartments, units)
- **Class 4 buildings** (dwellings within commercial buildings)
- Wet areas within Class 3-9 buildings (as if a Class 2/4 part of the building)

AS 3740:2021 replaced AS 3740:2010 (Amdt 1 2012) and introduced several important changes including stricter requirements for shower proximity to doorways, door frame protection, prohibition of particleboard substrates, and membrane grading requirements.

### 1.2 Wet Area Risk Categories

AS 3740:2021 classifies wet areas into three risk categories, which determine the level of waterproofing required:

| Category | Risk Level | Areas Included |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Category 1** | High | Enclosed shower areas; unenclosed shower areas; baths with unenclosed showers over them; any area within reach of a hand-held shower fitting; water closets with a hand-held douche/bidet spray; douche rooms |
| **Category 2** | Moderate | Bathroom areas outside an unenclosed shower area; bathroom areas outside an unenclosed shower over a bath |
| **Category 3** | Low | Any wet area without a shower (e.g. laundry without shower, toilet without bidet spray) |

**Key principle:** Higher risk = more stringent waterproofing requirements. Category 1 areas require full waterproof membranes. Category 3 areas may only require water-resistant treatment (depending on whether a floor waste is present).

### 1.3 Areas That Must Be Waterproofed

The following areas require waterproofing treatment under AS 3740:2021:

#### Mandatory Waterproof (impervious membrane required)

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Shower floor (enclosed) | Entire floor area within the shower must be waterproofed |
| Shower floor (unenclosed) | Floor area within a 1500 mm horizontal radius from the shower rose connection point must be waterproofed |
| Shower walls | Walls within the shower area must be waterproofed to minimum heights (see Section 1.4) |
| Bathroom floor (with floor waste) | Entire floor must be waterproofed |
| Bathroom floor (timber/particleboard substrate or upper storey) | Entire floor must be waterproofed |
| Laundry floor (with floor waste) | Floor, wall/floor junctions, and penetrations must be waterproofed |
| Above baths (with shower over) | Treated the same as a shower area — full waterproofing to shower heights |
| All wall/floor junctions in wet areas with floor waste | Must be waterproofed |
| All penetrations through waterproofed areas | Must be sealed waterproof (pipes, drains, floor wastes) |

#### Water-Resistant Only (where no floor waste exists)

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Laundry floor (without floor waste, no bidet spray) | Floor and wall/floor junctions must be water-resistant |
| Bathroom floor (ground floor, concrete slab, no timber) | Water-resistant treatment acceptable for areas outside the shower |
| Walls adjacent to fixtures | Water-resistant to specified heights |

**Important distinction:** "Waterproof" means an impervious membrane that prevents any water passage. "Water-resistant" means the surface can resist moisture penetration under normal conditions but is not a sealed membrane.

### 1.4 Minimum Height Requirements

This is one of the most critical sections for scope generation. Heights are measured from the **finished floor level (FFL)**.

| Location | Minimum Waterproofing Height | Notes |
|----------|------------------------------|-------|
| **Shower walls (enclosed or unenclosed)** | **1800 mm above FFL** OR **50 mm above the shower rose**, whichever is higher | The entire wall lining within the shower area must be waterproofed to this height. Industry best practice is often to waterproof to full ceiling height |
| **Shower over bath — walls** | **1800 mm above FFL** OR **50 mm above the shower rose**, whichever is higher | Same as standalone shower. Classified as Category 1 high risk |
| **Unenclosed shower — walls within 1500 mm radius** | **1800 mm above FFL** | Any wall that falls within the 1500 mm horizontal radius from the shower rose must be waterproofed to 1800 mm |
| **Bath (no shower over it) — adjacent walls** | **150 mm above the rim** of the bath, for the extent of the bath, where the bath is within 75 mm of a wall | Only applicable where the bath abuts or is close to a wall |
| **General bathroom walls (outside shower)** | **150 mm above FFL** | Minimum water-resistant or waterproof treatment at the wall/floor junction |
| **Walls adjacent to basin/vanity** | **150 mm above the fixture rim**, for the extent of the fixture, where fixture is within 75 mm of the wall | Applies to any vessel (basin, sink, tub) near a wall |
| **Laundry — walls adjacent to tub/sink** | **150 mm above the fixture rim**, for the extent of the fixture, where fixture is within 75 mm of the wall | Same rule as bathroom fixtures |
| **Laundry — general walls** | **150 mm above FFL** (where floor waste present) | Water-resistant minimum at wall/floor junction |

**ScopeAI note:** For renovation scopes, the AI should default to recommending **1800 mm** for all shower walls and **full ceiling height** as best practice (many certifiers and builders now prefer this). The 150 mm minimum for general bathroom walls should be stated but noted as a minimum — most renovations waterproof the full wet area floor and all junctions regardless.

### 1.5 Floor Requirements and Gradients

#### Floor Waste Requirements

- Every shower area **must** have a floor waste
- Bathrooms with a shower **must** have at least one floor waste
- Laundries may or may not have a floor waste (this affects whether waterproof vs water-resistant treatment is required)

#### Fall-to-Waste Gradients

| Measurement | Requirement |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Minimum fall** | 1:80 (12.5 mm per metre) |
| **Maximum fall** | 1:50 (20 mm per metre) |
| **Recommended range (best practice)** | 1:60 to 1:80 |
| **Fall direction** | Continuous fall toward the floor waste — no ponding |

**AS 3740:2021 new requirement:** Where the surface finish (e.g. tiles) is required to drain to a floor waste, the **waterproof membrane itself** must also be graded to fall toward the waste. This is a significant change from previous editions.

**NCC Volume Two exception:** For residential buildings (Class 1, Volume Two), builders may opt to follow Section 10.2 of the Housing Provisions instead of AS 3740:2021, which does not mandate graded membranes. However, in multi-unit/commercial (NCC Volume One), graded membranes are mandatory.

**Practical test:** A ping-pong ball placed on the finished floor should roll toward the drain.

### 1.6 Step-Down, Hob and Waterstop Requirements

AS 3740:2021 introduced stricter requirements where shower areas are near doorways.

#### Clause 4.8.5 — Shower Near Exit (within 200 mm)

Where the extremity of a shower area is located **within 200 mm** of an exit from a wet area, **all three** of the following are required:

**(A)** The shower must be an **enclosed shower area** (i.e. with a shower screen/door)

**(B)** One of the following water containment methods:
| Option | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| Waterstop under shower screen | Must finish minimum **5 mm above FFL** |
| Hob at shower extremity | A raised lip/kerb at the edge of the shower area |
| Step-down | Minimum **15 mm step-down** from FFL at the extremity of the shower area |

**(C)** A **vertical waterstop** where the shower screen abuts the wall

#### General Wet Area Doorway Requirements

For the wet area doorway itself (bathroom door threshold):
- The traditional requirement for a hob/lip at bathroom doorways has been relaxed in recent editions
- A **set-down in the screed** (creating a level difference) is an acceptable alternative to a raised hob
- The key requirement is to **prevent water escaping the wet area** into adjacent dry areas
- Waterproof membrane must extend under any door tracks or thresholds

#### Waterstop at Unenclosed Showers

- For unenclosed showers (no screen), a waterstop must be installed at 1500 mm horizontal radius from the shower rose
- The waterstop must be **flush with the finished floor level** at the perimeter
- The waterproof membrane must terminate at and bond to the waterstop to ensure membrane continuity

### 1.7 Junction and Penetration Details

Junctions and penetrations are the most common points of waterproofing failure. AS 3740:2021 requires meticulous treatment at every interface.

#### Floor-to-Wall Junctions

- Must have a **fillet/bond breaker** applied before the membrane
- Fillet sealant (typically neutral cure silicone) applied at the internal angle
- Membrane must be continuous across the junction — no breaks or terminations
- The membrane must turn up the wall to the required height

#### Wall-to-Wall Corners (Internal)

- Bond breaker required at all internal wall corners
- Membrane must be continuous through the corner
- Reinforcing tape/fabric may be used for additional protection

#### Pipe Penetrations

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Leak control flanges** | Must be installed on all pipe risers penetrating the waterproof membrane |
| **Flange positioning** | Must be **recessed into the substrate** — must NOT protrude above the substrate surface |
| **Flange sizing** | Diameter of the leak control flange (DN) must match the diameter of the riser pipe (DN) |
| **Sealing** | Flange must be sealed to the riser pipe and secured to the substrate to prevent movement |
| **Fillet sealant** | Applied at the transition from leak control flange to substrate |
| **Membrane termination** | The membrane must terminate at or in the leak control flange to form a waterproof connection |

#### Floor Waste / Drainage Flanges

- A **drainage flange (puddle flange)** must be installed into the slab, regardless of the waterproofing method
- The waterproof membrane must terminate at or within the drainage flange
- The flange provides a waterproof connection between membrane and drain body
- Must be clamped/sealed to create a continuous waterproof barrier

### 1.8 Bond Breaker Requirements

Bond breakers accommodate building movement at junctions without tearing the membrane. They are **mandatory** at all critical junctions.

#### Where Bond Breakers Are Required

- All **wall/floor junctions**
- All **wall/wall (internal corner) junctions**
- All **hob/wall junctions**
- All **movement joints** within the waterproofed area

#### Bond Breaker Materials

| Material | Application |
|----------|------------|
| **Neutral cure silicone** | Most common — used as a fillet at wall/floor junctions |
| **Non-paintable polyurethane sealant** | Alternative bond breaker material |
| **Vinyl tape** | Used in some systems as a debonding strip |

#### Bond Breaker Sizing (AS 3740:2021 Table 4.10)

| Membrane Class | Minimum Fillet/Bond Breaker Size |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Class III** (highest flexibility) | 12 mm |
| **Class II** (moderate flexibility) | 35 mm |

The bond breaker must be **compatible with the flexibility class** of the membrane being used. Using an incompatible bond breaker can lead to membrane failure at junctions.

### 1.9 Approved Membrane Types

AS 3740:2021 does not prescribe specific brands but specifies performance requirements for membrane materials. All membranes must comply with the relevant Australian Standards for the membrane type.

#### Membrane Categories

| Type | Description | Common Use | Relevant Standard |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Liquid-applied membranes** | Brush, roller, or spray applied. Cure to form a flexible film | Most common for domestic wet areas (showers, bathroom floors) | AS/NZS 4858 |
| **Sheet membranes** | Pre-formed flexible sheets bonded to substrate | Under-tile applications, large floor areas | AS/NZS 4858 |
| **Cementitious membranes** | Cement-based coatings mixed with acrylic polymers | External applications, concrete substrates | Manufacturer specs |
| **Polyurethane membranes** | Two-part or single-part polyurethane coatings | Balconies, external wet areas, high-movement areas | Manufacturer specs |

#### Membrane Classification (AS/NZS 4858)

Membranes are classified by flexibility:

| Class | Flexibility | Typical Application |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **Class I** | Lowest flexibility | Limited to substrates with minimal movement (e.g. concrete slab on ground) |
| **Class II** | Moderate flexibility | General domestic use — concrete and masonry substrates |
| **Class III** | Highest flexibility | Required where significant movement is expected — timber floors, upper storeys, junctions |

**Key requirement:** All components in the waterproofing system must be **compatible** — the membrane, primer, sealant, bond breaker, and substrate must all work together. Mixing incompatible products from different manufacturers is a common cause of failure.

#### Application Requirements

- Applied in **multiple thin coats** (not one thick coat) to avoid pinholing
- Coats applied in **alternating directions** (cross-hatched) to seal small gaps
- **Visual inspection** of the membrane is required before any finish (tiles) is installed
- Inspection must check: pinholes, dry film thickness, fillet adequacy, bond quality, transition integrity, vertical termination heights, waterstop locations

### 1.10 Door Frame and Architrave Protection

AS 3740:2021 Clause 4.9.2 introduced specific requirements:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Timber door frames | Must **NOT** be embedded into tiles |
| Gap between architrave and floor | Minimum **2 mm sealed gap** between the bottom of the door architrave and the finished floor |
| Underside treatment | The underside of the door jamb and architrave must be **treated to resist moisture** |
| Door jamb/architrave position | Must NOT extend below the level of the tiles |

These requirements prevent moisture wicking up through timber door frames — a common cause of concealed rot and mould.

### 1.11 Substrate Requirements

AS 3740:2021 specifies what surfaces the membrane can be applied to:

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Particleboard** | **PROHIBITED** — particleboard sheeting can no longer be used as a substrate for waterproofing layers (new in 2021 edition) |
| **Surface condition** | Must be smooth, without protrusions, voids, or formwork distortions |
| **Cleanliness** | Must be clean, dry, and free from dust before membrane application |
| **Moisture content** | Must be measured prior to application — substrate must be within acceptable moisture limits |
| **Priming** | Substrate may need priming as per membrane manufacturer's instructions |

### 2.6 WA — Western Australia

**Regulator:** Department of Commerce (Building Commission)

#### Licensing
- A licence is required for waterproofing work valued at more than **$20,000** (incl. GST) — the **highest threshold** of any state
- This higher threshold means some smaller bathroom renovations may not technically require a licensed waterproofer (though using one is strongly recommended)
- Building Services Registration required for practitioners

### 2.7 TAS — Tasmania

**Regulator:** WorkSafe Tasmania

#### Licensing
- Construction waterproofing trade licence required
- CPC31420 Certificate III in Construction Waterproofing is the base qualification

- CPC31420 Certificate III in Construction Waterproofing required

### 2.10 Photographic Evidence Requirements

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — Requirements vary by state and certifier. No single national standard mandates specific photographic documentation, but industry practice is strong.

#### Industry Best Practice (All States)

Photographic evidence should be taken at the following stages:

| Stage | What to Photograph | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| **1. Substrate preparation** | Clean substrate before membrane application | Proves substrate was properly prepared |
| **2. First coat application** | Membrane first coat coverage | Proves proper application technique |
| **3. Second/final coat** | Complete membrane coverage including all junctions, penetrations, and turns | Proves full coverage before tiling conceals the membrane |
| **4. Junction details** | Close-ups of wall/floor junctions, corners, pipe penetrations, floor waste flanges | These are the most common failure points |
| **5. Heights** | Tape measure against walls showing membrane height relative to FFL | Proves compliance with height requirements |
| **6. Bond breakers/fillets** | Silicone fillets at all junctions before membrane | Proves bond breakers were installed |

#### State-Specific Requirements

- **NSW:** Photographic evidence is part of standard compliance documentation, particularly important for strata renovations where the owners corporation requires records
- **VIC:** The VBA recommends photographic records as part of the compliance process; with the upcoming mandatory inspection stages (2026), photographic documentation will become more formally important
- **QLD:** QBCC expects documentation to support Form 43 certification; photographs are standard industry practice though not explicitly legislated in the form
- **All states:** Where a Building Certifier is involved, they may request photographic evidence before signing off — even in states without a formal requirement

**ScopeAI note:** The scope-of-works should always include a line item for "Photographic documentation of waterproofing at all stages prior to tiling" as this protects the homeowner's insurance position and provides evidence for warranty claims.

---

## 3. NCC/BCA Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH** — Based on NCC 2022 published provisions and ABCB consultation documents for NCC 2025.

### 3.1 NCC 2022 — Current Requirements

The National Construction Code (NCC) 2022 is the current edition adopted across most states. Waterproofing requirements appear in two volumes:

#### Volume Two (Housing Provisions) — Class 1 and 10 Buildings

**Part 10.2 — Wet Area Waterproofing** is the primary section. Key provisions:

| NCC Clause | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| 10.2.2(a) | Shower floor must be waterproofed |
| 10.2.3 | Bathroom floor outside shower — compliance requirements |
| 10.2.7–10.2.32 | Prescriptive (Deemed-to-Satisfy) provisions for waterproofing |
| 10.2.12 | Specific requirements when using AS 3740 as the compliance pathway |
| H4D3 | Class 1 buildings — references Housing Provisions Standard 2022 |

**Compliance pathways (Class 1 residential):**

Builders can comply with waterproofing requirements via:
1. **AS 3740:2021** plus NCC clause 10.2.12 requirements (including graded membrane requirements)
2. **NCC clauses 10.2.7 to 10.2.32** directly (Deemed-to-Satisfy provisions, which do NOT require graded membranes)

This dual pathway is important — renovations may encounter different approaches depending on the builder's chosen compliance path.

#### Volume One — Class 2-9 Buildings

**Part F (Health and Amenity) — Specification 26** governs waterproofing for multi-unit residential and commercial:
- References AS 3740 for wet area waterproofing
- Additional requirements for balconies (AS 4654.2)
- No option to avoid graded membrane requirement

#### Additional NCC Requirements Beyond AS 3740

| Area | Additional NCC Requirement |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Timber floors** | Must be waterproofed if located in a wet area — NCC requires entire floor waterproofing for timber/particleboard substrates |
| **Upper storey wet areas** | Additional protection required to prevent water damage to structure and spaces below |
| **Accessibility** | AS 1428.1 requirements for accessible bathrooms may affect waterproofing layout (e.g. hobless showers) |
| **Ventilation** | AS 1668.2 or NCC Part 10.4 ventilation requirements work alongside waterproofing to manage moisture |
| **Structural adequacy** | Floor must support the waterproofing system and finished surface without excessive deflection |

### 3.2 NCC 2025 — Upcoming Changes

**Confidence: MEDIUM** — NCC 2025 has been published as a preview draft (Feb 2026). State adoption varies. Changes may be modified before final adoption.

#### Key Waterproofing Changes in NCC 2025

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Merged Part F1** | Part F1 (surface water, rising damp, external waterproofing) and Part F3 (roof/wall cladding) merged into a single Part F1 |
| **Consolidated Performance Requirements** | Multiple existing Performance Requirements consolidated into two: F1P1 and F1P2 |
| **Sub-surface water management** | New provisions addressing sub-surface water — resolving a gap in NCC 2022 |
| **Class 7-8 buildings** | Waterproofing provisions now apply to storage and factory buildings (previously limited) |
| **10-year deflection** | New provision in Part B1 (B1D3) for 10-year deflection in structural design |
| **Enhanced balcony provisions** | Specific waterproofing requirements for balconies of apartment buildings |

#### State Adoption Timeline

| State/Territory | Expected NCC 2025 Adoption |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **All jurisdictions** | Can consider adoption from **1 May 2026** |
| **ACT** | 6-month transition period (May–Nov 2026) |
| **Tasmania** | Paused implementation of NCC 2025 |
| **Other states** | TBD — some may delay (as happened with NCC 2022) |

**Residential pause:** Ministers agreed to pause NCC residential changes (excluding urgent safety items) until **mid-2029**. This means the enhanced waterproofing provisions may primarily affect commercial/multi-unit first.

#### Projected Impact

ABCB cost-benefit analysis found:
- Net benefits of **$1 billion** for Class 2 buildings
- Net benefits of **$2.7 billion** for Class 3-9 buildings
- Primary savings through avoiding costly remediation work

## 4. Warranty Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH** — Based on multiple industry sources and state legislation.

### 4.1 Manufacturer Warranties

Manufacturer warranties cover **defects in the waterproofing materials** themselves.

| Duration | Coverage | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **10 years** | Standard for most quality membrane brands | Most common duration |
| **20 years** | Premium products from major manufacturers | Requires approved applicator in many cases |
| **25–30 years** | Top-tier products (e.g. some ARDEX, Sika products) | Often requires full system use (same brand primer, membrane, sealant) |

**Conditions that may void manufacturer warranties:**
- Products not applied according to manufacturer specifications
- Incompatible products from different manufacturers used together
- Substrate not properly prepared
- Applied in unsuitable weather conditions (temperature, humidity)
- Product stored or handled incorrectly

### 4.2 Installer/Workmanship Warranties

Installer warranties cover **the quality of application and installation**.

| Duration | Coverage | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **1–2 years** | Basic contractor guarantee on workmanship | Minimum common in the industry |
| **5 years** | Mid-range — common for established companies | Often described as "standard" |
| **6 years** | Quality-focused installers | Matches NSW statutory defect period |
| **7 years** | Premium installers (e.g. Blutec Waterproofing) | Among the best in the market |
| **Lifetime** | Extremely rare — usually requires ongoing maintenance contract | Offered by very few companies |

**ScopeAI note:** The scope should recommend requesting **both** a manufacturer product warranty AND an installer workmanship warranty. A 10-year product warranty with a 5+ year workmanship warranty represents good value protection.

### 4.3 Statutory Warranties by State

These are **legally mandated minimum warranty periods** that apply regardless of what the contractor offers:

| State | Major Defect Period | Minor Defect Period | Notes |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| **NSW** | **6 years** | **2 years** | Home Building Act 1989. Waterproofing failure is typically classified as a major defect |
| **VIC** | **10 years** | **6 years** | Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995. Builder liability extends to 10 years for major structural/waterproofing work |
| **QLD** | **6 years, 6 months** | **6 years, 6 months** | QBCC Act. Single defect period applies |
| **SA** | **5 years** | **5 years** | Building Work Contractors Act 1995 |
| **WA** | **6 years** | **6 years** | Home Building Contracts Act 1991 |
| **TAS** | **6 years** | **6 years** | Residential Building Work Contracts and Dispute Resolution Act 2016 |
| **ACT** | **6 years** | **6 years** | Building Act 2004 |
| **NT** | **6 years** | **6 years** | Building Act 1993 |

**Key point:** Waterproofing failure is almost always classified as a **major defect** because it affects the structural integrity and habitability of the building. This means the longer warranty period applies in states with tiered systems (NSW, VIC).

## 5. Insurance Implications

**Confidence: HIGH** — Based on industry sources, insurance comparison sites, and building inspection reports.

### 5.1 What Insurance Covers

Home and contents insurance **typically covers** water damage from:
- Sudden, unforeseen events (burst pipes, storm damage, flood)
- Accidental damage leading to water ingress
- Secondary damage (mould, timber rot) resulting from a covered sudden event

### 5.2 What Insurance Does NOT Cover

Home insurance **typically excludes:**

| Exclusion | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Gradual waterproofing failure** | Slow deterioration of a membrane over time is considered maintenance, not an insurable event |
| **Recurring leaks** | Damage that occurs "whenever it rains" due to poor waterproofing is excluded |
| **Pre-existing defects** | Waterproofing problems that existed before the policy was taken out |
| **Lack of maintenance** | Failure to maintain the waterproofing system (e.g. cracked grout not resealed) |
| **Non-compliant work** | Work that did not meet AS 3740 or was performed by unlicensed contractors |
| **The waterproofing membrane itself** | Insurance covers the consequential damage (mould, structural damage) but rarely the cost of replacing the membrane |

### 5.3 Non-Certified Waterproofing and Insurance

This is a critical issue for homeowners:

**If waterproofing work has no compliance certificate:**
- Insurance claims for water damage **may be denied**
- The insurer can argue the damage was caused by non-compliant work (a maintenance/negligence exclusion)
- Real-world cases exist where insurers have refused to pay because waterproofing was not compliant with Australian Standards

**Consequences of non-compliant waterproofing:**
| Consequence | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Insurance claim rejection** | Most common outcome — claims denied if no valid certificate |
| **Mandatory rework** | If discovered during renovation or sale, non-compliant waterproofing must be redone at homeowner's expense |
| **Failed inspections** | Building certifier will not sign off, delaying or blocking renovation |
| **Fines and legal notices** | Particularly in NSW where waterproofing certification is mandatory |
| **Reduced property value** | Missing certificates complicate property sales, especially in strata |
| **Strata liability** | In apartments, waterproofing failure affecting common property can expose the lot owner to significant costs |

**ScopeAI note:** The scope-of-works should prominently state:
1. All waterproofing must be performed by a licensed waterproofer
2. A Certificate of Waterproofing Compliance must be obtained
3. Photographic evidence must be documented before tiling
4. Both product and workmanship warranties should be provided
5. The homeowner should retain all certificates for insurance and resale purposes

---

## 6. Key Takeaways for Scope Generation

These are the critical facts the AI must incorporate when generating waterproofing scope-of-works items:

### Mandatory Inclusions in Every Waterproofing Scope

1. **Licensed waterproofer** — must hold CPC31420 (or equivalent) and state licence
2. **Compliance with AS 3740:2021** — reference the standard explicitly
3. **Shower walls to 1800 mm minimum** (or 50 mm above shower rose, whichever is higher) — best practice recommends full ceiling height
4. **Full floor waterproofing** in any room with a shower and floor waste
5. **Fall to waste: 1:80 minimum, 1:50 maximum** — continuous fall, no ponding
6. **Bond breakers at all junctions** — wall/floor, wall/wall, hob/wall
7. **Leak control flanges on all pipe penetrations** — recessed into substrate
8. **Puddle flange on floor waste** — membrane terminated at/in the flange
9. **Multi-coat application** in alternating directions
10. **Visual inspection before tiling** — documented with photographs
11. **Certificate of Waterproofing Compliance** — issued by the licensed waterproofer
12. **No particleboard substrates** — prohibited under AS 3740:2021
13. **Door frame protection** — 2 mm gap, moisture treatment on underside, not embedded in tiles
14. **Step-down/hob/waterstop** where shower is within 200 mm of room exit

### State-Specific Reminders

| State | Key Reminder |
|-------|-------------|
| **NSW** | Certificate mandatory. Penalties up to $22k/$110k for unlicensed work |
| **VIC** | Mandatory inspection stages coming July 2026. Builder retains primary liability |
| **QLD** | Lowest threshold ($3,300). Form 43 required. QBCC licence mandatory |
| **WA** | Highest threshold ($20,000) but licensed work still strongly recommended |
| **All** | Statutory warranty covers waterproofing as a major defect (6–10 years depending on state) |

### Common Failure Points to Highlight in Scope

The scope should include specific attention to:
- Shower floor-to-wall junctions (the number one failure point)
- Pipe penetrations through the membrane
- Floor waste connections
- Shower screen fixings through the membrane
- Door threshold transitions
- Internal corners

### Cost Context

- Waterproofing failure remediation typically costs **$10,000–$50,000+**
- Getting it right the first time (proper materials, licensed applicator, certification) adds perhaps **$1,000–$3,000** to the renovation cost
- The ROI on compliant waterproofing is enormous — it protects the structure, insurance coverage, property value, and prevents costly litigation
