## A. Kitchen Strip-Out

### A1. Cabinet Removal (Base, Overhead, Pantry, Island)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of all fixed cabinetry including base cabinets, overhead/wall cabinets, pantry units, island cabinetry, and any integrated shelving. Includes removal of all hardware, brackets, and wall fixings. |
| **Typical method** | Disconnect any plumbing or electrical services running through cabinets first. Remove doors and drawers to reduce weight. Unscrew cabinets from wall studs and each other (typically screwed through side panels). Base cabinets are unscrewed from the wall and lifted out; overhead cabinets require two people or temporary support during unfastening. Island units may be bolted to the slab and require bolt extraction. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every kitchen strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Check for live electrical (power points, under-cabinet lighting) before removal. Electrician must isolate circuits. Cabinets may conceal asbestos-containing wall linings in pre-1990 homes. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, safety glasses, dust mask). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Kickboard/plinth removal and disposal. Adhesive residue or bracket holes left in walls needing patching. Cabinets concealing damaged plaster or fibro sheeting behind them. End panels glued to walls. Island plumbing/electrical rough-ins that need capping. |

---

### A2. Benchtop Removal (Laminate vs Stone)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of the benchtop surface from base cabinets. Laminate and stone benchtops have fundamentally different removal methods and costs. |
| **Typical method -- Laminate** | Laminate tops are lightweight (typically postformed with particleboard substrate). Unscrew from underneath through cabinet corner brackets. Disconnect sink and cooktop cutouts. Lift off in sections. Usually a 1-2 person job. |
| **Typical method -- Stone** | Stone benchtops (engineered quartz, granite, marble) are extremely heavy (40-80+ kg per linear metre). Require minimum 2-3 people. Often siliconed/epoxied to cabinets. May need to be broken in place with a sledgehammer or cut with a diamond blade if too heavy or large to remove whole. Stone dust is a silica hazard. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- but the method and cost differ significantly by material. Stone removal costs approximately $350-$800 for demolition and disposal versus $100-$250 for laminate. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Stone removal generates crystalline silica dust -- respiratory protection (P2 mask minimum) required. Stone cutting must comply with WHS crystalline silica exposure standards. Heavy lifting risk assessment needed. Disconnect all services (sink plumbing, cooktop gas/electric) before removal. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Weight of stone benchtops (often underestimated, leading to manual handling injuries). Silicone adhesive residue on cabinets and walls. Undermount sink clips embedded in stone. Benchtop support brackets left in walls. Integrated stone splashback that comes with the benchtop. |

---

### A3. Splashback Removal (Tiles, Glass, Stone)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of the wall covering between the benchtop and overhead cabinets, and sometimes full-height behind cooktops. Material type determines method and substrate damage. |
| **Typical method -- Tiles** | Use a cold chisel and hammer or electric tile scraper/jackhammer with chisel bit. Work from top to bottom. Tiles on plasterboard will almost always damage the paper face of the board, requiring skim-coating or full sheet replacement. Tiles on cement sheet or brick substrate are easier to remove with less substrate damage. |
| **Typical method -- Glass** | Glass splashbacks are adhered with silicone or construction adhesive. Score silicone edges with a utility knife, then use a putty knife or oscillating tool to work behind the panel. Glass panels can shatter -- cover with contact film before removal. Often requires full plasterboard replacement behind. |
| **Typical method -- Stone** | Stone splashbacks (usually 20mm thick slabs) are heavy and adhered with silicone or epoxy. Similar to glass but heavier. May need to be broken in place if too large. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in kitchen strip-out unless new splashback can overlay existing (rare in renovations). |
| **Safety/compliance** | Isolate electrical power points behind splashback before any removal (electrician required). Glass removal requires cut-resistant gloves and eye protection. Asbestos-containing fibro may be present behind tiles in pre-1990 homes -- test before removal. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Substrate damage behind tiles (plasterboard almost always needs replacement or skimming). Power points and light switches concealed behind splashback material that need to be re-mounted. Glass splashback removal often destroys the wall behind it entirely. Cost of wall repair/replacement after splashback removal. |

---

### A4. Flooring Removal (Vinyl, Tiles -- by Layer)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of kitchen floor covering down to structural substrate (concrete slab or timber subfloor). Kitchens commonly have multiple layers of flooring built up over decades. |
| **Typical method -- Vinyl** | Cut vinyl into strips with a utility knife. Peel up using a floor scraper or ride-on stripping machine for large areas. Heat gun can soften adhesive. Scrape adhesive residue from substrate. Multiple layers of vinyl are common in older homes (each layer may have different adhesive). |
| **Typical method -- Tiles** | Use an electric jackhammer with chisel attachment or ride-on tile removal machine. Tiles on screed require removal of both tile and screed layer. Tiles glued directly to slab require grinding of adhesive residue. Tiles on timber subfloor may damage the subfloor -- assess replacement needs. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- but depth of removal is conditional. Full removal down to slab is standard for tiled finishes. Overlay-compatible floors may only need surface preparation. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **CRITICAL: Vinyl flooring and vinyl tile adhesive in pre-1990 homes frequently contains asbestos.** Must be tested before removal. If positive, licensed asbestos removalist required (Class B licence for >10m2 of non-friable asbestos). Tile removal generates significant dust -- use HEPA-filtered dust extraction. Silica dust from adhesive grinding requires respiratory protection. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Multiple layers of flooring (common to find 2-3 layers in older kitchens). Asbestos in vinyl and black adhesive (bituminous mastic). Uneven slab surface after tile/screed removal requiring levelling compound. Tile removal often reveals the kitchen was smaller originally (different slab levels or finishes). Floor height changes affecting door clearances and transitions to adjacent rooms. |

---

### A5. Appliance Disconnection and Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Disconnection and physical removal of all kitchen appliances including oven, cooktop (gas or electric), rangehood, dishwasher, microwave (if built-in), and refrigerator. |
| **Typical method** | Each appliance type requires a different licensed trade for disconnection. Physical removal is then done by demolition crew. Appliances are either taken to tip or set aside for client/charity. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- all appliances must be disconnected and removed in a full kitchen strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **Gas cooktop/oven:** Must be disconnected by a licensed gasfitter (or plumber with gasfitting endorsement). Gas must be isolated and capped at the bayonet or supply point. A compliance certificate may be required. **Electrical appliances (oven, rangehood, dishwasher):** Must be disconnected by a licensed electrician. Hard-wired appliances (ovens, rangehoods) require isolation at the switchboard and disconnection at the junction box. **Plumbed appliances (dishwasher):** Water supply valve must be turned off and hoses disconnected. A plumber is technically required to cap any exposed pipework. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Rangehood ducting removal (often runs through ceiling cavity or external wall). Gas bayonet capping after cooktop removal. Dedicated electrical circuits that need to be isolated (not just the appliance -- the circuit at the board). Dishwasher drain connection into sink waste. Microwave trim kits and mounting brackets. Refrigerator water line (for ice maker) requiring plumber to cap. |

---

### A6. Sink and Tapware Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of kitchen sink (undermount, top-mount, or butler sink), mixer tap or tap set, and associated plumbing connections (water supply, waste trap, and drain connection). |
| **Typical method** | Turn off hot and cold water isolation valves under sink. Disconnect flexible hose connectors from isolation valves. Disconnect waste trap from drain pipe. Remove tap from sink or benchtop. Remove sink from benchtop (unclip undermount brackets or lift out top-mount). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every kitchen strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | A licensed plumber must cap any exposed pipework if services are being left for a period before new fit-off. Water mains may need to be shut off if isolation valves are faulty or non-existent (common in older homes). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Corroded or seized isolation valves that break during disconnection (requires plumber to replace at the wall). Waste pipe that runs through the slab needing capping. Insinkerator/waste disposal unit (requires electrical disconnection too). Water filter systems with dedicated tap and supply line. |

---

### A7. Wall Removal (Non-Load-Bearing vs Load-Bearing)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Partial or full removal of internal walls to open up the kitchen to adjoining living/dining areas. The critical distinction is whether the wall is load-bearing or non-load-bearing. |
| **Typical method -- Non-load-bearing** | Remove plasterboard linings, insulation (if any), and timber or steel stud framing. Cut at ceiling and floor lines. Patch ceiling and floor where wall was removed. Typically a straightforward demolition task. |
| **Typical method -- Load-bearing** | **Requires structural engineer assessment and design BEFORE any work.** Engineer determines beam size and material (steel or LVL timber). Temporary propping must be installed on both sides of the wall before any removal. Wall is removed and replaced with an engineered beam (steel UB, RSJ, or LVL) supported on posts/columns per engineer's design. Building approval (CDC or DA) is typically required. Must comply with AS 4100 (Steel Structures) or AS 1720 (Timber Structures). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when scope includes layout changes. Load-bearing removal is a significant cost addition. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **Load-bearing wall removal requires:** (1) Structural engineer's report and design drawings; (2) Building approval/permit from council or private certifier; (3) Temporary propping per engineer's specification; (4) Licensed builder to carry out the work; (5) Inspection by certifier at beam installation stage. Non-load-bearing walls may still contain electrical wiring, plumbing, or gas lines that must be identified and relocated by licensed trades before removal. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Services running through the wall (power, data, plumbing, gas). Ceiling and floor patching/making good after wall removal. Structural engineer's fees ($500-$1,500+ for beam design). Building permit/certification fees. Temporary propping hire costs. Beam installation is a separate trade task (steel fabrication and installation). Cornice and skirting reinstatement. |

---

### A8. Ceiling Removal/Modification (Bulkheads, Soffits)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of ceiling linings, bulkheads (boxed-in sections above cabinets), and soffits that conceal services like ducting, plumbing, and electrical wiring. |
| **Typical method** | Bulkheads: Cut an inspection hole first to identify concealed services (ducting, wiring, plumbing). Remove plasterboard lining, then framing. Ceiling removal: Remove plasterboard sheets or fibrous plaster in sections. Use a reciprocating saw for framing cuts. HEPA-filtered dust extraction recommended. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when the design calls for removal of bulkheads or full ceiling replacement. Bulkhead removal is very common when installing taller overhead cabinets or achieving a more open ceiling. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **CRITICAL: Textured ceilings (popcorn/stipple) in pre-1990 homes may contain asbestos.** Test before any disturbance. Fibrous plaster ceilings (pre-1980) may also contain asbestos. Services concealed in bulkheads and ceiling cavities must be identified before demolition. Electrician must isolate all lighting circuits. Structural integrity of ceiling framing must be assessed -- some bulkheads may be performing a structural function. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Rangehood ducting running through the bulkhead. Electrical wiring for downlights, exhaust fans, and smoke detectors in ceiling. Re-routing of concealed services after bulkhead removal. Cost of new ceiling installation and finishing (plastering, cornice, painting) after removal. Insulation disturbance in ceiling cavity. Smoke detector relocation requirements. |

---

### A9. Service Disconnection (Electrical, Plumbing, Gas)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Safe disconnection of all active services within the kitchen before demolition commences. This is a prerequisite step for all other demolition items. |
| **Typical method** | **Electrical:** Licensed electrician isolates and disconnects circuits at the switchboard. Removes or caps off junction boxes, power points, and hard-wired appliances. **Plumbing:** Licensed plumber isolates and caps water supply (hot and cold) and waste connections. **Gas:** Licensed gasfitter (or plumber with gas endorsement) isolates gas supply, disconnects appliance, and caps the gas line. A pressure test or leak test may be required after capping. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- mandatory first step in every kitchen strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **All service disconnections must be performed by licensed trades -- this is a legal requirement in all Australian states and territories.** Electrical: Licensed electrician (must hold appropriate state licence). Plumbing: Licensed plumber (must hold appropriate state licence). Gas: Licensed gasfitter or plumber with gasfitting endorsement. Compliance certificates may be required for gas work (varies by state). Attempting unlicensed gas or electrical work is illegal and voids home insurance. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Multiple circuits serving the kitchen (lighting, power points, oven, cooktop -- often 3-5 separate circuits). Gas line capping compliance certificate. Water mains isolation if no individual isolation valves exist. Communication/data cabling in kitchen walls. Intercom or security system wiring. Under-floor hydronic heating connections. |

---

### A10. Asbestos-Containing Items Commonly Found in Kitchens

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Identification, testing, and safe removal of asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) commonly present in pre-1990 Australian kitchens. |
| **Common ACM locations in kitchens** | (1) **Vinyl sheet flooring and vinyl floor tiles** -- very common, especially the 9-inch (228mm) tiles with black bituminous adhesive; (2) **Fibro (asbestos cement) wall linings** -- often behind cabinets, under tiles, or as splashback sheeting; (3) **Textured/stippled ceilings** -- the texture compound often contains chrysotile asbestos; (4) **Pipe lagging/insulation** -- around hot water pipes running through wall cavities or under the floor; (5) **Backing board behind ovens and stoves** -- asbestos cement sheets were used as heat-resistant lining; (6) **Window putty** in older timber-framed windows; (7) **Electrical switchboard backing** -- the board behind fuse boxes was commonly asbestos cement. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional but extremely common** -- any home built or renovated before 1990 should be assumed to contain ACMs until proven otherwise by testing. Homes built before 1987 are highest risk. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **Asbestos identification and testing:** Suspect materials must be sampled and tested by a NATA-accredited laboratory before disturbance. **Removal regulations:** Non-friable (bonded) ACMs up to 10m2 can be removed by an unlicensed person following Safe Work Australia guidelines (except in ACT where all removal requires a licence). Over 10m2 requires a Class B licensed removalist. ALL friable asbestos must be removed by a Class A licensed removalist. Removal must follow Safe Work Australia *Code of Practice: How to Safely Remove Asbestos*. Asbestos waste must be disposed of at a licensed facility -- cannot go in general skip bins. **Costs:** Non-friable removal $20-$50/m2; friable removal $100-$150/m2; disposal fee approximately $450 per load; testing $30-$50 per sample. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Multiple layers of vinyl flooring (each layer may contain asbestos). Black bituminous adhesive under vinyl tiles (contains asbestos even if the tiles themselves don't). Fibro sheeting hidden behind later-installed plasterboard. Pipe lagging inside wall cavities only discovered during demolition. Asbestos dust contamination requiring HEPA decontamination of the site. Clearance inspection/air monitoring after friable removal. Neighbour notification requirements for licensed asbestos removal. |

## B. Bathroom Strip-Out

### B1. Tile Removal (Walls and Floor)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Complete removal of wall tiles (typically to 1,800mm+ height in shower areas, sometimes full-height) and floor tiles throughout the bathroom. Includes removal of tile adhesive and levelling compounds. |
| **Typical method** | Use an electric jackhammer/demo hammer with a wide chisel bit to break tiles from the substrate. For walls, work from top to bottom to prevent tiles falling on you. Floor tiles on screed: remove both tile and screed layer using jackhammer. Floor tiles glued to slab: remove tiles then grind adhesive residue with a concrete grinder. Wall tiles on plasterboard: tiles will take the plasterboard face off -- full sheet replacement is almost always required. Wall tiles on cement sheet (Villaboard/Hardiesheet): may survive with minor damage, but often needs replacement for a flat waterproofing substrate. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- full tile removal is included in virtually every bathroom renovation. The decision is whether to remove tiles only OR tiles AND substrate. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Heavy dust generation -- use HEPA dust extraction and P2 respirators. Tile adhesive in pre-1990 homes may contain asbestos -- test before removal. Crystalline silica risk from grinding adhesive on concrete. Eye protection essential (tile fragments are sharp and projectile). Hearing protection for jackhammer use. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Tile adhesive residue on substrate requiring grinding (adds time and cost). Multiple tile layers (common in older bathrooms where tiles were laid over tiles). Niche/recessed shelves tiled into walls that require wall reconstruction. Floor height changes after tile and screed removal affecting door clearance and threshold transitions. Substrate condition -- often worse than expected once tiles are off. |

---

### B2. Waterproofing Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of the existing waterproof membrane from shower floors, shower walls, and the general bathroom floor to allow application of new waterproofing compliant with AS 3740 (Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas). |
| **Typical method** | Old membrane is typically removed as part of the tile and screed removal process. If membrane is applied directly to the slab, it may need to be ground off or chemically stripped. The substrate must be clean, sound, and free of any old membrane for new waterproofing to bond correctly. Any cracks, holes, or damage in the substrate must be repaired before new membrane application. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- old waterproofing MUST be removed when undertaking a full bathroom renovation. New waterproofing cannot reliably bond to old membrane material. AS 3740:2021 requires waterproofing to be applied to a clean, prepared substrate. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Must comply with AS 3740:2021 -- Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas. In QLD and NSW, a licensed waterproofer must apply new membrane and issue a compliance certificate. In other states, a compliance certificate must be provided by the waterproofer. Shower recesses must be waterproofed: floor, walls to minimum 1,800mm height, and hob (if present). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Old membrane remnants preventing proper adhesion of new waterproofing. Substrate repairs needed after membrane removal (cracks, penetrations). The entire wet area floor must be waterproofed (not just the shower). Waterproofing must extend 150mm up walls outside the shower area. Waterproofing compliance certificate is a critical document for building certification and any future warranty claims. |

---

### B3. Fixture Removal (Toilet, Vanity, Bath, Shower Screen)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of all bathroom fixtures including toilet (pan and cistern), vanity (cabinet, basin, and tapware), bathtub (freestanding, built-in, or spa), and shower screen (framed, semi-frameless, or frameless glass). |
| **Typical method** | **Toilet:** Turn off cistern isolation valve, flush to empty, disconnect water supply hose, unbolt pan from floor flange, plug the floor waste to prevent sewer gas. **Vanity:** Disconnect water supply and waste, unscrew from wall, remove. **Bath:** Disconnect waste and overflow, remove bath panel/tiling to access, disconnect any spa jets/pump (electrician for spa pump), lever out of position (cast iron baths are extremely heavy -- 80-150kg). **Shower screen:** Unscrew fixings from wall and hob, remove glass panels carefully (frameless glass panels are heavy and dangerous if dropped). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- all fixtures are removed in a full bathroom strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Plumber must cap exposed plumbing (water supply and waste). Electrician must disconnect spa bath pump and any heated towel rails. Toilet floor flange must be plugged to prevent sewer gas entry. Cast iron bath removal is a significant manual handling risk. Frameless glass shower screen panels can weigh 30-50kg each -- handle with extreme care. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Toilet floor flange condition (may need replacement -- plumber task). Cast iron bath weight and difficulty of removal through doorways. Spa bath pump electrical disconnection. Heated towel rail electrical disconnection (often hard-wired). Mirror removal and disposal (heavy, fragile). Medicine cabinet removal. Shower screen silicone residue on tiles/walls. Bath support cradle/frame under built-in baths. |

---

### B4. Shower Hob/Base Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of the shower hob (raised threshold/curb at the shower entry) and/or the formed shower base (mortar bed that creates the fall to the drain). Many modern renovations convert from hob showers to hobless (level-entry) showers. |
| **Typical method** | **Shower hob:** Cut on both sides with a diamond blade/demo saw, then jackhammer out the hob. Hobs are typically concrete or mortar, sometimes with a timber former inside. **Shower base/mortar bed:** Jackhammer out the mortar bed (typically 40-75mm thick) to expose the slab beneath. The waste pipe and puddle flange are exposed during this process. **For hobless conversion on concrete slab:** May require cutting into the slab 40-50mm to create fall to the drain -- structural implications must be assessed. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** in most bathroom renovations. Hobless conversion is conditional and may require additional slab work. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Care must be taken not to damage the drain pipe or slab reinforcement during jackhammering. If cutting into the slab for hobless conversion, a structural assessment may be needed (especially for waffle-pod slabs). Plumber must reset the puddle flange to the new slab level after demolition. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Drain pipe depth -- may not have enough fall for a hobless shower (requires plumber assessment). Slab thickness limitations on waffle-pod slabs. The puddle flange must be reset by the plumber after hob/base removal (before new waterproofing). Floor level transitions to the rest of the bathroom. Additional waterproofing requirements for hobless showers (full bathroom floor must drain to the shower waste). |

---

### B5. Ceiling Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of bathroom ceiling lining, typically to access services (exhaust fan ducting, lighting, plumbing vent pipes) or to replace damaged/mouldy ceiling material. |
| **Typical method** | Remove light fittings and exhaust fan (electrician to disconnect). Pull down plasterboard or fibrous plaster ceiling sheets. Remove any insulation. Inspect framing for moisture damage or mould. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- not always included in a bathroom renovation. Required when ceiling is water-damaged, mouldy, or when layout changes require service relocation in the ceiling cavity. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Electrician must isolate lighting circuits and disconnect exhaust fan. Pre-1990 fibrous plaster ceilings and textured coatings may contain asbestos -- test before removal. Mould-affected materials require appropriate PPE (P2 respirator, disposable coveralls). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Exhaust fan ducting that needs re-routing or extending. Moisture damage to ceiling framing discovered only after lining removal. Insulation replacement after ceiling reinstatement. Mould remediation in the ceiling cavity. Bathroom exhaust fan must vent to the exterior (not into the roof cavity) -- often discovered as non-compliant during renovation. |

---

### B6. Service Disconnection

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Safe disconnection and isolation of all bathroom services before demolition: water supply (hot and cold), waste/drainage, electrical circuits (lighting, power points, exhaust fan, heated towel rail, spa pump), and any gas (gas hot water or gas heater in the bathroom). |
| **Typical method** | Same as kitchen service disconnection -- licensed trades for each service type. All water isolation valves closed, supplies disconnected and capped. Electrical circuits isolated at the switchboard. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- mandatory first step. |
| **Safety/compliance** | All disconnections by licensed trades. Bathrooms are classified as wet areas with additional electrical safety requirements under AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules) -- zones determine what electrical equipment can be installed where. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | In-slab hot water pipes that cannot be easily isolated. Floor heating (electric or hydronic) requiring disconnection. Multiple electrical circuits (lighting, exhaust fan, power point, heated towel rail may each be on different circuits). Shaver socket/power point circuits in older bathrooms. |

---

### B7. Common Asbestos Locations in Bathrooms

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Identification and management of ACMs specific to bathroom environments in pre-1990 Australian homes. |
| **Common ACM locations** | (1) **Fibro (asbestos cement sheet) wall linings** -- the single most common ACM in Australian bathrooms. Was standard practice to line bathroom walls with asbestos cement sheet (Fibro, Hardiflex of the era) before tiling, particularly in homes built 1940s-1980s. (2) **Vinyl sheet flooring** -- under tiles in bathrooms that have been renovated previously. (3) **Tile adhesive** -- some pre-1990 tile adhesives contain asbestos. (4) **Fibrous plaster ceilings** -- flat sheet or textured/stippled ceilings. (5) **Pipe lagging** around copper hot water pipes in wall cavities and under floors. (6) **Asbestos cement (AC) pipes** used for drainage in some older homes. (7) **Window putty** in bathroom windows. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional but extremely common** in pre-1990 homes. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Same regulations as kitchen asbestos (see A10). Critical difference: fibro wall linings in bathrooms are almost ubiquitous in homes of the era and represent a large volume of ACM. A typical bathroom may contain 15-25m2 of fibro wall sheeting, exceeding the 10m2 threshold for licensed removal. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Fibro sheeting behind tiles is invisible until tiles are removed -- must be assumed present and tested. Old tile adhesive containing asbestos even when the substrate is concrete. Multiple renovation layers concealing original fibro linings. Bathroom ceiling often different material to rest of house (specifically chosen for wet area, often fibro). |

## C. Laundry Strip-Out

### C1. Cabinet and Benchtop Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of laundry cabinetry (base and overhead), benchtop, and any shelving units. Laundry cabinets are typically smaller and simpler than kitchen cabinetry. |
| **Typical method** | Same method as kitchen cabinet removal. Disconnect any plumbing running through cabinets (washing machine taps are often behind or within cabinets). Unscrew cabinets from walls and remove. Remove benchtop (usually laminate in laundries). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in any laundry strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Check for asbestos-containing wall linings behind cabinets (common in pre-1990 laundries). Plumber to disconnect and cap any washing machine taps within or behind cabinets. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Washing machine tap isolation valves often concealed within cabinets. Dryer vent ducting running through cabinetry or wall. Wall damage/asbestos sheeting behind cabinets. Electrical points for appliances within cabinets. |

---

### C2. Tub Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of the laundry trough/tub unit, including associated tapware, waste connection, and any supporting cabinet or legs. |
| **Typical method** | Turn off hot and cold water supply via isolation valves. Disconnect flexible hoses from taps or wall-mounted taps from supply pipes. Disconnect the waste pipe from the trap. Unscrew tub cabinet from wall. Remove the unit. For standalone laundry tubs, simply lift off the legs/frame after disconnecting. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** in laundry strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Plumber required if taps are wall-mounted (need to be removed and supply pipes capped within the wall). If only swapping the tub and not changing tap locations, it can be a relatively simple task, but any pipe capping is defined as plumbing work and requires a licensed plumber. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Wall-mounted tap removal requiring plumber to cap pipes inside the wall. Corroded or seized isolation valves that break during disconnection. Waste pipe condition (older homes may have lead or AC waste pipes). Damage to the wall behind the tub from moisture/splashing over years. |

---

### C3. Flooring Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of laundry floor covering (commonly vinyl sheet, vinyl tiles, or ceramic tiles) down to substrate. |
| **Typical method** | Same methods as kitchen/bathroom flooring removal. Vinyl: score and peel, scrape adhesive. Tiles: jackhammer off, grind adhesive. Screed removal if present. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** in laundry strip-out. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **CRITICAL: Laundries are one of the highest-risk rooms for asbestos-containing flooring in pre-1990 homes.** Vinyl flooring and tile adhesive must be tested. Asbestos cement sheet flooring (laid as underlay or used as substrate) was also common in laundries. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Asbestos-containing vinyl flooring under ceramic tiles (a second flooring layer from a previous renovation). Floor waste (drain) condition -- often blocked or corroded. Floor level transitions to adjacent rooms. Waterproofing requirements in the laundry (AS 3740 applies to laundries too). |

---

### C4. Service Disconnection

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Disconnection of water supply (hot and cold taps for washing machine and tub), waste/drainage, electrical circuits (lighting, power points, dryer circuit), and gas (if gas dryer or gas hot water in laundry). |
| **Typical method** | Licensed plumber to isolate and cap water supplies. Licensed electrician to isolate circuits. Licensed gasfitter to disconnect and cap gas (if present). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- mandatory first step. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Same licensing requirements as kitchen and bathroom. Gas dryers require gasfitter for disconnection. Dryer electrical circuits (often 15A or 20A dedicated circuits) must be isolated by electrician. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Gas bayonet for gas dryer needing capping. Dedicated dryer electrical circuit. External dryer vent/exhaust through the wall. Hot water system located in laundry requiring full disconnection (often gas -- needs gasfitter). Washing machine cold AND hot water supply taps. Overflow relief gully (ORG) connection outside the laundry. |

---

## D. Living Areas

### D1. Wall Removal (Load-Bearing Assessment Critical)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of internal walls in living rooms, dining rooms, hallways, or bedrooms. Opening up living spaces by removing walls between rooms is one of the most common renovation tasks. The load-bearing assessment is the single most critical factor. |
| **Typical method** | **Step 1 -- Load-bearing assessment:** Engage a structural engineer to determine if the wall is load-bearing. Indicators include: wall runs perpendicular to floor/ceiling joists; wall is positioned under a ridge beam or at mid-span of the roof; wall aligns with walls on the floor above; wall is thicker than standard partition walls. **Step 2a -- Non-load-bearing removal:** Strip linings, remove noggings and studs, remove top and bottom plates, patch ceiling and floor. **Step 2b -- Load-bearing removal:** Per engineer's design -- install temporary propping, remove wall, install steel or LVL beam with supporting posts, remove temporary propping. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when layout changes are in scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Structural engineer engagement is non-negotiable for any wall removal where load-bearing status is uncertain. Building permit/approval required for load-bearing wall removal. Must comply with relevant Australian Standards (AS 4100 for steel, AS 1720 for timber). Licensed builder must carry out structural wall removal. Temporary propping must be adequate for the loads -- failure can result in catastrophic collapse. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Services in the wall (power, data, TV antenna cabling, intercom, alarm sensors, plumbing, gas). Structural engineer's fee and lead time (can be 1-3 weeks for report). Building permit processing time. Ceiling sag or deflection after wall removal if not properly engineered. Floor patching where the bottom plate was. Cornice and skirting matching/reinstatement. Ceiling texture matching. |

### D2. Flooring Removal (Carpet, Timber, Tiles)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of living area floor coverings. Type varies: carpet (most common), timber (hardwood boards, engineered timber, floating floors, parquetry), and tiles (ceramic, porcelain, terracotta, slate). |
| **Typical method -- Carpet** | Cut carpet into strips (approximately 600mm wide) with a utility knife. Roll up strips and remove. Remove underlay (usually foam or rubber, stapled or glued). Pull up carpet gripper strips/tack strips from perimeter with a pry bar. Scrape any adhesive residue. |
| **Typical method -- Timber** | **Floating floors:** Use a floor scraper or pry bar to lift and separate click-lock planks. **Glued/direct-stick timber:** Use a floor scraper machine to get under boards. Heat gun may help soften adhesive. Boards usually destroyed in removal. **Nailed hardwood boards:** Pry up boards with a crowbar, extract nails from joists. |
| **Typical method -- Tiles** | Same as kitchen/bathroom -- jackhammer with chisel bit. Tiles on concrete slab: remove tiles, grind adhesive. Tiles on timber subfloor: remove tiles carefully to preserve subfloor where possible. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- depends on renovation scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Carpet underlay in pre-1990 homes may contain asbestos (especially jute-backed rubber underlay with asbestos content). Vinyl tiles under carpet (sometimes found) may contain asbestos. Timber floor removal generates significant dust. Tile removal: silica dust and noise hazards. Old carpet may contain mould, dust mites, and allergens -- wear P2 mask. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Carpet gripper strip removal (causes damage to skirting boards and leaves hundreds of nail holes in the floor). Subfloor condition under carpet (may be stained, damaged, or uneven). Multiple flooring layers under carpet. Asbestos-containing vinyl tiles hidden under carpet. Floor height differences when changing flooring type (e.g., going from carpet + underlay to tiles changes the floor height, affecting door clearances). Timber floor boards may be resaleable/recyclable -- check before destroying. |

---

### D3. Ceiling Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of ceiling linings in living areas, typically plasterboard (post-1980s homes), fibrous plaster (1950s-1980s), or lath and plaster (pre-1950s). May include removal of cornices, ceiling roses, and decorative mouldings. |
| **Typical method** | Electrician isolates all ceiling circuits (lights, smoke detectors, ceiling fans). Remove light fittings and ceiling fan. For plasterboard: score joints, pull down sheets. For fibrous plaster: pull down sheets (heavy -- 2 person minimum). For lath and plaster: pull down plaster first, then remove timber laths. Remove insulation if present. Inspect framing for damage, termites, or moisture. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when ceiling is damaged, contains asbestos, or when design requires ceiling height changes or service relocation. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **CRITICAL: Fibrous plaster ceilings and textured coatings (stipple, swirl, popcorn) in pre-1990 homes are high-risk for asbestos.** Must be tested. If positive, licensed asbestos removal required. Ceiling removal is extremely dusty and creates heavy debris -- full PPE required. Structural integrity of ceiling joists must be assessed. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Insulation falling during removal (messy, potentially irritating fibreglass). Electrical wiring running on top of ceiling sheets. Plumbing or HVAC ductwork in ceiling cavity. Termite damage to ceiling framing. Smoke detector relocation and compliance with AS 3786. Ceiling fan electrical disconnection (often a separate circuit from lighting). |

---

### D4. Built-in Furniture/Shelving Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of built-in robes/wardrobes, bookshelves, entertainment units, window seats, and other fixed joinery items in living areas and bedrooms. |
| **Typical method** | Remove shelves and internal fittings first. Unscrew carcass from wall studs. Cut any silicone or adhesive seals with a utility knife. Remove unit in sections if too large. Patch walls and floor where fixings were. Built-in robes: remove sliding or hinged doors first, then internal shelving/drawers, then carcass sides and top. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when scope requires removal. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Check for electrical services within or behind built-in units (power points, TV points, light switches). Built-in wardrobes in pre-1990 homes may have asbestos cement sheet backing. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Wall damage behind built-in units (unpainted, different wall lining, holes, no plaster). Floor covering under built-in robes (carpet/tiles often not laid under robes -- leaves an exposed patch). Electrical services relocated behind/within robes over the years. Skirting board missing behind robes. Wall framing modifications made to accommodate original installation. |

---

## E. Outdoor / Deck

### E1. Deck Demolition (Timber Deck Removal, Concrete Patio Removal)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Complete removal of outdoor decking structures, including decking boards, joists, bearers, stumps/posts, and any associated stairs, railings, and fascia. For concrete patios: removal of the concrete slab, any reinforcement mesh, and sub-base. |
| **Typical method -- Timber deck** | Remove decking boards (unscrew or pry off nailed boards). Remove joist and bearer framing. Remove posts/stumps -- dig out if set in concrete footings or unbolt if on metal stirrups. Fill footing holes. Treated timber must be disposed of at a licensed facility (cannot be burned or composted). |
| **Typical method -- Concrete patio** | Cut relief lines with a concrete saw (diamond blade). Break up with a jackhammer or hire a small excavator with a hydraulic breaker attachment for large areas. Remove reinforcement mesh with bolt cutters. Load debris into skip bin or truck (concrete is very heavy -- factor into skip bin weight limits). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when outdoor works are in scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Check for underground services before digging out stumps or breaking concrete (Dial Before You Dig -- call 1100 or use DBYD online). Treated timber (CCA/ACQ) is classified as hazardous waste and must be disposed of appropriately. Asbestos cement sheeting may be present under decks as infill panels or as fascia material in older homes. Concrete dust contains crystalline silica -- wet-cut and wear P2 respirator. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Stump footings below ground that need to be dug out. Services running under the deck (downpipes, stormwater, electrical conduit, garden taps). Flashings and fixings where the deck connects to the house (may need resealing). Termite damage to deck substructure -- budget for potential pest inspection/treatment if damage is found. Council requirements for demolition of large decks (may need permit depending on size and height). Concrete patio weight -- a 4m x 4m x 100mm slab weighs approximately 4 tonnes. |

---

### E2. Pergola/Shade Structure Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Dismantling and removal of pergolas, shade sails, carport-style structures, and attached shade structures including roofing (polycarbonate, Colorbond, shade cloth, timber slats), framing (timber or steel), posts, and footings. |
| **Typical method** | Remove roofing material first (polycarbonate sheets, shade cloth, Colorbond sheets). Remove horizontal beams and rafters. Remove vertical posts -- dig out concrete footings or unbolt from brackets. For steel structures, may need an angle grinder to cut if bolts are seized. For large structures, dismantling should be sequential from top to bottom with temporary bracing. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when outdoor works require it. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Working at height -- fall protection may be required for structures over 2m. Ensure structure is adequately braced during progressive dismantling (partial removal can make remaining structure unstable). Check for electrical services (lights, fans, power points on pergola). Asbestos cement roofing sheets (fibro) may be present on older pergolas -- test before removal. CCA-treated timber disposal requirements apply. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Electrical wiring in the pergola (lights, ceiling fan, power point) requiring electrician disconnection. Downpipes and guttering connected to stormwater. Concrete footings below ground level needing excavation. Attachment points to the house wall (ledger board) -- removal leaves holes in brickwork or cladding that need repair. Shade sail fixing points (eye bolts in structural walls). Council approval may be needed for removal of structures listed in a DA. |

---

### E3. Retaining Wall Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of retaining walls (timber sleeper, concrete block, brick, stone, or gabion basket) that are holding back soil. This is a structurally significant task as the wall is performing a critical function. |
| **Typical method** | **Assessment first:** Determine what the wall is retaining and what will happen when it is removed (soil collapse, impact on neighbouring properties, impact on structures). **Timber sleeper walls:** Remove sleepers from top to bottom, excavating behind as you go or replacing with a new wall. **Concrete block/brick walls:** Demolish with jackhammer or excavator from top to bottom, managing soil behind. **Must be replaced** with a new retaining solution if soil levels need to be maintained. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- significant scope item requiring careful assessment. |
| **Safety/compliance** | **CRITICAL: Retaining walls affect soil stability -- removal without an engineering plan can cause soil collapse, property damage, and danger to life.** Council approval: Retaining walls over 600mm (NSW) or 1,000mm (most other states) typically require council approval for construction -- same may apply to removal. Removal near boundaries requires consideration of neighbour impacts (Dividing Fences Act). Engineer assessment recommended for any retaining wall over 600mm. Soil erosion control during removal. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | What happens to the retained soil when the wall is removed (temporary shoring needed). Impact on neighbouring properties (soil from your property flowing onto theirs). Stormwater drainage behind the retaining wall (ag drain/weep holes) that needs to be managed. Replacement retaining solution cost. Services buried behind or under the retaining wall. Tree/vegetation roots intertwined with the wall. |

---

### E4. Garden Bed/Landscaping Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of garden beds, edging (timber, concrete, steel, brick), soil/mulch, plants/shrubs/small trees, and any associated irrigation systems. |
| **Typical method** | Remove plants and shrubs (hand dig or mini-excavator for larger plants). Remove edging material. Excavate soil/mulch to required level. Remove irrigation pipework. Level site. For large trees, an arborist may be required. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when site works or new landscaping is in scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Check for protected trees under local council tree preservation orders (TPO) before removal -- fines for unauthorised removal can be significant. Check for underground services (Dial Before You Dig). CCA-treated timber edging is hazardous waste. Soil disposal: contaminated soil (e.g., from old raised beds using CCA timber) may require testing before disposal. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Irrigation pipework and controller disconnection. Root systems that extend beyond the visible garden bed. Soil disposal costs (green waste/soil is heavy and expensive to dispose of). Protected trees requiring council approval. Tap timer/irrigation controller removal. Garden lighting electrical disconnection. |

---

### E5. Concrete Path Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Removal of concrete pathways, driveways, and footpaths around the property. Includes breaking the concrete, removing reinforcement, excavating the sub-base, and disposing of material. |
| **Typical method** | Cut expansion joints or relief lines with a concrete saw. Break concrete with a jackhammer (hand-held for paths, excavator-mounted for driveways). Cut reinforcement mesh with bolt cutters. Load debris into skip bin or truck. Concrete recycling is available -- crushed concrete can be reused as road base. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when outdoor works require it. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Dial Before You Dig (DBYD) is mandatory -- services often run under or alongside paths. Concrete dust contains crystalline silica -- wet-cutting mandatory, P2 respirator required. Heavy material -- consider skip bin weight limits (concrete is approximately 2.4 tonnes per cubic metre). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Services buried under the path (stormwater, electrical conduit, gas lines, water mains). Concrete thickness may be greater than expected (particularly at edges or where it abuts structures). Sub-base removal and disposal. Concrete weight impact on skip bin costs (exceeding weight limits incurs surcharges). Edge damage to adjacent surfaces (garden beds, lawn, other paths). Soil backfill needed after concrete and sub-base removal. |

## F. General / Whole Home

### F1. Skip Bin Sizing Guide

| Size | Typical Dimensions (L x W x H) | Equivalent | Best Suited For | Approximate Cost (Sydney, 2025) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2m3** | 1.5m x 1.5m x 1.0m | ~8 wheelie bins | Small cleanout, single room carpet removal, garden waste | $250 - $350 |
| **3m3** | 2.0m x 1.5m x 1.0m | ~12 wheelie bins | Small bathroom strip-out, small renovation, single-room clearout | $300 - $450 |
| **4m3** | 2.5m x 1.5m x 1.2m | ~16 wheelie bins | Average kitchen OR bathroom strip-out, medium renovation | $350 - $550 |
| **6m3** | 3.0m x 1.5m x 1.5m | ~24 wheelie bins | Combined kitchen + bathroom strip-out, multi-room flooring removal, large renovation | $450 - $700 |
| **8m3** | 3.5m x 1.8m x 1.5m | ~32 wheelie bins | Full home strip-out, large extension demolition, deck + pergola removal | $550 - $900 |
| **10m3+** | 4.0m x 1.8m x 1.5m+ | ~40+ wheelie bins | Major demolition, whole-home renovation, commercial strip-out | $700 - $1,200+ |

**Key notes on skip bin selection:**

- **Weight limits apply:** Most skip bins have a weight limit (e.g., 4m3 bin may have a 500-750kg limit). Concrete, tiles, and soil are very heavy and will hit weight limits well before volume limits. Ask about weight allowances when hiring.
- **Concrete/heavy waste:** Many bin suppliers offer dedicated "heavy waste" or "bricks and concrete" bins at different rates. A 4m3 heavy bin may cost more but have a 2-tonne weight limit.
- **Prohibited items in general skip bins:** Asbestos, batteries, chemicals, paint, tyres, gas bottles, food waste, liquids, medical waste. Asbestos requires a dedicated asbestos skip bin or bagging and licensed disposal.
- **Placement:** Bins on council property (nature strip, road) require a council permit. On your driveway does not. Check access width for delivery truck.
- **Multiple bins:** For larger projects, it is often more practical and cost-effective to have one bin at a time and arrange multiple pickups/swaps rather than having one very large bin.
- **Sorting waste saves money:** Mixed waste tips at $350-$450/tonne (Sydney, 2025). Sorted concrete tips at $22-$28/tonne. Sorted clean fill at $220/tonne. Sorting on-site can reduce disposal costs by 20-30%.

---

### F2. Site Protection

| Protection Type | What It Involves | When Required | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dust barriers** | Polyethylene sheeting (200 micron minimum) or ZipWall-style temporary walls erected to seal off the demolition zone from occupied areas of the home. Sealed at floor, ceiling, and wall junctions with tape. Double-zip entry door for access. Negative air pressure maintained with HEPA-filtered air scrubber for asbestos or heavy dust work. | Standard for any internal demolition where occupants remain in the home or where adjacent areas must stay clean. Essential for asbestos removal. | ZipWall poles + poly sheeting, or timber/steel frame with poly sheeting. All joints taped with duct tape or specialised containment tape. Air scrubber running inside the containment zone. |
| **Floor protection** | Protect existing flooring in access paths and adjacent rooms. Two-layer system: soft layer (builder's felt or cardboard) to prevent scratching, topped with hard layer (Masonite or plywood) for impact protection. Self-adhesive protective film for short-duration protection. | Standard for any project where existing floors are to be retained. Critical in hallways, entries, and stairs used for material/waste removal. | Lay builder's felt or Ram Board, tape seams, overlay with Masonite sheets on high-traffic paths. Secure edges with tape to prevent tripping. |
| **Door protection** | Protective coverings (cardboard or foam) on door faces, frames, and handles in access paths. Door removal where necessary to prevent damage during large item removal. | Standard -- commonly applied to front entry door and any doors in the demolition access path. | Tape cardboard or corrugated plastic to door faces. Remove doors from hinges if they are in the way of waste removal (label and store safely). |
| **Stair protection** | Protective covering on stair treads, nosings, and handrails. Typically builder's felt + Masonite or plywood treads secured with screws (not nails, which damage timber stairs). | Required whenever stairs are in the demolition access path, especially for upper-storey bathroom or bedroom demolition. | Builder's felt on each tread, plywood or Masonite overlay screwed down (pre-drill to avoid splitting). Handrails wrapped in cardboard or pipe lagging. |
| **Garden/lawn protection** | Ply sheets or track mats over lawn areas where skip bins are placed or where there is heavy foot/wheelbarrow traffic. | Conditional -- when skip bin is on lawn or waste removal route crosses garden/lawn areas. | Lay plywood sheets or rubber mats on the ground before skip bin delivery. |

---

### F3. Temporary Services

| Service | What It Involves | When Required |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporary power** | When the main switchboard is being relocated or demolished, or when circuits serving the work area are isolated, temporary power must be provided. This typically involves a temporary switchboard (spider box) connected to an active circuit or a generator. All temporary electrical installations must comply with AS/NZS 3000 and AS/NZS 3012 (Electrical installations -- Construction and demolition sites). | Conditional -- required when demolition work isolates the switchboard or main circuits. Also required on sites where power has been disconnected entirely. |
| **Temporary water** | When the water mains are disconnected or the only tap access is in the demolition zone, temporary water supply must be arranged. This may involve a temporary hose connection from an external tap or neighbour's supply. | Conditional -- required when plumbing demolition affects the only water supply. Also needed for dust suppression during demolition. |
| **Temporary toilet** | If the only toilet in the home is being demolished, a portable toilet must be provided for workers and occupants. | Conditional -- required when the only toilet is in the demolition zone. Often forgotten but a WHS requirement for workers on-site. |
| **Temporary fencing** | Temporary construction fencing (or hoarding) to secure the site, prevent public access, and contain debris. | Conditional -- required for street-facing demolition, when demolition creates unsafe conditions, or when council requires it as a condition of consent. |

---

### F4. Rubbish Removal and Tip Fees

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Waste types from demolition** | Mixed building waste, concrete/masonry, timber (treated and untreated), plasterboard, tiles/ceramics, metals (steel, copper, aluminium), glass, carpet and underlay, soil/fill, green waste, hazardous waste (asbestos, paint, chemicals). |
| **Disposal methods** | (1) Skip bin hire (most common for residential renovations); (2) Tip truck / trailer loads taken directly to waste facility; (3) Rubbish removal service (they load and take away); (4) On-site waste separation for recycling. |
| **Tip fee guide (Sydney metro, 2025)** | Mixed building waste: $350-$450 per tonne. Clean concrete: $22-$28 per tonne. Clean fill/soil: $220 per tonne. Green waste: ~$100 per tonne. Plasterboard (clean): ~$150 per tonne. Metals: Often free or credited (scrap value). Asbestos: $300-$500+ per tonne at licensed facilities. Note: NSW metropolitan levy is $174.20 per tonne on top of gate fees. |
| **Cost-saving strategies** | Sort waste on-site into separate piles (concrete, timber, mixed, metal). Concrete is cheap to tip -- keep it separate. Metals have scrap value -- separate copper pipe, steel, and aluminium. Clean timber can go to green waste. Plasterboard should be separated from mixed waste (some facilities recycle it at lower cost). |
| **Commonly forgotten costs** | Metropolitan waste levy (included in tip fees but often overlooked when estimating). Skip bin weight surcharges. Multiple bin swaps during a project. Asbestos disposal premium. Travel time to tip (for tradies charging hourly). Saturday/after-hours tip surcharges. |

---

### F5. Disconnection of Services -- Summary (Who Does What)

| Service | Licensed Trade Required | Scope of Disconnection Work | Compliance Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Electrical** | Licensed Electrician (must hold state-issued licence) | Isolate circuits at switchboard, disconnect and remove hard-wired appliances (oven, cooktop, rangehood, heated towel rail, spa pump, ceiling fan, smoke detectors, downlights), cap or remove cable runs, remove power points and switches if walls being demolished. | Work must comply with AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules). Electrician issues a Certificate of Compliance (CCEW) or equivalent for the work. Unlicensed electrical work is illegal in all states. |
| **Plumbing (water)** | Licensed Plumber (must hold state-issued licence) | Isolate water supply (hot and cold) at meter or isolation valves, disconnect fixtures (taps, toilets, basins, sinks, bathtubs, washing machine taps), cap exposed pipework, disconnect and cap water supply to appliances (dishwasher, fridge ice maker). | Work must comply with AS/NZS 3500 (Plumbing and Drainage). Plumber should ensure all exposed pipework is capped with appropriate fittings (not just taped or plugged). |
| **Plumbing (drainage)** | Licensed Plumber | Disconnect waste pipes from fixtures, cap or plug floor wastes and drain connections to prevent sewer gas, remove S-traps and P-traps. | Floor waste plugs MUST be installed to prevent sewer gas entry into the home. Compliance with AS/NZS 3500.2 (Sanitary plumbing and drainage). |
| **Gas** | Licensed Gasfitter (or Plumber with Gasfitting endorsement) | Isolate gas supply at meter or isolation valve, disconnect gas appliances (cooktop, oven, gas heater, gas hot water system, gas dryer), cap gas supply lines, perform gas leak/pressure test after capping. | Gas work must comply with AS/NZS 5601 (Gas installations). Gasfitter must issue a compliance certificate for all gas work. Attempting unlicensed gas work is a criminal offence. Gas supplier may need to be notified if the meter is being removed. |
| **Communications/data** | Licensed Cabler (for structured cabling) / NBN for NBN connections | Disconnect and remove phone lines, data cabling, TV antenna cabling, NBN connection (if in demolition zone), security system wiring, intercom wiring. | NBN connections require an NBN-authorised technician for disconnection/reconnection. Do not cut NBN fibre -- it is expensive to repair. Phone line disconnection may involve Telstra/carrier notification. |
| **Solar** | Licensed Electrician (with CEC accreditation preferred) | Isolate solar inverter and DC isolator, disconnect panels if on a roof being demolished, ensure system is safely shut down before any roof work. | Solar panels produce DC electricity when exposed to light and CANNOT be fully switched off. The DC cables between panels and inverter are always live during daylight. Only qualified personnel should handle solar disconnections. |

---

## Commonly Forgotten Items -- Master Checklist

The following items are frequently omitted from demolition scope-of-works documents but regularly arise on Australian residential renovation projects:

1. **Asbestos testing** -- must be done before any demolition in pre-1990 homes (budget $30-$50 per sample, typically 3-10 samples per project).
2. **Asbestos removal costs** -- if ACMs are found, removal and disposal is a significant unbudgeted cost.
3. **Service disconnection trades** -- the cost of having the electrician, plumber, and gasfitter attend for disconnections before demolition starts.
4. **Wall and ceiling patching** -- after strip-out, walls and ceilings almost always need patching, skimming, or full replacement.
5. **Floor levelling** -- after tile/screed removal, slabs are rarely level and need self-levelling compound.
6. **Door clearance adjustments** -- floor height changes from flooring removal often require door trimming.
7. **Skip bin weight surcharges** -- concrete and tiles are heavy; a seemingly small volume can exceed weight limits.
8. **Structural engineer's fees** -- for any wall removal where load-bearing status is uncertain.
9. **Building permits** -- for structural alterations (load-bearing wall removal, retaining wall changes).
10. **Temporary services** -- temporary toilet, power, or water if only facilities are in the demolition zone.
11. **Site protection** -- dust barriers, floor protection, and access path protection.
12. **Neighbour notification** -- for asbestos removal (required) and as a courtesy for noisy/dusty demolition work.
13. **Dial Before You Dig** -- for any excavation, concrete breaking, or stump removal outdoors.
14. **Smoke detector relocation** -- after ceiling removal or modification, smoke detectors must be reinstated per AS 3786.
15. **Skirting and cornice reinstatement** -- after wall removal or flooring changes, skirting and cornice must be matched and replaced.
