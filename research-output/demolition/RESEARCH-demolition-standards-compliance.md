## 1. Asbestos Regulations by State/Territory

### 1.1 Background: The Asbestos Ban & Age Thresholds

Australia banned all forms of asbestos (importation, manufacture, and use) effective **31 December 2003**. However, asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) were most commonly used in buildings constructed **before 1990**. Buildings constructed between 1990 and 2003 may still contain ACMs but at lower probability.

**Confidence**: HIGH

**Key age thresholds for the AI scope generator**:

| Construction Period | Asbestos Risk Level | Inspection Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-1990** | HIGH -- very likely contains ACMs | Mandatory asbestos inspection before any demolition/renovation work in all states |
| **1990--2003** | MODERATE -- may contain ACMs | Inspection strongly recommended; mandatory for workplaces in most jurisdictions |
| **Post-2003** | LOW -- should not contain ACMs (ban in effect) | No asbestos inspection generally required unless imported materials suspected |

### 1.2 Asbestos Class Definitions (National)

| Class | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Class A (Friable)** | Can be crumbled or reduced to powder by hand pressure | Insulation, pipe lagging, sprayed coatings, some ceiling tiles. Highest risk. |
| **Class B (Non-Friable / Bonded)** | Firmly bound in a matrix (e.g., cement) | Fibro sheeting, vinyl tiles, cement pipes, roofing. Lower risk when undisturbed. |

**Confidence**: HIGH

### 7.3 Key Rules for the AI Scope Generator

1. **Always check heritage status** before generating any demolition scope
2. Heritage properties generally **cannot be demolished** without specific approval
3. Even **internal demolition** may require heritage approval if:
   - The interior is specifically listed or protected
   - The Heritage Overlay schedule specifies internal alteration controls
   - The work would affect the heritage significance of the place
4. **Penalties for unauthorised demolition** of heritage places are severe and may include:
   - Orders to reconstruct/restore at owner's expense

  - Sequence of demolition/construction activities

### 8.3 Installation and Supervision

- Shoring must be **installed by or under supervision of** an experienced and qualified professional
- The **structural engineer** should inspect the shoring after installation and before demolition commences
- Regular **monitoring** during demolition is recommended
- **Removal of shoring** must only occur after the new permanent structural elements are in place and certified

### 8.4 Reference Standards

| Standard | Description |
|---|---|
| **AS 2601-2001** | The Demolition of Structures -- primary demolition standard |
| **AS 3600** | Concrete Structures -- relevant for concrete demolition |
