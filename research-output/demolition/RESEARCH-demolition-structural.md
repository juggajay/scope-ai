## 1. Load-Bearing Wall Identification

### 1.1 Overview

A load-bearing (structural) wall carries weight from the roof, upper floors, or ceiling structure down through the building to the foundations. Removing or modifying one without proper engineering creates a serious risk of structural failure, ceiling sag, cracking, or collapse. **A structural engineer assessment is always required for certainty** --- visual indicators can only provide a preliminary indication.

### 1.2 Common Indicators for Homeowners

The following indicators can help homeowners form a preliminary view, but they are **not a substitute for professional assessment**.

| Indicator | What to Look For | Likelihood of Load-Bearing |
|---|---|---|
| **Wall runs perpendicular to ceiling joists/rafters** | If you can access the roof space and see that joists or rafters rest on or terminate at the wall | High |
| **Wall runs down the centre of the house** | Central walls (parallel to the ridge line) typically carry midspan roof or ceiling loads | High |
| **Wall sits directly on a concrete footing** | Visible in subfloor areas (stumped homes); a dedicated strip footing under a wall indicates it was designed to carry load | High |
| **Thicker wall construction** | Noticeably thicker than standard 90mm stud partition walls (e.g., 140mm or brick) | Moderate--High |
| **Wall directly below an upper-storey wall** | In two-storey homes, walls stacked vertically almost always carry load from above | Very High |
| **Visible tie-downs, cyclone rods, or thicker top plates** | These are structural connection elements | High |
| **Wall supports a beam or lintel** | If a beam visibly lands on the wall | Very High |
| **Wall is an external wall** | All external walls in both timber-frame and masonry homes carry some load (roof, wind bracing) | Very High |
| **Wall is a thin plasterboard partition with no footing** | Lightweight, clearly non-structural | Low |

### 1.3 How Construction Types Differ

#### Timber-Frame Homes

- **Structure:** Load is carried by a timber frame (studs, top/bottom plates, noggins). The frame is typically hidden behind plasterboard lining.
- **Load-bearing walls:** Both external walls and selected internal walls carry roof and ceiling loads. Internal load-bearing walls typically have a thicker top plate (double top plate) and sit on a bearer/joist or concrete strip footing.
- **Non-load-bearing walls:** Internal partition walls are usually single-stud frames with a single top plate, sitting on a floor without a dedicated footing.
- **Identification challenge:** All walls look the same externally (plasterboard). You must inspect the roof space to see where loads transfer, or obtain original structural drawings.

#### Brick Veneer Homes

- **Structure:** The structural frame is timber (or light-gauge steel). The outer brick skin (single leaf/wythe) is a cladding only --- it is tied to the frame but does **not** carry structural load.
- **Load-bearing walls:** The timber or steel frame carries all roof and floor loads. Selected internal framed walls may be load-bearing. The external frame behind the brick veneer carries load.
- **Key distinction:** The outer brickwork is non-load-bearing. There is no header course (bricks laid end-on) in a veneer wall --- all bricks show their stretcher face.
- **Identification challenge:** Similar to timber-frame; you cannot tell from the brick exterior alone. Internal walls require inspection of roof framing connections.

#### Double Brick (Solid Masonry) Homes

- **Structure:** Walls are two or more leaves of brickwork bonded together. These walls are self-supporting and load-bearing. Common in pre-1960s homes, particularly in WA, SA, and some areas of VIC and NSW.
- **Load-bearing walls:** All external double-brick walls carry roof loads. **Internal brick walls** (if double-leaf or bonded to external walls) often carry significant load. Internal brick walls thicker than 110mm (single leaf) are frequently structural.
- **Key distinction:** You can identify a load-bearing brick wall by looking for a **header course** (bricks laid end-on, visible every 5th--7th course), indicating bonded multi-leaf construction. Single-leaf (110mm) internal brick walls may or may not be structural.
- **Identification challenge:** Some internal single-leaf brick walls in double-brick homes are partition walls only, but many carry load. Never assume.

### 1.4 When a Homeowner Cannot Tell

If **any** of the following apply, a structural engineer **must** be engaged before any work proceeds:

- The homeowner is unsure whether the wall is load-bearing
- Original structural drawings are not available
- The home is double-storey
- The home is double brick
- The wall runs perpendicular to roof framing
- The wall is an external wall
- There are signs of existing structural movement (cracks, sagging)

**Bottom line:** An engineer assessment is mandatory before removing any wall that might be structural. The cost of getting it wrong (structural failure, non-compliant work, voided insurance) vastly outweighs the cost of an engineering report.

## 2. Structural Engineer Requirements

### 2.1 When Is a Structural Engineer Needed?

A structural engineer is required whenever:

- A load-bearing wall is being removed or modified
- A new opening is being created in a structural wall (e.g., wider doorway, pass-through)
- The structure is being altered in any way that changes load paths
- There is uncertainty about whether a wall is load-bearing
- Council or a private certifier requires engineering documentation for a building permit
- A beam, column, or footing is being designed or installed

In practice, **any internal renovation that touches a structural wall requires an engineer**.

### 2.2 What Does a Structural Engineer Provide?

| Deliverable | Description |
|---|---|
| **Site inspection report** | Assessment of the existing structure, identification of load-bearing elements, and feasibility of the proposed work |
| **Beam design (sizing and specification)** | Calculation and specification of the replacement beam (steel UB, LVL, or other). Includes span, depth, grade, and deflection checks to AS 4100 (steel) or AS 1720 (timber) |
| **Propping plan** | Detailed plan for temporary support during demolition and beam installation, including prop locations, spacing, and load limits |
| **Connection details** | Engineering drawings showing how the beam connects to posts/columns, how posts connect to footings, and how the beam connects to existing structure (e.g., top plate, rafters) |
| **Footing design** | If new pad footings are required for posts/columns, the engineer specifies size, depth, reinforcement, and concrete grade per AS 2870 |
| **Structural drawings** | Formal engineering drawings suitable for submission with a building permit/CDC application |
| **Certification / compliance certificate** | Upon completion of work (or at inspection stages), the engineer certifies that the work has been built in accordance with the approved design. In Queensland, this is a **Form 15** (design compliance) and **Form 16** (inspection certificate) |

### 2.3 Typical Cost Ranges (Australia, 2025--2026)

| Service | Typical Cost Range (AUD, incl. GST) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Initial consultation / site inspection | $300 -- $600 | Some firms offer a fixed-fee initial visit |
| Load-bearing wall assessment only | $250 -- $1,000 | Depends on complexity and access |
| Beam design + structural drawings | $800 -- $3,000 | Single wall removal; simple residential |
| Full structural drawings package | $3,000 -- $5,000+ | More complex scope, multiple walls, or two-storey |
| Hourly rate (if charged hourly) | $100 -- $300/hr (excl. GST) | Varies by experience and location |
| Completion inspection + certification | $400 -- $800 | Return visit to certify installed work |
| Percentage-based fee (large projects) | 5% -- 12% of construction cost | For major renovations or new builds |

**Note:** Metropolitan areas (Sydney, Melbourne) tend to be at the higher end. Regional areas may be lower but have fewer available engineers.

## 3. Temporary Propping

### 3.1 What Is Temporary Propping?

Temporary propping is the installation of adjustable steel props (commonly called **Acrow props**) and timber or steel spreader beams to temporarily support the structure above a load-bearing wall while it is being demolished and replaced with a permanent beam. It transfers the load that the wall was carrying to the temporary supports until the new beam is in place and capable of taking load.

### 3.2 When Is It Needed?

Temporary propping is needed **whenever a load-bearing wall is being removed or significantly modified**. This includes:

- Full wall removal
- Partial wall removal (creating a larger opening)
- Removal of a structural column or post
- Any work that interrupts the load path from roof/floor to foundation

### 3.3 Who Provides It?

| Party | Role |
|---|---|
| **Structural engineer** | Designs the propping plan (prop locations, sizes, loads, sequence) |
| **Licensed builder / carpenter** | Installs and removes the props on site per the engineer's plan |
| **Hire company** (e.g., Coates, Shore Hire, Cassaform) | Supplies Acrow props and other propping equipment for hire. Props can also be purchased from Bunnings or specialist suppliers |

### 3.4 What Does a Propping Plan Include?

A structural engineer's propping plan typically specifies:

- **Prop locations** --- exact positions on each side of the wall to be removed, with spacing dimensions
- **Prop type and capacity** --- Acrow prop size (No. 0 through No. 4, depending on height and load), or alternative temporary stud wall specification
- **Spreader beams** --- timber or steel beams placed above and below the props to distribute load across joists/flooring and prevent point-load damage
- **Propping sequence** --- the order in which props are installed, the wall is removed, and the permanent beam is fitted
- **Load calculations** --- confirmation that the temporary support can carry the imposed loads
- **Safety margins** --- minimum factors of safety

### 3.5 How Long Does Propping Stay in Place?

| Scenario | Typical Duration |
|---|---|
| Simple single-wall removal (single storey) | 1 -- 3 days |
| More complex removal (e.g., longer span, two storey) | 3 -- 7 days |
| Where new concrete footings are required (curing time) | 7 -- 28 days (concrete needs to reach design strength) |
| Where new masonry is involved | Minimum 24 -- 48 hours for mortar to set |

Props must remain in place until:

1. The permanent beam is fully installed and properly connected
2. All supporting posts/columns are in place and secured
3. Any new footings have reached adequate strength (typically 7-day strength for light loads, 28-day for full design load)
4. The structural engineer has approved removal of props (if specified)

**Safety note:** Acrow props are designed for temporary support only and must never be used as a permanent structural solution. If left in place for extended periods, they should be inspected weekly.

### 3.6 Typical Propping Costs

| Item | Typical Cost (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Acrow prop hire (per prop, per week) | $15 -- $40 |
| Acrow prop purchase | $60 -- $150 each |
| Timber spreader beams | $50 -- $200 (materials) |
| Installation labour (by builder) | Typically included in builder's quote for wall removal |

## 4. Steel Beam Installation

### 4.1 Overview

When a load-bearing wall is removed, the load it carried must be redirected through a new structural element --- most commonly a **steel universal beam (UB)** or a **laminated veneer lumber (LVL) beam**. Steel is the most common choice for longer spans and heavier loads in Australian residential renovations.

### 4.2 Scope Items Involved

#### 4.2.1 Beam Supply and Sizing

- The structural engineer specifies the beam size based on span, load (dead load + live load), and deflection limits
- Common residential beam sizes: **150UB**, **200UB**, **250UB**, **310UB** (the number refers to nominal depth in mm)
- Beams are supplied in standard 9m or 12m lengths and cut to size
- Finish options: mill finish (raw), primed, or galvanised
- Beams are typically ordered from steel suppliers (e.g., Edcon Steel, Scott Metals, Handy Steel Supplies, RHS Steel Supplies)

**Typical beam material costs (2025--2026):**

| Beam Size | Approx. Cost per 9m Length (excl. GST) | Approx. Cost per Linear Metre |
|---|---|---|
| 200UB22.3 | $800 -- $950 | $89 -- $105/m |
| 200UB29.8 | $830 -- $940 | $92 -- $105/m |
| 250UB25.7 | $710 -- $810 | $79 -- $90/m |
| 250UB31.4 | $870 -- $990 | $97 -- $110/m |
| 250UB37.3 | $1,030 -- $1,180 | $115 -- $131/m |
| 310UB32.0 | $890 -- $1,010 | $99 -- $112/m |
| 310UB40.4 | $1,120 -- $1,280 | $124 -- $142/m |
| 310UB46.2 | $1,280 -- $1,460 | $142 -- $162/m |

*Prices vary by supplier, region, and market conditions. Primed finish adds approximately $10--$15/m.*

**LVL beams as an alternative:**

- LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) beams are lighter, easier to handle, and cheaper for shorter spans
- Typically cost $55 -- $400 depending on size and length
- Suitable for lighter loads and shorter spans (up to approximately 5--6m for residential)
- Steel is preferred for longer spans, heavier loads, or where minimum beam depth is critical

#### 4.2.2 Installation Method

The typical installation sequence is:

1. **Engineer designs beam, connections, and propping plan**
2. **Building permit / CDC obtained** (with structural drawings)
3. **Temporary propping installed** on both sides of the wall
4. **Services relocated** --- any electrical wiring, plumbing, or data cabling within the wall is rerouted by licensed trades
5. **Wall demolished** --- plasterboard/lining removed, framing or brickwork removed
6. **Beam lifted into position** --- steel beams are heavy (a 250UB37.3 weighs ~37.3 kg/m; a 4m beam weighs ~150 kg). Two or more workers, or mechanical lifting, is required
7. **Beam set on posts/columns** at each end (and at intermediate points if specified)
8. **Connections made** --- beam bolted or welded to posts; beam connected to existing structure (rafters, joists, top plates) per engineer's detail
9. **Beam checked for level and alignment**
10. **Temporary props removed** (only after permanent connections are confirmed secure)
11. **Beam wrapped/clad** in plasterboard or timber for fire rating and aesthetic finish
12. **Inspection by certifier** at critical stages

#### 4.2.3 Posts/Columns and Connections

- Where the beam meets a support point (typically at each end, sometimes mid-span), a **steel post** (SHS --- Square Hollow Section, or CHS --- Circular Hollow Section) or **timber post** transfers the beam load to the footing
- Connection types include:
  - **Bolted base plate** --- steel plate welded to the post base, bolted to a concrete footing with anchor bolts (e.g., M16 chemical anchors)
  - **Bolted top connection** --- beam sits on a bearing plate on top of the post, or is bolted through a cleat/bracket
  - **Welded connections** --- sometimes used in steel-to-steel connections, but bolted is more common in residential
- All connection details must be specified by the structural engineer
- Posts can be concealed within the wall framing at each end of the opening

#### 4.2.4 Pad Footings (If Needed)

- If the beam lands on a new post that does not sit on an existing adequate footing, a **new pad footing** must be constructed
- A pad footing is a reinforced concrete pad poured beneath the post to distribute the point load to the soil
- The engineer specifies:
  - Footing dimensions (e.g., 600mm x 600mm x 300mm deep --- varies by load and soil)
  - Concrete grade (typically N20 or N25)
  - Reinforcement (e.g., SL72 mesh or N12 bars)
  - Depth below ground (per AS 2870 --- Residential Slabs and Footings)
- **Soil conditions matter:** Clay soils (common in Melbourne, Adelaide, parts of Sydney) may require deeper or larger footings due to reactive soil movement. Sandy soils (Perth coastal, parts of QLD) may allow smaller footings but require adequate bearing depth.
- If the home is on a concrete slab, the engineer will assess whether the existing slab can support the point load or whether it needs to be cut and a new footing poured beneath

**Typical pad footing costs:**

| Item | Typical Cost (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Excavation (per footing) | $150 -- $400 |
| Concrete supply and pour (per footing) | $200 -- $500 |
| Reinforcement | $50 -- $150 |
| Formwork | $50 -- $150 |
| **Total per pad footing** | **$450 -- $1,200** |

#### 4.2.5 Building Certification / Inspection

- The building certifier (private certifier or council) must inspect the structural work at mandatory stages (see Section 6 below)
- Key inspection points for beam installation:
  - **Footing inspection** --- after excavation, before concrete is poured (if new footings required)
  - **Frame / structural inspection** --- after beam, posts, and connections are installed, before they are covered/clad
  - **Final inspection** --- at completion of all work
- The structural engineer may also conduct their own inspection and issue a compliance/completion certificate

#### 4.2.6 Typical Total Cost Ranges for Load-Bearing Wall Removal + Beam Installation

| Scope | Typical Cost Range (AUD) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple single-storey, short span (up to 3m)** | $3,000 -- $6,000 | Includes engineer, beam, installation, basic make-good |
| **Standard single-storey, medium span (3--5m)** | $5,000 -- $10,000 | May require new footings; standard residential |
| **Complex / long span (5m+) or two-storey** | $8,000 -- $15,000+ | Larger beam, possibly multiple posts, complex propping |
| **Multi-wall removal / open plan conversion** | $10,000 -- $25,000+ | Multiple beams, extensive structural modification |

**Breakdown of typical costs within a standard project:**

| Component | Typical Cost (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Structural engineer (design + certification) | $800 -- $2,500 |
| Building permit / CDC | $500 -- $1,500 |
| Steel beam (supply) | $500 -- $2,000 |
| Temporary propping | $200 -- $600 |
| Demolition of wall | $500 -- $1,500 |
| Beam installation labour | $800 -- $2,500 |
| Posts and connections | $300 -- $1,000 |
| New pad footings (if required, per footing) | $450 -- $1,200 |
| Service relocations (electrical, plumbing) | $500 -- $2,000 |
| Make-good (plaster, paint, flooring patch) | $500 -- $2,500 |
| Waste removal | $200 -- $500 |

## 5. Council Approval for Structural Work

### 5.1 Overview

In Australia, removing or modifying a load-bearing wall is **not exempt development** in any state or territory. Some form of building approval is always required for structural work. The approval pathway and terminology differ by state.

### 5.2 Approval Pathways: DA vs CDC vs Building Permit

| Term | Meaning | Used In |
|---|---|---|
| **Development Application (DA)** | A formal application to the local council for planning approval. Assessed on individual merits. Longer processing time (typically 4--12 weeks, can be longer). | NSW, QLD, WA, SA, ACT |
| **Complying Development Certificate (CDC)** | A streamlined approval for work that meets pre-set standards (SEPP codes). Can be issued by a private certifier. Faster (typically 10--20 business days). | NSW (primary), some adoption in other states |
| **Building Permit (BP)** | A permit confirming the work complies with the Building Code (NCC). Required in addition to or instead of a DA/CDC, depending on the state. | VIC, WA, TAS, NT, ACT |
| **Building Rules Consent** | SA equivalent of a building permit --- confirms compliance with the Building Code. | SA |
| **Construction Certificate (CC)** | In NSW, required after a DA is approved and before construction begins. Confirms detailed plans comply with BCA/NCC. | NSW |

### 5.3 State-by-State Requirements for Internal Load-Bearing Wall Removal

| State/Territory | Approval Required? | Approval Pathway | Key Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Yes | CDC (most common for internal structural work) or DA + CC | Internal structural wall removal typically qualifies for a **CDC** under the Codes SEPP, issued by a private certifier. A DA is needed if the work does not meet CDC criteria (e.g., heritage-listed home, flood zone). Structural engineer drawings required. |
| **VIC** | Yes | Building Permit | A **building permit** from a Registered Building Surveyor (RBS) is required. The RBS can be private or council-employed. Structural engineer drawings and a **Regulation 126 Certificate of Compliance (design)** from the engineer are required. No separate planning permit needed for internal-only work (unless heritage overlay applies). |
| **QLD** | Yes | Building Approval (BA) | A **building approval** is required from a private building certifier or council. The certifier requires structural engineer drawings, a **Form 15** compliance certificate for the design, and will issue a **Form 16** inspection certificate at completion. A separate planning (DA) approval is generally **not** required for internal-only structural work unless it changes the building's use or external appearance. |
| **WA** | Yes | Building Permit (BA1 Certified or BA2 Uncertified) | A **building permit** is required under the Building Act 2011. For structural work, a **BA1 (Certified)** application with a certificate of design compliance from a registered building surveyor is recommended. Processing time: 10 business days. Structural engineer certification required. |
| **SA** | Yes | Building Rules Consent | **Building Rules Consent** is required, issued by council or a private certifier. Structural engineer drawings and certification are required. A separate planning consent is generally not needed for internal-only work. |
| **TAS** | Yes | Building Permit (risk-based) | Tasmania uses a **risk-based** system. Removal of non-load-bearing walls may be "low risk" (no permit needed). Removal of load-bearing walls is classified as higher risk and requires assessment by a licensed building surveyor, potentially a full building permit. |
| **ACT** | Yes | Building Approval (BA) | A **building approval** is required. A DA may also be required depending on the scope. If the work meets the exemption criteria under the Planning and Development Code 2008, a DA may not be needed, but a BA is always required for structural work. |
| **NT** | Yes | Building Permit | A **building permit** from a registered building certifier is required. The NT uses a two-tier system: Tier 1 areas (Darwin, Alice Springs, Lake Bennett) require full certification; Tier 2 areas have reduced requirements. Structural engineer certification is required in Tier 1 areas. |

### 5.4 Key Takeaways for Scope-of-Works

- **Every state requires some form of building approval for structural wall removal.** There is no state where this work is exempt.
- In **NSW**, the CDC pathway via a private certifier is the fastest and most common route for straightforward internal wall removal.
- In **VIC**, a private RBS (Registered Building Surveyor) is functionally equivalent to a private certifier in other states.
- In **QLD**, the private building certifier pathway with Form 15/Form 16 is standard.
- **Heritage overlays, flood zones, bushfire zones, and strata/unit titles** can complicate the approval pathway in any state and may require a full DA.
- **Strata properties** (apartments, townhouses) typically also require strata/body corporate approval in addition to building approval.
- **Typical approval costs:** $500 -- $1,500 for a CDC or building permit; $1,500 -- $5,000+ for a full DA.

## 6. Building Certification

### 6.1 Who Inspects Structural Work?

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Private Certifier / Principal Certifier (NSW) / RBS (VIC) / Building Certifier (QLD, WA, SA, TAS, NT, ACT)** | A licensed professional who issues the building permit/CDC and conducts mandatory inspections during construction. They confirm the work complies with the NCC and approved plans. |
| **Structural Engineer** | The design engineer may conduct their own inspection of the completed structural work and issue a compliance certificate confirming it was built per their design. This is often required by the certifier. |
| **Council building inspector** | In some cases (particularly if council issued the permit, or for random audits), a council officer may inspect. Less common when a private certifier is appointed. |

### 6.2 Private Certifier vs Council

| Factor | Private Certifier | Council |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | Faster --- typically 10--20 business days for CDC/permit | Slower --- can be 4--12+ weeks |
| **Cost** | Varies; often comparable or slightly higher than council fees | Set by council fee schedule |
| **Flexibility** | Can be more responsive; you choose who to appoint | Assigned by council; less choice |
| **Availability** | Available in all states for residential work | Always available as a fallback |
| **Legal standing** | Same legal authority as council for building compliance | Full statutory authority |
| **Recommended for** | Most straightforward residential structural work | Heritage properties, complex DAs, or where council-specific knowledge is needed |

### 6.3 Mandatory Inspections for Structural Work

The specific mandatory inspection stages vary by state but generally align with the following:

#### NSW --- Critical Stage Inspections

Under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000, the Principal Certifier must inspect at:

1. **After excavation** for footings, before concrete is poured
2. **After placement of reinforcement** for slabs/footings, before concrete is poured
3. **After installation of framing** (including structural beams), before covering with lining
4. **Final inspection** before an Occupation Certificate is issued

An Occupation Certificate **cannot** be issued if a mandatory inspection was missed.

#### VIC --- Mandatory Notification Stages

Under Building Regulations 2018:

1. **Footing stage** --- after excavation, before concrete pour
2. **Frame stage** --- after structural frame/beam installation, before lining
3. **Final inspection**

The RBS must conduct all inspections **in person** and may add additional inspection stages as conditions of the building permit.

#### QLD --- Building Inspection Stages

Under Building Regulation 2021:

1. **Excavation** --- after excavation, before concrete pour
2. **Footings** --- after formwork and reinforcement, before concrete pour
3. **Slab** --- after formwork and reinforcement, before concrete pour (if applicable)
4. **Frame** --- after structural framing and beam installation
5. **Final** --- completion inspection

The building certifier issues a **Form 16 (Inspection Certificate)** at each stage.

#### WA --- Inspection Stages

1. **Footing / foundation** --- before concrete pour
2. **Frame** --- after structural work, before lining
3. **Final** --- completion

#### SA --- Inspection Stages

1. **Footing** --- before concrete pour
2. **Frame** --- before covering
3. **Final** --- at completion

A private certifier or council conducts inspections.

#### TAS --- Risk-Based Inspections

- Inspection stages depend on the risk category assigned by the building surveyor
- Structural work will typically require footing, frame, and final inspections

#### ACT --- Inspection Stages

- Inspections are specified on the building approval
- Typically include footing, frame, and final stages for structural work

#### NT --- Inspection Stages

- Building certifier specifies mandatory inspection stages on the building permit
- Tier 1 areas (Darwin, Alice Springs) require full inspection regime
- Typically include footing, frame, and final stages

### 6.4 Summary of Inspections for a Typical Load-Bearing Wall Removal

For a standard single-storey load-bearing wall removal with beam installation, the following inspections are typically required:

| Stage | When | Who Inspects | What They Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Footing inspection** (if new footings) | After excavation and reinforcement placement, before concrete pour | Building certifier | Footing dimensions, depth, reinforcement, soil conditions match engineer's design |
| **Structural / frame inspection** | After beam, posts, and connections are installed; before plasterboard lining is applied | Building certifier + structural engineer (compliance cert) | Beam size matches drawings, connections correct, posts plumb, no damage to beam, bracing adequate |
| **Final inspection** | After all work complete (lining, painting, services reinstated) | Building certifier | Overall compliance, all prior inspection items addressed, completion certificate issued |

### 6.5 Certification Costs

| Item | Typical Cost (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Private certifier --- CDC issue (NSW) | $800 -- $2,000 |
| Private certifier --- building permit (VIC, QLD, WA) | $500 -- $1,500 |
| Mandatory inspections (typically 2--3 visits) | Often included in certifier fee, or $200 -- $400 per visit |
| Structural engineer completion certificate | $400 -- $800 |
| Occupation certificate (NSW) / final certificate | Typically included in certifier fee |

12. Steel beam --- delivery and handling
13. Steel beam --- installation and fixing to posts/columns
14. Steel posts/columns --- supply and install (size per engineer's specification)
15. Connection hardware --- base plates, bolts, brackets, anchor bolts
16. Structural / frame inspection by certifier (before lining)
17. Structural engineer --- completion inspection and compliance certificate
18. Temporary propping --- removal
19. Beam and post wrapping/cladding (plasterboard for fire rating and finish)
20. Make-good --- plastering, cornice, painting, flooring patch
21. Final inspection by certifier
```

## Confidence Assessment

| Topic | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
