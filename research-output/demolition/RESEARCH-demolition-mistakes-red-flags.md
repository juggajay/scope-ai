## 1. Attempting Demolition Without an Asbestos Check

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners begin demolition work (ripping out walls, ceilings, flooring, wet areas) without first having a qualified assessor test for asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). This is the single most dangerous mistake a homeowner can make during a renovation.

### Why It Is Dangerous

- **1-in-3 Australian homes contain asbestos.** Any home built before 1990 is likely to contain asbestos in some form, including fibro sheeting, vinyl flooring, ceiling tiles, insulation, eaves, fencing, and bathroom/laundry linings.
- Asbestos fibres are invisible to the naked eye. When disturbed through cutting, drilling, sanding, breaking, or demolishing, microscopic fibres become airborne and can be inhaled.
- There is **no safe level of asbestos exposure.** Even brief exposure during activities like drilling or sanding in an older home can cause disease decades later.
- Australia has the **second-highest mesothelioma death rate in the world**, behind only the United Kingdom.
- **Over 4,000 Australians die each year** from asbestos-related diseases, with more than 700 of those deaths specifically from mesothelioma.
- A 2025 study found that **89% of mesothelioma patients reported possible or probable asbestos exposure in non-occupational settings**, of which **51% were exposed during major home renovations involving asbestos** and 38% from living in a house while renovations were underway.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **Before any demolition begins**, engage a licensed asbestos assessor to inspect the property and collect samples.
2. Have samples tested at a NATA-accredited laboratory. Lab testing costs between $40 and $140 per sample (NSW Government data). A full inspection typically costs $400 to $900 depending on property size.
3. If asbestos is found, engage a licensed asbestos removalist (Class A for friable asbestos, Class B for bonded/non-friable asbestos).
4. Do not proceed with any demolition in areas where asbestos is confirmed or suspected until removal is complete and clearance is issued.

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Health** | Mesothelioma (incurable cancer), asbestosis (chronic lung scarring), lung cancer. Latency period of 20-50 years means symptoms appear decades after exposure. |
| **Legal fines (NSW)** | Up to $1,000,000 for individuals if asbestos matters go to court. Tier 2 offences: up to $4 million for companies, $2 million for individuals. |
| **Legal fines (VIC)** | Up to $30,000 for individuals, significantly more for businesses. |
| **Legal fines (SA)** | Up to $500,000 or 4 years imprisonment for individuals; up to $2 million for corporate bodies. |
| **Legal fines (QLD)** | On-the-spot fines apply for various asbestos breaches; court-imposed penalties can be substantially higher. |
| **Contamination cleanup** | A home renovation involving asbestos remediation typically costs $20,000 to $50,000 including testing, removal, disposal, and required safety checks. Costs can escalate dramatically if contamination has spread through the home. |
| **Asbestos testing (comparison)** | A pre-demolition asbestos test costs $400-$900. Remediation after illegal disturbance costs $20,000-$50,000+. The test is roughly 1-2% of the potential cleanup cost. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> If the property was built before 1990, the scope-of-works generator **must** include an asbestos inspection as a mandatory prerequisite line item before any demolition work commences.

## 2. Assuming All Walls Are Non-Load-Bearing

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners (or unqualified tradespeople) remove a wall assuming it is a simple partition, when it is actually a load-bearing wall supporting the roof structure, upper floors, or other critical structural elements.

### Why It Is Dangerous

- Removing a load-bearing wall without implementing appropriate load redistribution measures can result in **structural instability**, including sagging ceilings, uneven or sinking floors, cracking in walls and ceilings, and in the worst case, **partial or total collapse** of the structure.
- Weakened floor joists above a removed load-bearing wall can cause excessive deflection, sinking floors, or structural failure.
- The damage may not be immediately apparent. Structural failure can develop over weeks, months, or years as the remaining structure slowly shifts under loads it was never designed to carry alone.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **Engage a structural engineer** before removing any wall. A structural engineer will confirm whether the wall is load-bearing, design an appropriate beam (steel or timber) to redistribute the load, and specify temporary propping requirements during removal.
2. **Obtain building approval.** The removal of load-bearing walls requires a building permit in all Australian states and territories. This includes structural engineering certification.
3. **Use a licensed builder** to carry out the work. In Victoria, any building job over $10,000 must be completed by a licensed builder.

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Structural failure** | Sagging ceilings, cracked walls, uneven floors. In extreme cases, roof collapse or floor failure. |
| **Safety risk** | The December 2025 Brisbane retaining wall collapse killed one man and trapped a 19-year-old for 90 minutes with serious injuries, illustrating the lethal potential of structural failures on building sites. |
| **Insurance voided** | Building/contents insurers are unlikely to cover damage resulting from unpermitted structural modifications. |
| **Sale complications** | Unpermitted wall removals can be discovered during pre-purchase building inspections, causing sales to fall through or requiring expensive rectification before settlement. |
| **Council enforcement** | Councils can impose fines, require reinstatement of the wall, and issue stop-work orders. |
| **Rectification costs** | Fixing a botched load-bearing wall removal (installing a steel beam after the fact, repairing cracked plaster, re-levelling floors) can cost $10,000 to $50,000+ depending on severity, compared to $2,000-$5,000 for a structural engineer's design and proper removal from the outset. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> Any wall removal must include a line item: "Structural engineer to confirm wall is non-load-bearing, or provide beam design if load-bearing." This should be a mandatory prerequisite before wall demolition is scoped.

---

## 3. Underestimating Skip Bin Size

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners order a skip bin that is too small for the volume of demolition waste generated, resulting in overflowing bins, multiple bin exchanges, and significantly higher total waste disposal costs.

### Why It Is Costly

- Demolition generates far more waste than most homeowners expect. A single bathroom demolition can fill a 4m3 bin. A full kitchen demolition with cabinetry, tiling, and plasterboard can easily require 6-8m3.
- Ordering a bin that is too small means paying for a second (or third) delivery and collection. Each bin exchange incurs a full delivery/pickup fee.
- Placing prohibited waste types (such as asbestos) in a general skip bin will incur fines and additional charges for safe removal.
- Overloading a bin above the fill line means the bin company will refuse to collect it until excess waste is removed, causing project delays.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **When in doubt, size up.** A single larger bin is almost always cheaper than two smaller bins. The cost of multiple drop-offs and pick-ups makes undersizing a false economy.
2. **Use this general guide for sizing:**

| Project | Recommended Bin Size |
|---|---|
| Bathroom renovation demo | 4m3 - 6m3 |
| Kitchen renovation demo | 6m3 - 8m3 |
| Multi-room renovation | 8m3 - 10m3 |
| Full house strip-out | 10m3+ (possibly multiple bins) |

3. **Separate waste streams** where possible. Mixed waste (heavy + light) costs more to dispose of. Some companies offer cheaper rates for single-material loads (e.g., clean concrete, clean timber).

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Cost of getting it wrong** | A 4m3 skip averages $500-$600 in Sydney. If you need two because you undersized, that is $1,000-$1,200. An 8m3 skip averages $700-$900 -- saving $100-$300 by sizing correctly. |
| **Total cost range** | Skip bin hire across Australia ranges from $350 to $2,000+ depending on size and duration. |
| **Project delays** | Waiting for a second bin delivery can delay demolition by 1-3 days, which cascades into trade scheduling delays. |
| **Prohibited waste penalties** | Placing asbestos or hazardous materials in a general skip will result in fines plus the cost of safe removal of all contaminated contents. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> The scope-of-works generator should auto-calculate estimated waste volume based on the rooms being demolished and recommend a skip bin size. Include a note: "We recommend sizing up one bin size from your estimate to avoid costly exchanges."

## 4. Forgetting Site Protection

### What the Mistake Is

Demolition begins without protecting finished surfaces that are being retained -- hardwood floors, stairs, benchtops, bathtubs, shower screens, windows, and door frames. Debris, tools, boots, and dust damage these surfaces during the demolition process.

### Why It Is Costly

- Repairing scratched or gouged hardwood floors costs **$50-$100 per scratch** for minor damage, or **$200-$500 per board** for deep gouges, or **$30-$60 per square metre** for sanding and refinishing an entire floor (Melbourne pricing).
- Specialist timber floor repairers charge $40-$80 per hour.
- Premium Australian hardwoods (Spotted Gum, Blackbutt, Jarrah) are more expensive to repair due to higher material costs.
- A single dropped demolition tool or dragged piece of debris can cause hundreds of dollars in floor damage. A full day of unprotected demolition can require thousands in floor restoration.
- Replacing a cracked stone benchtop that was being retained can cost $2,000-$5,000+. Replacing a chipped bathtub can cost $1,500-$3,000+.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **Lay floor protection before any demolition work begins.** Options include:
   - Corrugated cardboard sheets (e.g., Corri-Board 350gsm) for general traffic and light debris protection
   - Ram Board or similar heavy-duty protection for high-traffic demolition zones
   - Peel-off protective coatings (e.g., Goop) for benchtops, bathtubs, windows, and other hard surfaces
   - Thick plastic sheeting taped down for dust containment
2. **Protect stairs** with carpet offcuts or dedicated stair protection if they are a traffic path for waste removal.
3. **Protect retained benchtops** with cardboard and plywood sheeting.
4. **Establish designated walkways** through the site. Keeping foot traffic to defined paths means you only need to protect those paths heavily, rather than every surface.
5. **Use sticky mats** at entry points to reduce dust and debris tracked through the home.

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Floor protection cost** | $200-$500 for materials to protect a typical renovation zone. |
| **Floor repair cost (if unprotected)** | $1,000-$5,000+ depending on extent of damage and timber species. |
| **Benchtop replacement** | $2,000-$5,000+ for stone benchtops. |
| **Bathtub replacement** | $1,500-$3,000+ including removal and reinstallation. |
| **Return on investment** | Spending $300 on protection to avoid $3,000 in repairs is a 10:1 return. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> Every demolition scope should include a "Site Protection" line item listing the surfaces to be protected and the protection method. This should appear before any demolition line items in the scope sequence.

## 5. Not Disconnecting Services Before Demo Starts

### What the Mistake Is

Demolition work commences without first disconnecting or isolating electricity, gas, water supply, drainage, and telecommunications. Workers then strike live electrical cables, cut into pressurised water pipes, or damage gas lines during demolition.

### Why It Is Dangerous

- **Electricity:** Hitting live wiring during demolition can cause electric shock (potentially fatal), electrical fires, and damage to the home's electrical system. Even 240V domestic wiring can kill.
- **Gas:** Damaging a gas line can cause gas leaks leading to explosions and fires. A gas explosion can destroy an entire home and damage neighbouring properties.
- **Water:** Cutting into a pressurised water pipe causes flooding, water damage to retained areas of the home, and potential damage to electrical systems if water contacts live wiring.
- **Sewer/drainage:** Damaging sewer lines creates contamination, health hazards, and expensive repairs.
- **Telecommunications/NBN:** Cutting fibre or copper lines disrupts services and incurs reconnection costs.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **Contact each service provider in writing** to request disconnection or isolation, at least **2-4 weeks before demolition is scheduled**, as disconnections can take up to 28 days to arrange.
2. **Services to disconnect/isolate:**
   - Electricity (via your electricity retailer or distributor -- e.g., Ausgrid, Endeavour Energy, Energex)
   - Gas (via your gas provider)
   - Water supply (via your water authority -- e.g., Sydney Water, Melbourne Water, SA Water)
   - Sewer/drainage
   - Telecommunications/NBN
3. **Councils typically require written confirmation** that all utilities have been disconnected before demolition can legally proceed.
4. **Most demolition companies** will either arrange disconnections on your behalf or advise you on exactly what needs to be submitted. Ask your demolition contractor about this during the quoting stage.
5. If only doing a partial renovation (not full house demo), have an electrician isolate circuits to the demolition area and a plumber cap off water supply to that zone. Do not rely on simply turning off a tap or flipping a breaker -- have it properly isolated and verified.

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Electrocution** | 240V domestic wiring is potentially fatal. Even non-fatal shocks can cause serious burns and cardiac issues. |
| **Gas explosion** | Gas leaks from damaged lines can accumulate and ignite, causing explosions that destroy homes and endanger neighbours. |
| **Water damage** | A burst pipe during demolition can flood retained areas, damaging flooring, cabinetry, and electrical systems. Water damage restoration can cost $5,000-$20,000+. |
| **Service disruption** | Damaging utility lines can disrupt services to neighbouring properties, creating liability. |
| **Project delays** | Emergency repairs to damaged services can delay the project by days or weeks. |
| **Legal liability** | The property owner holds a duty of care. Failing to disconnect services before demolition can result in liability claims from injured workers or affected neighbours. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> The scope-of-works generator should include "Service Disconnection/Isolation" as a mandatory prerequisite section, listing each service type with a checkbox. This must appear before demolition line items and include a note about lead times (2-4 weeks).

## 6. DIY Demolition: What Is Safe and What Is Not

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners attempt demolition tasks themselves that should only be performed by licensed professionals, exposing themselves to serious safety risks, legal liability, and insurance complications.

### What Is Generally Safe for Homeowners to DIY

The following tasks are generally considered safe for a competent homeowner, provided appropriate safety equipment is worn (safety glasses, dust mask, gloves, steel-toed boots, hearing protection):

- **Removing carpet and underlay** (watch for tack strips; gripper rods have sharp nails)
- **Removing non-fixed furniture and fittings** (freestanding items, curtains, blinds)
- **Removing light fittings** -- but ONLY after the power has been switched off **at the switchboard** (not just the wall switch), and ideally verified dead with a voltage tester
- **Removing timber skirting boards and architraves** (provided no asbestos is present behind them)
- **Removing non-structural timber panelling** (confirmed non-asbestos, confirmed non-load-bearing)
- **Removing tiles from walls or floors** -- but ONLY if confirmed to not contain asbestos in the tile, adhesive, or substrate beneath

### What Is NOT Safe for Homeowners to DIY

The following tasks **must** be performed by licensed professionals:

| Task | Required Professional | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Anything involving asbestos** | Licensed asbestos removalist (Class A or B) | Health risk, legal requirement. Unlicensed removal is illegal in all states. |
| **Electrical work** | Licensed electrician | DIY electrical work is illegal in all Australian states and territories. |
| **Plumbing work** | Licensed plumber | DIY plumbing is illegal. Faulty plumbing can cause flooding, contamination, and structural damage. |
| **Gas work** | Licensed gasfitter | DIY gas work is illegal. Gas leaks can cause explosions and carbon monoxide poisoning. |
| **Structural demolition** (load-bearing walls, beams, columns) | Licensed builder + structural engineer | Risk of structural collapse. Requires engineering design and building permit. |
| **Roof removal** | Licensed builder/demolition contractor | Fall risk (leading cause of construction deaths in Australia), structural complexity. |
| **Tree removal near structures** | Qualified arborist | Risk of property damage, power line strikes, personal injury. |

### Insurance Implications of DIY Demolition

This is a critical area that most homeowners do not understand:

1. **Home insurance policies may be voided** if the insurer is not notified of renovation works before they commence.
2. **DIY electrical work can void your home insurance entirely.** Most policies require all electrical work to be carried out by a licensed tradesperson. If a fire results from DIY wiring, the insurer can refuse the claim.
3. **Unlicensed structural work** (removing load-bearing walls without engineering and permits) can void both building insurance and contents insurance. If the home suffers structural damage later, the insurer can refuse coverage.
4. **DIY renovators may need additional insurance.** Standard home and contents policies typically do not cover homeowners undertaking their own renovations. Separate "renovator's insurance" or "owner-builder insurance" may be required.
5. **If the renovation value exceeds $50,000**, standard home policies may not provide full coverage regardless of who does the work.
6. **If the property is left vacant for more than 60 days** during renovation (common during major works), most home insurance policies become void.

### What Should Be Done Instead

- Do the safe DIY tasks listed above to save money on your demolition costs.
- Engage licensed professionals for everything else.
- **Notify your insurer** before starting any renovation work.
- Check whether your policy covers renovation activities or whether you need additional coverage.
- Keep records of all licensed tradespeople used, including licence numbers and certificates of insurance.

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> The scope generator should clearly separate "Homeowner prep tasks" (safe DIY) from "Licensed demolition tasks" (professional only). Each professional task should note the required licence type.

## 7. Disposing of Asbestos Illegally

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners (or unscrupulous contractors) dispose of asbestos waste by placing it in general skip bins, domestic rubbish bins, council kerbside collections, or by illegally dumping it on vacant land, roadways, or in bushland.

### Why It Is Dangerous and Illegal

- Asbestos fibres contaminate any environment they are dumped in. They do not break down naturally and remain hazardous indefinitely.
- Illegal dumping contaminates soil and waterways, creating ongoing public health risks.
- General waste facilities (tips) are not equipped to handle asbestos. It must go to a licensed asbestos disposal facility.
- It is **illegal to place asbestos in a domestic rubbish bin** (NSW Health).
- It is **illegal to place asbestos in a general skip bin.** If asbestos is discovered in a general skip, the entire bin contents must be treated as contaminated waste, dramatically increasing disposal costs.
- It is **illegal to water-blast asbestos cement materials** (NSW Health).

### Proper Disposal Process

1. **Wrapping:** Asbestos waste must be double-wrapped in polyethylene (polythene) sheeting approximately 200 microns (0.2mm) thick, securely sealed with strong adhesive tape.
2. **Dust/small pieces:** Asbestos dust must be contained in double polythene bags (max 1200mm x 900mm), wetted before sealing, filled no more than half full, and not exceeding 30kg per bag. Bags should be tied tightly with the neck folded over and secured with tape.
3. **Labelling:** All packages must be clearly labelled with "CAUTION -- ASBESTOS WASTE" in large, legible letters using a permanent marker, or have asbestos-warning stickers applied. The standard asbestos hazard symbol should also be displayed.
4. **Transport:** Asbestos waste must be transported in a covered or enclosed vehicle. It must not be compacted, broken up, or allowed to become airborne during transport.
5. **Disposal facility:** Asbestos can only be disposed of at a **licensed asbestos disposal facility.** You must call ahead and pre-book, as most facilities only accept asbestos at specific times. The Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency maintains a national map of licensed disposal facilities at asbestossafety.gov.au.
6. **Notification:** In most states, asbestos removal above certain thresholds requires notification to the relevant Work Health and Safety regulator (e.g., SafeWork NSW, WorkSafe Victoria).

### Real-World Prosecution Cases

| Case | Jurisdiction | Penalty |
|---|---|---|
| Man caught by covert EPA surveillance illegally dumping building waste containing asbestos at Rossmore | NSW | $200,000 fine, plus $30,000 for lying to the EPA during investigation |
| Truck driver illegally dumped 3.6 tonnes of waste containing asbestos at Clemton Park | NSW | $27,200 fine + $23,000 costs |
| Former owner of Bowral Landfill deposited 14,000+ tonnes of undocumented asbestos waste | NSW | $263,000 fine |
| Steven Cutts (SC Roofing and Cladding) illegal asbestos removal | SA | $84,000 initial fine (reduced to $67,200 after discount) |
| Asbestos dumping caught by drone in Western Sydney | NSW | Second conviction secured; penalties under legislation allow up to $10 million for companies |
| EPA fine for exposed asbestos | VIC | $25,000 fine |

### Maximum Penalty Framework by State

| State | Individuals | Companies |
|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Up to $2 million (Tier 2 offences) | Up to $10 million |
| **VIC** | Up to $30,000+ | Significantly higher |
| **QLD** | On-the-spot fines plus court-imposed penalties | Higher for organisations |
| **SA** | Up to $500,000 or 4 years imprisonment | Up to $2 million |
| **General (WHS Act)** | Up to $600,000 | Up to $3 million |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> If asbestos is identified (or the property is pre-1990 and untested), the scope must include an "Asbestos Removal & Disposal" section with explicit line items for licensed removal, double-wrapping, labelling, transport, and disposal at a licensed facility. The scope should never allow asbestos waste to be included in general demolition waste lines.

---

## 8. Not Getting Multiple Quotes

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners accept the first demolition quote they receive without comparing it against other quotes. This leads to overpaying, missing scope items, and engaging contractors who may not be appropriately licensed or insured.

### Why It Is Costly

- Demolition quotes can vary by 30-50% or more between contractors for the same scope of work.
- A single quote provides no benchmark. You cannot know if the price is fair, high, or suspiciously low without comparison.
- Suspiciously low quotes often indicate that the contractor is cutting corners -- omitting asbestos handling, not including proper waste disposal, using unlicensed workers, or lacking adequate insurance.
- High quotes may include unnecessary work or inflated margins.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **Obtain at least 3 quotes** from different licensed contractors (this is the recommendation from the QBCC and NSW Fair Trading).
2. **Provide identical information** to all contractors so quotes are comparable (same scope, same rooms, same level of detail).
3. **Insist on a site visit.** Any contractor quoting demolition without visiting the site is guessing. A site visit allows them to assess access, identify hazards, and provide an accurate price.
4. **Check what each quote includes and excludes.** Key items to compare:

| Check Item | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| **Scope of work** | Exactly what is being demolished, room by room |
| **Asbestos** | Is testing included? Is removal included or excluded? |
| **Waste disposal** | Is it included? What bin size? How many bins? |
| **Site protection** | Is floor/surface protection included? |
| **Service isolation** | Is disconnection of electricity/gas/water included or the homeowner's responsibility? |
| **Permits** | Is the contractor obtaining required permits, or is that the homeowner's responsibility? |
| **Make-good** | Does the quote include making good (patching, capping pipes, etc.) after demo? |
| **Insurance** | Does the contractor have public liability insurance ($5M+ minimum recommended)? |
| **Licence** | Does the contractor hold a current demolition licence for the scope of work? |
| **Timeline** | Start date, estimated duration, completion date |

5. **Verify the contractor's licence** using your state's online register (e.g., QBCC licence register in QLD, NSW Fair Trading licence check in NSW).
6. **Check disciplinary history** -- QBCC and other state registers show any enforcement actions or complaints.
7. **Understand deposit limits.** In Queensland, legal deposit limits are:
   - Jobs over $20,000: maximum 5% deposit
   - Jobs $3,300 to $19,999: maximum 10% deposit
   - Jobs under $3,300: maximum 20% deposit

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Overpaying** | Without comparison, homeowners routinely pay 20-40% more than necessary. |
| **Incomplete scope** | A cheap quote that excludes asbestos handling or waste disposal can end up costing far more once those items are added as variations. |
| **Unlicensed work** | Engaging an unlicensed contractor means no consumer protection, no warranty, and no recourse if things go wrong. |
| **Insurance gaps** | If the contractor has no public liability insurance and damages your property or a neighbour's property, you may be liable. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> The AI scope generator should produce a detailed, itemised scope that homeowners can provide to multiple contractors for like-for-like quoting. The output should include a "Quote Comparison Checklist" section.

## 9. Starting Demolition Before Approvals Are in Place

### What the Mistake Is

Homeowners (or their contractors) begin demolition work before obtaining the required council development approvals (DA), complying development certificates (CDC), building permits, or demolition permits. This is sometimes done out of ignorance ("I didn't know I needed a permit for internal demo") and sometimes deliberately to save time.

### Why It Is Dangerous and Costly

- **Stop-work orders** can be issued immediately by council inspectors, halting your project indefinitely until compliance is achieved.
- Councils may require you to **reinstate** (rebuild) anything demolished without approval, at your own cost.
- Fines are substantial and vary by state (see below).
- Proceeding without approval can affect the **validity of your home insurance policy.**
- Unapproved work can create problems when **selling the property**, as pre-purchase building inspections may reveal non-compliant alterations, causing buyers to withdraw or demand significant price reductions.
- Non-compliant work may need to be **demolished and redone** to obtain retrospective approval, doubling costs.

### What Should Be Done Instead

1. **Check with your local council** before starting any demolition work. Requirements vary by council and by the type of work.
2. **Understand the approval types:**
   - **Exempt development:** Some minor internal demolition (e.g., removing non-structural internal walls in certain circumstances) may not require approval. But this varies by state and council.
   - **Complying Development Certificate (CDC):** A fast-track approval for work that meets specific predetermined standards. Can be issued by a private certifier.
   - **Development Application (DA):** Required for more significant work, particularly anything affecting the external appearance, heritage items, or structural elements.
   - **Demolition permit/notification:** Some states require specific notification or permits for demolition work, separate from the DA.
3. **Obtain written confirmation** of what approvals are required before commencing.
4. **Keep all approval documents on-site** during demolition in case of council inspection.

### Fines and Penalties by State

| State | Individual Penalty | Corporate Penalty | Additional |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Up to $1 million | Up to $5 million | Under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act |
| **VIC** | Up to ~$99,000 (500 penalty units) | Higher | Unpermitted demolitions |
| **SA** | Up to $120,000 | Higher | Plus default penalty of $500/day until resolved |
| **QLD** | Significant fines | Higher for companies | Plus potential requirement to reinstate |

### Real-World Consequences

| Consequence | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Stop-work order** | Project halted indefinitely. Trades already booked must be rescheduled (often at a cost). Materials already ordered may incur storage fees. |
| **Reinstatement order** | Council can order you to rebuild what was demolished. This is the nightmare scenario -- paying to demolish and then paying again to rebuild the same thing. |
| **Insurance voided** | Work done without required approvals may not be covered by your home insurance. If a fire or structural issue results from unapproved work, claims can be denied. |
| **Sale complications** | Unapproved work must be disclosed or rectified before sale. Retrospective approval (if even possible) can cost $5,000-$20,000+ in consultant fees, application fees, and potential rectification work. |
| **Daily penalties** | In SA, a default penalty of up to $500 per day can apply until the offence is rectified. |

### AI Scope Generator Flag

> The scope-of-works generator should include an "Approvals & Permits" prerequisite section at the top of every demolition scope. It should flag when a DA, CDC, or demolition permit is likely required based on the scope of work described.

## 10. Other Common Mistakes

### 10.1 Starting Demolition Before the Design Is Finalised

**What it is:** Homeowners begin demolition before the renovation design, floor plan, joinery layouts, lighting design, and material selections are fully resolved and locked in.

**Why it is costly:** Without a clear plan, decisions get made on the fly during construction. Power outlets end up in the wrong place, material choices are rushed, and unnecessary variations are required. Mid-build layout changes cost extra time and money -- almost always more than getting the design right before demolition.

**What should be done instead:** Engage a designer or architect early. Have the full design locked in, including electrical plans, plumbing layouts, and material specifications, before any demolition begins. The cost of design is a fraction of the cost of fixing mid-build changes.

### 10.2 Not Notifying Neighbours

**What it is:** Failing to inform neighbours that demolition work is about to take place.

**Why it is costly:** Demolition is noisy, dusty, and disruptive. Failure to notify neighbours can result in noise complaints to council, disputes, and in some cases council-imposed restrictions on work hours. Some councils require formal neighbour notification as part of the approval process.

**What should be done instead:** Notify adjacent neighbours in person or in writing at least 1-2 weeks before demolition begins. Include expected start date, duration, work hours, and a contact number for the site supervisor. This is a courtesy that prevents disputes and demonstrates good faith.

### 10.3 Ignoring Hazardous Materials Beyond Asbestos

**What it is:** Focusing only on asbestos while ignoring other hazardous materials commonly found in older Australian homes, including lead paint, synthetic mineral fibres (SMF), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs in old electrical equipment), and mould.

**Why it is dangerous:** Lead paint dust is toxic, particularly to children. Mould spores can spread through the entire house if disturbed during demolition. PCBs are carcinogenic.

**What should be done instead:** A comprehensive hazardous materials survey (not just asbestos) should be conducted before demolition of pre-1970s homes. If lead paint is present, wet methods should be used to suppress dust, and appropriate PPE should be worn.

### 10.4 Underestimating the Timeline

**What it is:** Assuming demolition will take a day or two when it actually takes a week or more, particularly for larger scopes involving asbestos removal, multiple rooms, or structural elements.

**Why it is costly:** Trades booked to start immediately after demolition (e.g., electricians, plumbers, plasterers) arrive to find the site not ready. They either leave (and need to be rebooked, often weeks later) or stand around on the clock waiting. This cascading delay can add weeks to the overall renovation timeline.

**What should be done instead:** Build a realistic demolition timeline with your contractor. Add buffer days between demolition completion and the start of follow-on trades. For scopes involving asbestos removal, allow at least 1-2 additional weeks for the asbestos process (testing, removal, clearance, disposal) before general demolition can proceed.

### 10.5 Not Securing the Site

**What it is:** Leaving the demolition site unsecured after hours, creating risks for children, trespassers, and theft.

**Why it is dangerous:** Partially demolished structures are unstable. Exposed nails, broken glass, open floor voids, and dangling wiring create serious injury risks. Unsecured sites also invite theft of tools, materials, and fixtures.

**What should be done instead:** Secure the site at the end of each work day. Lock entry points, fence off open areas, and ensure no open voids or fall hazards are accessible. If the site is a full house demolition, temporary fencing should be installed before work begins.

### 10.6 Forgetting to Arrange Temporary Facilities

**What it is:** Demolishing the only bathroom or kitchen without arranging temporary alternatives.

**Why it is costly:** If you are living in the home during renovation and demolish the only bathroom, you will need a temporary portable toilet and potentially a temporary shower. If you demolish the kitchen, you need a temporary cooking and dishwashing setup. Failing to plan this creates significant livability issues.

**What should be done instead:** If living in the home during renovation, set up a temporary kitchen (microwave, electric cooktop, bar fridge) in another room before demolishing the main kitchen. Arrange a portable toilet or confirm that a second bathroom will remain operational throughout demolition.
