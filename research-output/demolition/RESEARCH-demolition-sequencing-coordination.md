## 1. Pre-Demolition Requirements

Everything in this section **must be completed before any demolition work commences**. Failure to complete these steps can result in safety incidents, regulatory fines, project delays, or damage to the property and neighbouring properties.

### 1.1 Asbestos Inspection and Clearance

**Mandatory for any property built before 1990 (and strongly recommended for pre-2003 properties).**

- **Legal requirement:** Sections 452 and 453 of the WHS Regulation require asbestos to be identified and removed before demolition commences, so far as is reasonably practicable. If a duty holder does not remove asbestos prior to demolition, they must provide evidence as to why it was not reasonably practicable.
- **Type of inspection required:** A **Type 3 Demolition Asbestos Inspection** is needed before demolition. This is more invasive than a standard management survey -- it includes inspection of wall cavities and areas not accessible when the building is occupied. It partially complies with AS 2601 (Demolition of Structures).
- **Who performs it:** A licensed asbestos assessor (hygienist) must conduct the inspection and provide a report identifying the location, type, and condition of all asbestos-containing materials (ACMs).
- **Removal licensing:**
  - **Non-friable asbestos (bonded):** A non-friable asbestos removal licence is required to remove more than 10 sqm of non-friable asbestos.
  - **Friable asbestos (loose/crumbly):** A friable asbestos removal licence is required to remove any amount of friable asbestos.
- **Clearance certificate:** After removal, a clearance inspection must be conducted and a clearance certificate issued before the area can be re-occupied or further work can proceed. The local council will typically require the clearance certificate before issuing further approvals.
- **Notification:** Asbestos removal work must be notified to the relevant state/territory WHS regulator (e.g., SafeWork NSW, WorkSafe Victoria) at least 5 days before removal commences.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Every demolition scope must include an asbestos inspection as a prerequisite line item. If ACMs are found, add asbestos removal as a separate line item with its own timeline and cost.

### 1.2 Service Disconnection Scheduling

All active utility services must be disconnected or isolated before demolition begins. This is both a legal requirement and a critical safety step.

| Service | Who Disconnects | Lead Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Electricity** | Level 2 ASP (Accredited Service Provider) for permanent disconnection/abolishment; licensed electrician for internal isolation | Up to 28 days | Disconnection only switches off supply -- live cables remain between meter and street. Abolishment permanently removes the meter and supply cable. For internal renovation (not full demolition), an electrician isolates relevant circuits at the switchboard. |
| **Water** | Licensed plumber (internal); water authority (mains) | 5-14 days | Plumber caps internal water supply lines. For full demolition, the water authority disconnects at the mains. |
| **Sewer/Drainage** | Licensed plumber | 5-14 days | Sewer connections are capped and sealed to prevent contamination. |
| **Gas** | Licensed gas fitter | 7-28 days | Gas disconnection requires a written request to the gas network provider (e.g., Jemena, Multinet, Australian Gas Networks). A licensed gas fitter disconnects internal appliances. The network provider disconnects at the meter/main. |
| **Telecommunications** | Telco provider (NBN, Telstra, etc.) | 7-14 days | If demolition affects the connection point, notify the provider. |
| **Solar/Battery** | Licensed electrician (CEC-accredited for solar) | Varies | Solar systems must be fully isolated before roof or electrical demolition. |

**Key rule:** Requests must be made in writing using the correct forms, typically a couple of weeks before demolition is due to take place. Because disconnections can take up to 28 days, this must be organised well in advance.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Include specific line items for each service disconnection. The scope should state which services are present and need disconnection, and flag the required lead times.

### 1.3 Council Approvals (If Required)

Demolition is classified as "development" in Australia and requires approval from local authorities.

- **Exempt development:** Minor internal demolition (e.g., removing non-structural internal walls, removing a kitchen or bathroom fitout) may be classified as exempt development in some jurisdictions and may not require formal approval. Check the relevant State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP) or local council guidelines.
- **Complying Development Certificate (CDC):** Most residential demolition projects can be approved via a CDC issued by a Registered Certifier (private certifier). This is faster than a DA -- approvals are possible in as little as 10 days. The project must strictly meet all criteria in the relevant planning codes.
- **Development Application (DA):** Required for demolition in heritage areas, near heritage items, on flood-prone land, bushfire-prone land, or where the project does not meet CDC criteria. DAs are lodged with the local council and can take several weeks to months.
- **Notification to council/regulator:** In general, notification of demolition work must be submitted to the relevant state/territory authority at least 5 days before work commences.

**State-specific legislation:**
- **NSW:** Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979
- **VIC:** Planning and Environment Act 1987 (building permit via VBA)
- **QLD:** Planning Act 2016
- **WA:** Planning and Development Act 2005
- **SA:** Planning, Development and Infrastructure Act 2016

**Scope-of-works implication:** The scope should identify whether a CDC, DA, or no approval is needed. Include the approval pathway as a prerequisite milestone.

### 1.4 Structural Engineer Sign-Off (If Structural Work is Involved)

**Required whenever demolition involves load-bearing walls, roof structures, floor structures, or any element that contributes to the structural integrity of the building.**

- **When it is needed:**
  - Removal of any load-bearing wall (internal or external)
  - Removal of a section of roof structure
  - Opening up floor areas or modifying floor joists
  - Any work that changes load paths in the building
- **What the engineer provides:**
  - Load analysis of the wall/element to be removed
  - Design of the replacement support system (typically steel beams, LVL beams, posts, or columns)
  - Structural calculations and engineering drawings
  - Specification of temporary propping requirements during demolition
  - Certification documentation for council/certifier
- **Cost:** Typically $500-$800 for a standard residential wall removal assessment and beam design. Complex projects cost more.
- **Requirement for approval:** Local councils will not approve a load-bearing wall removal without structural engineering sign-off. The engineering documentation forms part of the CDC or DA submission.

**Scope-of-works implication:** If any structural demolition is in scope, include a line item for structural engineering assessment and design. The structural engineer's drawings must be available on-site before demolition of structural elements commences.

### 1.5 Skip Bin Delivery

- **Sizing guide for residential renovation demolition:**

| Project Type | Recommended Bin Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bathroom renovation | 2-4 m3 | Tiles, plasterboard, fixtures |
| Kitchen renovation | 4-5 m3 | Cabinetry, benchtops, tiles, plasterboard |
| Single room strip-out | 4-6 m3 | Depends on materials |
| Multi-room / whole-floor demolition | 8-12 m3 | May need multiple bins |
| Full house demolition | 20-30 m3 | Specialist demolition bins |

- **Timing:** The bin should be delivered and placed on-site **before demolition starts** -- ideally the day before or morning of. Planning delivery to coincide with the demolition phase prevents waste accumulating on the property.
- **Standard hire period:** Most providers offer 7-10 day hire periods.
- **Permits:** Placing a bin on private property (e.g., driveway) typically does not require a permit. Placing a bin on public property (e.g., road, footpath, nature strip) usually requires a council permit with specific placement and duration rules.
- **Prohibited materials:** Asbestos, chemicals, paint, batteries, gas bottles, liquids, food waste, and medical waste cannot go in standard skip bins. Asbestos requires a separate licensed removal and disposal process.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Include skip bin hire as a line item. Specify size, number of bins, placement location, and whether a council permit is needed.

### 1.6 Site Protection Setup

Site protection must be installed **before demolition begins** to protect surfaces, finishes, and areas that are not being demolished. This is covered in detail in [Section 4](#4-site-protection-requirements) below.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Include site protection setup as a prerequisite task with specific materials and locations listed.

### 1.7 Neighbour Notification

- **NSW requirements (Complying Development):**
  - Neighbours within 20 metres of the boundary of the development lot must be notified in writing before work commences.
  - In metropolitan areas: at least **7 days' notice** before work begins.
  - In rural/regional areas: at least **2 days' notice**.
  - The certifier or council must also inform neighbours within a 20-metre radius that a CDC application has been lodged, at least **14 days** before it can be approved.
  - Notification can be given in person, through a letter box, or via post.
- **Strata/apartment buildings:** Check the strata by-laws. Most require formal written notice to the owners corporation/body corporate and the strata manager. Some by-laws require committee approval of a renovation work schedule.
- **General best practice (all states):** Even where not legally required, notifying immediate neighbours in writing is strongly recommended. Include expected start/end dates, working hours, the nature of the work, and a contact person for complaints.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Include neighbour notification as a checklist item with a template letter. For strata, include strata approval and notification as a prerequisite.

### 1.8 Temporary Facilities (If Needed)

When demolition affects essential facilities (e.g., the only bathroom is being demolished, or power is being disconnected), temporary alternatives must be arranged.

- **Temporary toilet (portable toilet):**
  - Required by WHS regulations if the existing toilet is being demolished and workers are on site.
  - Queensland law requires at least one toilet for every 15 workers on an active construction site.
  - Must provide toilet paper, hand-washing facilities, and rubbish bins.
  - Hire cost: typically $150-$300 per week depending on location and service frequency.
- **Temporary power (temporary power pole or builder's supply):**
  - If the main power supply is being disconnected or the switchboard is being modified, a temporary power pole provides electricity to the site.
  - Connects to the mains supply via overhead or underground connection and provides multiple general-purpose outlets (GPOs) for tools, lights, and equipment.
  - Must be installed by a licensed electrician and inspected by the electricity distributor.
  - Lead time: typically 1-2 weeks for connection.
- **Temporary water supply:** If water is being disconnected, a temporary water connection or water tank may be needed for dust suppression, cleaning, and worker amenities.
- **Temporary fencing/hoarding:** Required if the demolition zone is accessible from a public area or if the site presents a fall risk.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Assess whether temporary facilities are needed based on the scope of demolition. Include as line items where applicable.

## 2. Trades Required During Demolition

The following trades are typically required during the demolition phase. Their work must be sequenced correctly to ensure safety and compliance.

### 2.1 Electrician -- Disconnect and Isolate Circuits

- **When:** Before any physical demolition begins in the affected area.
- **What they do:**
  - Identify all circuits serving the demolition zone at the switchboard.
  - Isolate and lock out relevant circuits (tag-out/lock-out procedure).
  - Disconnect and remove wiring, power points, light fittings, and switches in the demolition area.
  - Ensure no live wiring remains in walls, ceilings, or floors that are to be demolished.
  - If solar panels are present, isolate the solar system before roof demolition.
- **Licensing:** Must be a licensed electrician. All work must comply with AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules).
- **Certificate:** The electrician should issue a Certificate of Compliance for Electrical Work (CCEW) for the disconnection.
- **Typical duration:** 2-4 hours for a standard residential renovation; longer for complex or multi-zone work.

### 2.2 Plumber -- Disconnect and Cap Water/Sewer

- **When:** Before demolition of any wet areas (bathrooms, kitchens, laundries) or areas with water/sewer lines running through them.
- **What they do:**
  - Turn off water supply at the isolation valve or meter.
  - Cut and cap hot and cold water supply lines in the demolition zone.
  - Cap or seal sewer/drain connections to prevent sewer gas and contamination.
  - Remove fixtures (basins, toilets, baths, sinks) if required.
  - Identify and mark any services running through walls/floors for the demolition crew.
- **Licensing:** Must be a licensed plumber.
- **Typical duration:** 2-4 hours for a standard bathroom or kitchen.

### 2.3 Gas Fitter -- Disconnect Gas

- **When:** Before demolition of any area with gas appliances or gas lines.
- **What they do:**
  - Isolate gas supply at the meter or internal isolation point.
  - Disconnect gas appliances (cooktop, oven, hot water system, heater).
  - Cap gas lines to prevent leaks.
  - Test for leaks after capping.
  - If required, arrange for the gas network provider to disconnect at the main.
- **Licensing:** Must be a licensed gas fitter (in most states, this is a plumber with a gas fitting endorsement). In NSW, a specific licence or certificate is required for any gas fitting work regardless of cost or whether the work is residential, commercial, or industrial.
- **Typical duration:** 1-3 hours depending on the number of appliances and complexity.

### 2.4 Asbestos Removalist (If ACMs Found)

- **When:** After the asbestos inspection report is issued and before general demolition begins. Asbestos removal must be completed and a clearance certificate issued before the demolition crew can start work in the affected area.
- **What they do:**
  - Set up a controlled removal area with containment barriers, negative air pressure units, and decontamination facilities (for friable asbestos).
  - Carefully remove ACMs following Safe Work Australia's Code of Practice for the Safe Removal of Asbestos.
  - Bag, label, and transport asbestos waste to a licensed disposal facility.
  - Conduct air monitoring during and after removal (for friable asbestos).
  - Obtain a clearance certificate from a licensed asbestos assessor.
- **Licensing:**
  - Non-friable (bonded) asbestos (>10 sqm): Non-friable (Class B) removal licence.
  - Friable asbestos (any amount): Friable (Class A) removal licence.
- **Common locations of ACMs in residential buildings:**
  - Eaves and soffit lining
  - Flat and corrugated roofing sheets
  - Internal wall and ceiling linings (fibro)
  - Vinyl floor tiles and backing
  - Wet area wall linings (behind tiles in bathrooms)
  - Electrical switchboard backing
  - Pipe lagging and insulation
  - Fencing (fibro fence sheets)

### 2.5 Demolition Crew

- **When:** After all service disconnections are confirmed, asbestos has been removed (if applicable), site protection is installed, and the area is safe to work in.
- **What they do:**
  - Strip out fixtures and fittings (cabinets, benchtops, vanities, built-in wardrobes, shelving).
  - Remove floor coverings (carpet, vinyl, tiles).
  - Remove wall linings (plasterboard/gyprock, tiles).
  - Remove ceiling linings.
  - Demolish non-structural walls (timber framing, steel stud framing, brick).
  - Demolish structural elements **only with structural engineer's design, temporary propping in place, and in the correct sequence as specified by the engineer**.
  - Load debris into skip bins, separating waste streams where possible (timber, metal, plasterboard, general waste).
- **Demolition sequence (general rule):** Work from the top down -- ceilings first, then walls, then floors. Strip finishes before demolishing structure.
- **Licensing/insurance:** Demolition contractors should hold appropriate licences (requirements vary by state), public liability insurance, and workers compensation insurance.
- **Typical duration:**
  - Bathroom strip-out: 1-2 days
  - Kitchen strip-out: 1-2 days
  - Single room strip-out: 1 day
  - Whole house internal strip-out: 3-7 days

### 2.6 Typical Demolition Day Sequence

For a standard residential renovation (e.g., kitchen and bathroom renovation), the typical day-of-demolition sequence is:

1. **Morning -- Electrician arrives** (isolates circuits, removes wiring/fittings in demo zone)
2. **Morning -- Plumber arrives** (caps water, seals drains, removes fixtures)
3. **Morning -- Gas fitter arrives** (disconnects gas appliances, caps gas lines) -- if applicable
4. **Mid-morning onwards -- Demolition crew commences** (strip-out and demolition)
5. **End of day -- Site cleanup** (debris loaded into skip bin, site swept, dust barriers checked)

In practice, the electrician, plumber, and gas fitter may work simultaneously in different areas if the site allows, but the demolition crew cannot start until all services are confirmed isolated.

---

## 3. Post-Demolition Activities

### 3.1 Site Cleanup and Inspection

- **Immediate cleanup:** All debris removed from the work area and loaded into skip bins. The site is swept and vacuumed (using a HEPA-filtered vacuum for dust containing potential contaminants).
- **Structural inspection:** If structural elements were removed, the structural engineer (or a building surveyor) inspects the temporary propping and confirms the structure is stable before further work proceeds.
- **Demolition completion inspection:** In Victoria, a mandatory final inspection is required at the completion of all demolition or removal work. Other states have similar requirements. The registered building surveyor (RBS) must conduct this inspection in person.
- **Services check:** Confirm that all capped services (water, sewer, gas) are holding and not leaking. Confirm that isolated electrical circuits remain locked out.
- **Asbestos clearance:** If asbestos was removed, confirm the clearance certificate has been issued for the relevant areas.
- **Photographic record:** Document the post-demolition state of the site with photos. This provides a record for the builder, engineer, and certifier.

### 3.2 Structural Work Can Begin

Once demolition is complete and the site is cleared:

- **Beam and post installation:** Steel beams (UBs, PFCs), LVL beams, or timber beams are installed per the structural engineer's design to replace removed load-bearing walls.
- **Propping removal:** Temporary propping is removed only after permanent structural supports are in place and the engineer has confirmed the installation is correct.
- **Footing modifications:** If new posts or columns require new footings, this work is done immediately after demolition.
- **Floor levelling/repair:** Damaged or uneven floor framing or slabs are repaired or levelled.
- **Timeline:** Structural work typically takes 1-5 days depending on complexity.

### 3.3 Rough-In Trades Can Begin

After structural work is complete (or concurrently if no structural work is needed):

- **Plumbing rough-in comes FIRST:**
  - New drainage lines, waste pipes, and water supply lines are installed.
  - Plumbing rough-in takes priority because pipes are larger, harder to relocate, and require precise placement (especially drainage which relies on gravity fall).
  - The plumber installs pipework inside walls, floors, and ceilings before they are closed up.
  - Typical duration: 2-5 days.

- **Electrical rough-in comes SECOND:**
  - New wiring, cable runs, power point locations, light switch locations, and data/comms cabling are installed.
  - Electrical wiring is more flexible in routing and can work around existing plumbing.
  - The electrician installs wiring inside walls, ceilings, and floors before they are closed up.
  - Typical duration: 1-3 days.

- **HVAC rough-in (if applicable):**
  - Ductwork, refrigerant lines, and drain lines for air conditioning are installed.
  - Typically coordinated with electrical (for power supply to units) and plumbing (for condensate drainage).
  - Typical duration: 1-3 days.

- **Key rule:** All rough-in work must be completed and inspected before wall linings (plasterboard) are installed, as the services will be concealed behind walls and ceilings.

### 3.4 Building Inspections (If Structural Work Was Done)

Mandatory inspection stages vary by state but generally include:

- **Pre-demolition precautions inspection:** Must be conducted before demolition starts (confirms safety measures are in place).
- **Post-demolition / pre-construction inspection:** Confirms demolition is complete, the site is safe, and structural elements are correctly supported.
- **Frame inspection:** After structural steel/timber is installed, the building surveyor inspects to confirm compliance with the structural engineer's design and the Building Code of Australia (BCA/NCC).
- **Pre-lining inspection:** Before plasterboard goes up, the surveyor inspects the framing, services rough-in, insulation, and fire/acoustic separation to confirm compliance.

**Important:** The RBS (Registered Building Surveyor) must conduct mandatory inspections in person. Photographs, drone footage, or third-party reports alone are not sufficient.

**Scope-of-works implication:** Include inspection hold points in the project schedule. Work cannot proceed past these points until the inspection is passed.

## 4. Site Protection Requirements

### 4.1 Floor Protection

**What needs protecting:** Any existing flooring that is being retained -- hardwood, tiles, polished concrete, engineered timber, carpet, vinyl.

| Material | Best For | Thickness/Weight | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ram Board** (heavy-duty fibre board) | High-traffic demolition zones, timber/tile floors | 1.5mm thick, rolls of 0.94m x 30m | 5x thicker than builder's paper; spill-proof; vapour-permeable (allows curing floors to breathe); reusable | Higher cost (~$120-$180 per roll) |
| **Corrugated cardboard sheets** (4x8 or custom) | Light to medium protection, low-traffic areas | 3-5mm | Cheap; easy to cut and lay; recyclable | Not waterproof; can shift; staples in cardboard can scratch timber floors if not checked |
| **Plywood sheets** (3mm-6mm) | Heavy-duty protection for high-impact zones | 3-6mm | Very strong; protects against drops and heavy loads | Heavy; can be slippery; more expensive; harder to cut on-site |
| **Builder's paper / kraft paper** | Light protection, paint overspray | 0.3mm | Very cheap; disposable | Tears easily; no impact protection; not waterproof |
| **Self-adhesive floor film** | Short-term protection for hard floors and carpet | 0.05-0.1mm | Easy to apply and remove; no residue (if removed within specified timeframe) | No impact protection; carpet film max 30 days, hard surface film max 60 days |
| **Masonite (hardboard)** | Premium flooring protection | 3.2mm-6mm | Dense; durable; smooth surface | Heavier; more expensive than cardboard |

**Installation best practice:**
- Clean the floor thoroughly before laying protection (trapped grit causes scratches).
- Tape seams with a quality seam tape (e.g., Ram Board Seam Tape) to prevent debris getting underneath.
- Extend protection at least 1 metre beyond the demolition zone into adjacent rooms/corridors.
- For timber floors, avoid using duct tape directly on the floor surface (adhesive residue can damage finish).

**Who is responsible:** The head contractor or demolition contractor is responsible for installing floor protection before demolition begins. The scope of works should clearly assign this responsibility.

### 4.2 Door Protection

- **Doors remaining in place:** Cover with builder's paper, cardboard, or purpose-made door protection sleeves. Use painter's tape (low-tack) to secure -- never use duct tape on painted or finished surfaces.
- **Doors that can be removed:** Remove from hinges, wrap in protective material (plastic sheeting or moving blankets), and store safely away from the work zone. Label each door with its location for reinstallation.
- **Door frames:** Protect with cardboard corner guards or foam edge protectors taped in place. Door frames are highly susceptible to damage from materials being carried through.
- **Thresholds:** Cover with blue painter's tape or UV-resistant tape, or use fitted plastic threshold covers.

### 4.3 Stair Protection

Stairs are high-traffic areas during demolition and extremely susceptible to damage.

- **Timber/carpet stairs:** Apply self-adhesive stair protection film (carpet film for carpeted stairs, hard surface film for timber). Add Ram Board or corrugated cardboard over the top for impact protection. Secure with tape on risers (not on treads, to avoid slipping).
- **Tread and nosing protection:** Use fire-rated stair guards or foam edge protectors on stair nosings (the front edge of each tread). These are impact-resistant and protect against tool drops and material transport.
- **Handrail protection:** Wrap handrails with foam pipe insulation or corrugated cardboard, secured with painter's tape.
- **Key rule:** Clean stairs thoroughly before installing protection. Grit trapped under protection will scratch and damage finishes.
- **Sticky tack mats:** Can be placed on stair landings to capture dust and debris from foot traffic.

### 4.4 Dust Barriers (Plastic Sheeting, Zip Walls)

Dust barriers are critical to contain demolition dust within the work zone and prevent it from spreading to occupied or finished areas.

- **ZipWall system:** Adjustable spring-loaded poles that hold plastic sheeting from floor to ceiling, creating a sealed barrier. Ideal for creating a temporary wall between the demolition zone and the rest of the house. Poles are reusable; sheeting is disposable.
- **Plastic sheeting (poly sheeting):** 200 micron (0.2mm) thick polyethylene sheeting is the standard for dust barriers. Secured with tape, ZipWall poles, or timber battens. Use 2 layers for heavy demolition.
- **Self-closing zippered doorways:** A slit cut in the plastic sheeting with an adhesive zipper allows passage through the dust barrier while maintaining the seal. Essential for any barrier that workers need to pass through regularly.
- **Negative air pressure:** For heavy demolition or where dust containment is critical (e.g., occupied homes, medical/sensitive environments), set up a HEPA-filtered air scrubber inside the demolition zone. This creates negative air pressure, drawing air into the zone and filtering it, preventing dust from escaping.
- **Sealing gaps:** Use painter's tape and plastic sheeting to seal around the edges of the dust barrier, including at the floor, ceiling, and wall junctions. Seal air vents, return air grilles, and any other openings that connect the demolition zone to the rest of the building.

**Where to install dust barriers:**
- At every doorway/opening between the demolition zone and occupied/finished areas.
- Over any open passageways, hallways, or stairwells adjacent to the demolition zone.
- Over air conditioning vents and return air grilles in the demolition zone (to prevent dust circulating through the HVAC system).

### 4.5 Common Areas Protection (Apartments/Units/Strata)

Renovating within a strata building adds significant protection requirements for common property areas.

- **Strata by-law requirements:**
  - Most strata schemes require formal written notice and approval from the owners corporation before renovation work begins.
  - By-laws typically specify working hours, insurance requirements for tradespeople, and protection of common property.
  - A bond/deposit may be required (held by the strata manager) to cover any damage to common areas.
  - Only licensed professionals may perform electrical, plumbing, or waterproofing work.

- **What must be protected:**
  - **Lift interiors:** Line the interior of lifts used for material transport with plywood or heavy cardboard. Protect lift doors with cardboard and tape.
  - **Corridors and hallways:** Lay Ram Board or heavy-duty corrugated cardboard from the unit entrance to the lift/stairwell. Tape all seams.
  - **Lobby and foyer areas:** Protect flooring along the material transport route.
  - **Stairwells:** Full stair protection (treads, nosings, handrails) if stairs are used to transport demolition waste or materials.
  - **Fire doors and common doors:** Protect with cardboard and foam edge protectors.
  - **Walls along transport routes:** Protect with corrugated cardboard or foam panels, especially at corners.

- **Who is responsible:** The lot owner (client) and their contractor are typically responsible for protecting common areas. Damage to common property is the lot owner's liability.

## 5. Dust and Noise Management

### 5.1 Dust Containment Methods

Demolition activities generate significant dust from plasterboard, tiles, timber, adhesives, grout, ceramics, MDF, painted surfaces, carpet underlay, and accumulated debris. Effective dust management protects worker health, prevents damage to retained finishes, and maintains livability for occupants (if the home is occupied during renovation).

**Methods (in order of priority):**

1. **Source containment (dust barriers):** Install ZipWall or plastic sheeting barriers to physically contain dust within the demolition zone. See Section 4.4 above.

2. **Wet dust suppression:** Dampen surfaces before and during demolition to prevent dust becoming airborne. Use a pump spray bottle or garden sprayer. Wet cutting (using water when cutting concrete, tiles, or masite) significantly reduces airborne dust. Do not over-wet -- excessive water can damage timber framing and subfloors.

3. **Dust extraction at source:** Use power tools with integrated dust extraction (e.g., Hilti dust removal systems, Makita dust extractors). Connect angle grinders, circular saws, and demolition tools to a vacuum/extractor. This captures dust at the point of generation.

4. **HEPA air scrubbers/filtration:** Place HEPA-filtered air scrubbers inside the demolition zone to capture fine particles. These units filter the air and can create negative pressure to prevent dust escaping the zone. Recommended for any demolition in an occupied home.

5. **Personal protective equipment (PPE):** All workers in the demolition zone must wear P2 (N95 equivalent) dust masks at minimum. For silica dust (from cutting tiles, concrete, or engineered stone), RPE (respiratory protective equipment) with a higher protection factor is required per Safe Work Australia guidelines.

6. **Cleanup protocols:** Vacuum with a HEPA-filtered vacuum (not a standard domestic vacuum) at the end of each work day. Do not dry sweep -- this re-aerosolises dust. Damp wipe surfaces as needed.

**Health risks from dust exposure:**
- Silicosis (from silica dust -- tiles, concrete, engineered stone)
- Lung cancer (prolonged exposure to airborne contaminants)
- Asthma and COPD (from inhaling fine particles)
- Eye and skin irritation

### 5.2 Noise Reduction Measures

Demolition is inherently noisy. While noise cannot be eliminated, it can be managed.

- **Use of appropriate tools:** Where possible, use cutting tools rather than impact tools (e.g., a reciprocating saw to cut through framing rather than a sledgehammer). Use electric tools over pneumatic tools where feasible (lower noise output).
- **Scheduling noisy work:** Concentrate the loudest work (jackhammering, concrete cutting, wall demolition) in the middle of the day rather than first thing in the morning.
- **Acoustic barriers:** Temporary acoustic blankets or panels can be hung around the work zone to absorb sound. These are particularly useful in strata buildings where noise transmission to neighbouring units is a concern.
- **Communication:** Inform neighbours of the schedule for particularly noisy work so they can plan accordingly.

### 5.3 Council Noise Regulations Compliance

Construction and demolition noise is regulated at the state and local council level. The following are general guidelines -- always check with the specific local council, as they may have stricter rules.

| State | Permitted Hours (Weekdays) | Permitted Hours (Saturday) | Sunday/Public Holidays |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM | 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM (8:00 AM in some councils) | Generally not permitted (8:00 AM - 8:00 PM for some light work in some areas) |
| **VIC** | 7:00 AM - 6:00 PM | 7:00 AM - 6:00 PM (some councils allow 9:00 AM start on Saturdays) | Not permitted (some councils allow 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM with restrictions) |
| **QLD** | 6:30 AM - 6:30 PM | 6:30 AM - 6:30 PM | Not permitted |
| **SA** | 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM | 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM | Not permitted |
| **WA** | 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM | 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM (some councils restrict to 8:00 AM start) | Not permitted |

**Key points:**
- These are general state guidelines. Individual councils may impose stricter hours.
- Strata buildings often have additional restrictions in their by-laws (e.g., no work before 8:00 AM, no work on weekends at all).
- Penalties can apply for breaching noise regulations.
- Some councils require a noise management plan for demolition work.

### 5.4 Neighbour Relations Management

Good neighbour relations prevent complaints, council involvement, and project delays.

**Best practices:**
- **Written notification before work starts:** Provide a letter with the expected start/end dates, working hours, the nature of the work (e.g., "We will be demolishing the kitchen and bathroom"), and a contact name and phone number for complaints or questions.
- **Face-to-face introduction:** Where possible, the homeowner or site manager should introduce themselves to immediate neighbours before work begins.
- **Progress updates:** For longer projects, a brief weekly update or notice can maintain goodwill.
- **Respond to complaints promptly:** Have a process for receiving and addressing complaints. Acknowledge the concern, explain the situation, and offer a specific resolution or timeline.
- **Minimise impact:**
  - Keep the street and footpath clean of debris.
  - Do not block driveways or parking spaces without notice.
  - Keep noise strictly within permitted hours.
  - Do not start generators or compressors early in the morning.
- **Shared walls/boundaries:** For terraces, semi-detached houses, and apartments, extra care is needed. Vibration from demolition can be felt through shared walls. Inform neighbours of when the heaviest work will occur.
