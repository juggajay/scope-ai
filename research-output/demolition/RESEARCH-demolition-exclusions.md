# SECTION 6: Common Exclusions from Residential Demolition Scopes

**Context:** Australian residential renovations (partial and full demolition)
**Purpose:** Reference material for an AI scope-of-works generator
**Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## Overview

A demolition quote for a residential renovation in Australia typically covers the physical act of demolition (stripping out, pulling down, loading, and disposing of materials) and, in some cases, basic site clean-up. However, there are numerous cost items that fall outside a standard demolition scope. These exclusions represent separate trades, specialist licences, regulatory fees, or contingency items that cannot be priced accurately until site conditions are fully understood.

Homeowners who fail to account for these exclusions regularly blow their renovation budgets by $10,000 to $50,000+. An AI scope-of-works generator must flag every one of these items clearly so the homeowner can budget and plan accordingly.

## 6.1 Asbestos Testing and Removal

### What It Is

Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) are common in Australian homes built before 1990. They can be found in eaves, wall cladding (fibro), bathroom and laundry linings, vinyl floor tiles, roof sheeting, fencing, pipe lagging, and insulation. Before any demolition work begins, suspected materials must be tested by a NATA-accredited laboratory and, if confirmed positive, removed by a licensed asbestos removalist.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- **Licensing:** Australian state and territory WHS legislation requires asbestos removal to be carried out by a **Class A** licensed removalist (for friable/loose asbestos) or a **Class B** licensed removalist (for non-friable/bonded asbestos such as fibro sheeting). Most general demolition contractors do not hold these licences.
- **Insurance and Liability:** Asbestos removal carries specific insurance requirements. Contamination liability, workers' compensation, and public liability premiums are separate from general demolition cover.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Removal requires a site-specific asbestos removal control plan (ARCP), air monitoring by an independent licensed assessor, and correct disposal at an EPA-licensed facility. These are specialist obligations.
- **Variable Scope:** The quantity and condition of ACMs is often unknown until intrusive investigation occurs. A demolition contractor cannot price what they cannot see.

### Who Handles It

- **Testing:** An occupational hygienist, licensed asbestos assessor, or the homeowner (via a DIY sample kit sent to a NATA-accredited lab).
- **Removal:** A Class A or Class B licensed asbestos removalist.
- **Air Monitoring:** An independent licensed assessor (required for friable removal and recommended for non-friable).

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Laboratory testing per sample (NATA-accredited) | $40 - $140 per sample |
| Professional asbestos inspection (residential) | $300 - $800 |
| Small removal job (single room, small area) | $1,000 - $4,000 |
| Medium removal job (full roof or multiple rooms) | $4,000 - $8,000 |
| Large removal job (whole house, extensive ACMs) | $10,000 - $20,000+ |
| Asbestos fencing removal | $90 - $160 per linear metre |
| Asbestos roof removal | $80 - $110 per m2 (small jobs) |
| Disposal fees at licensed facility | $300 - $500+ |
| Indoor air quality monitoring | $300 - $1,500 |

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Asbestos removal is **legally mandatory** before demolition if ACMs are present. Work cannot proceed without it.
- Failing to test and remove asbestos before demolition is a criminal offence under WHS legislation and can result in fines exceeding $50,000 for individuals.
- If asbestos is discovered mid-demolition, all work must stop immediately, adding significant delays and cost.
- This is often the single largest "hidden" cost in a renovation budget.

## 6.2 Structural Engineering Fees

### What It Is

Any demolition work that involves removing or modifying load-bearing walls, roof structures, floor structures, or any element that contributes to the structural integrity of a building requires the involvement of a qualified structural engineer. Their scope typically includes:

- **Pre-demolition assessment:** Inspecting the existing structure to determine what is load-bearing, what can be removed, and what needs support.
- **Beam and post design:** Designing replacement structural members (steel beams, LVL beams, timber lintels, steel posts, concrete footings) to carry loads after walls are removed.
- **Propping plan:** Specifying how the structure must be temporarily supported during demolition and until permanent structural members are installed.
- **Connection details:** Specifying how new beams connect to existing structure (brackets, welds, bolts, bearer connections).
- **Certification and sign-off:** Inspecting the completed structural work and issuing a compliance certificate (Form 15 in QLD, equivalent in other states).

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- Structural engineering is a professional service regulated under state engineering registration acts (e.g., RPEQ in Queensland, BPEQ).
- A demolition contractor is not qualified or insured to provide engineering advice.
- The engineering scope is determined by the renovation design, not by the demolition scope alone.
- Structural design must be completed **before** demolition begins so the propping plan is in place.

### Who Handles It

A registered structural engineer (chartered engineer, CPEng, RPEQ, or equivalent state registration).

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Service | Cost Range (AUD) |
|---------|-----------------|
| Simple structural drawings for home renovation (e.g., single wall removal, beam design) | $500 - $2,000 (excl. GST) |
| Structural inspection / site visit (hourly rate) | $100 - $300 per hour |
| Engineering report (insurance, council, or renovation purposes) | $500 - $3,000 |
| Full structural engineering for larger renovation (multi-wall removal, new openings, floor modifications) | $3,000 - $5,000 |
| Detailed structural plans for complex projects | $5,000 - $15,000+ |
| As a percentage of total construction cost (smaller residential) | 1% - 3% of construction cost |
| As a percentage of total construction cost (complex residential) | 0.5% - 5% of construction cost |

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Structural engineering must be completed and approved **before** demolition starts. It is on the critical path.
- Without engineering sign-off, a private certifier or council will not issue a Construction Certificate (CC).
- Under-estimating engineering fees can delay a project by weeks if designs need revision.
- A good structural engineer can also save money by right-sizing beams rather than over-engineering.

---

## 6.3 Council and Certification Fees

### What It Is

Most residential demolition and renovation work in Australia requires some form of regulatory approval. The two main pathways are:

1. **Development Application (DA):** Lodged with the local council. Required for work that does not qualify as exempt or complying development. Assessed by council planners.
2. **Complying Development Certificate (CDC):** Issued by council or an accredited private certifier. A faster alternative to a DA for work that meets specific standards (typically governed by the State Environmental Planning Policy -- Exempt and Complying Development Codes).
3. **Construction Certificate (CC) / Complying Development Certificate:** Required before construction begins, separate from the DA.
4. **Occupation Certificate (OC):** Required before occupation of the completed work.
5. **Inspection Fees:** Critical-stage inspections throughout the build by council or private certifier.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- Council and certification fees are regulatory charges payable to government or accredited certifiers, not to the demolition contractor.
- The fee amounts depend on the estimated development cost, which is determined by the full renovation scope (not just demolition).
- The approval pathway (DA vs. CDC) is a planning and design decision, not a demolition decision.

### Who Handles It

- **DA lodgement:** The homeowner, their architect, or a town planner.
- **CDC:** An accredited private certifier or council.
- **CC/OC:** An accredited private certifier or council.
- **Inspections:** The appointed Principal Certifier (council or private).

### Approximate Cost Ranges

#### Development Application (DA) Fees -- NSW Example

DA fees in NSW are calculated on a sliding scale based on the Estimated Development Cost (EDC). The fee unit for 2025/26 is $113.90.

| Estimated Development Cost | Approximate DA Fee (NSW) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Up to $5,000 | $170 - $250 |
| $5,001 - $50,000 | $300 - $700 |
| $50,001 - $250,000 | $700 - $2,500 |
| $250,001 - $500,000 | $2,500 - $5,000 |
| $500,001 - $1,000,000 | $5,000 - $8,500 |

*Note: Fees vary by council. Many NSW councils publish DA fee calculators on their websites (e.g., City of Newcastle, Northern Beaches Council, Clarence Valley Council).*

#### CDC Fees

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| CDC approval (private certifier, residential) | $1,000 - $6,500 |
| CDC + all mandatory inspections (packaged) | $1,500 - $5,000 |

#### Private Certifier Fees

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Construction Certificate + inspections (NSW, residential extension) | $900 - $3,000+ |
| Individual additional inspection (per visit) | $150 - $250 per hour |
| NSW Planning Portal fee per certificate | ~$45 - $46 |
| NSW Long Service Levy (projects over $250,000) | 0.25% of construction value |
| QLD council lodgement fee for certification documents | $75 - $300 |

#### Victoria Building Control Fees (2025/26)

| Item | Cost (AUD) |
|------|-----------|
| Statutory inspection | $249 |
| Compliance inspection | $243 |
| Additional inspection | $267 |

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Approval fees are often $2,000 - $8,000+ for a typical residential renovation. This must be budgeted separately.
- The approval pathway (DA vs. CDC) affects both cost and timeline. A CDC is typically faster (10-20 business days) but has more restrictive criteria. A DA can take 40-90+ days.
- Work cannot legally commence without the appropriate approval in place.
- Inspection fees accumulate throughout the project, not just at demolition stage.

---

## 6.4 Service Disconnection by Licensed Trades

### What It Is

Before demolition begins, all active utility services passing through or connected to the demolition zone must be disconnected, capped, or relocated. This includes:

- **Electricity:** Disconnection from mains (power pole to house connection), isolation of circuits serving the demolition area.
- **Gas:** Capping or abolishment of gas supply at the meter or street main.
- **Water:** Capping at the meter (not abolishment -- the builder will need water during construction).
- **Sewer:** Capping outside the building footprint.
- **Telecommunications:** NBN, telephone, Foxtel -- isolation or disconnection.
- **Stormwater:** Temporary management of stormwater flows during demolition.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- **Licensing requirements:** Electrical work must be performed by a licensed electrician. Plumbing and gas work must be performed by a licensed plumber/gasfitter. These are separate trades with their own insurance, licensing, and regulatory obligations.
- **Authority coordination:** Disconnection requires formal applications to utility providers (Ausgrid, Endeavour Energy, Jemena, AGL, Sydney Water, etc.) with lead times of 2-6 weeks.
- **Separate billing:** Utility providers charge their own disconnection and abolishment fees, payable directly by the homeowner, not via the demolition contractor.
- **The demolition contractor cannot legally perform this work** -- it requires licensed tradespeople.

### Who Handles It

| Service | Who Handles It |
|---------|---------------|
| Electricity (mains disconnection) | Electricity distributor (e.g., Ausgrid, Endeavour Energy) + licensed electrician for internal isolation |
| Gas disconnection / abolishment | Gas distributor (e.g., Jemena, Australian Gas Networks) + licensed gasfitter |
| Water capping | Licensed plumber |
| Sewer capping | Licensed plumber/drainer |
| NBN disconnection | Account holder contacts NBN/RSP; NBN removes equipment |
| Telephone/Foxtel | Account holder contacts provider |

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Total service disconnection package (all utilities) | $500 - $2,000+ |
| Gas meter removal (ACT region, residential) | ~$1,000 (incl. GST) |
| Gas disconnection (standard meter) | ~$185 + retailer admin fee |
| Gas supply abolishment (for demolition) | $300+ |
| Licensed electrician (hourly rate) | $70 - $180 per hour |
| Licensed plumber (hourly rate) | $80 - $200 per hour |
| Plumber call-out fee | $50 - $150 |

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Service disconnection has **long lead times** (typically 2-6 weeks). If not arranged early, it will delay the entire project.
- Demolition **cannot legally start** until services are safely disconnected.
- The homeowner (not the demolition contractor) is typically responsible for initiating disconnection requests with each provider.
- Water services should be **capped, not abolished**, because the builder will need water access during construction. Getting water reconnected after an abolishment is significantly more expensive.
- Gas abolishment is irreversible on old infrastructure -- if the homeowner plans to reconnect gas later, they should discuss options with their provider before demolition.
- Some demolition companies offer to coordinate disconnection as part of an "all-inclusive package," but the actual disconnection work is still performed by licensed third parties and billed separately or built into a higher overall price.

## 6.5 Temporary Propping and Structural Steel

### What It Is

When a load-bearing wall, beam, or structural element is being removed as part of a renovation, the remaining structure above (roof, upper floors, ceiling) must be temporarily supported while the old structure is removed and the new permanent structure (typically a steel or LVL beam) is installed. This involves:

- **Temporary propping:** Steel or aluminium adjustable props, frames, or modular propping systems positioned to transfer loads around the demolition zone.
- **Permanent structural steel or LVL supply:** The new beam(s), posts, base plates, brackets, and connections required by the structural engineer's design.
- **Installation of permanent structure:** Lifting and fixing the new beam, welding or bolting connections, pouring footings for new posts.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- Temporary propping must be designed or approved by the structural engineer (it is part of the engineering scope, not the demolition scope).
- Supply of structural steel or LVL beams is a materials procurement item, typically arranged by the builder, not the demolition contractor.
- Installation of permanent structural members requires a steel fabricator/installer or a qualified carpenter (for LVL), not a demolition crew.
- The propping plan is specific to the engineering design and cannot be priced until the engineer has completed their assessment.
- Props may need to remain in place for days or weeks after demolition (until the permanent beam is installed and certified), which is outside the demolition contractor's scope.

### Who Handles It

| Item | Who Handles It |
|------|---------------|
| Propping design | Structural engineer |
| Propping supply (hire) | Propping hire company (e.g., Cassaform, Shore Hire, Coates, Alphasafe) |
| Propping installation/removal | Builder or specialist propping contractor |
| Structural steel fabrication | Steel fabricator |
| Structural steel installation | Builder, steel erector, or licensed rigger |
| LVL beam supply | Timber supplier |
| LVL beam installation | Carpenter or builder |

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Structural steel (supply and install, per tonne) | $3,000 - $4,000 per tonne |
| Steel beam (powder coated, supply only) | ~$45 per linear metre (varies by section size) |
| Light gauge steel framing (supply, fabrication, install) | $1,300 - $2,000 per m2 |
| LVL beam 150x77mm, 6m length (supply only) | $185 - $220 per beam |
| LVL beam 200x45mm, 6m length (supply only) | $160 - $195 per beam |
| Propping hire (per prop per week) | $15 - $50 per prop per week (varies by capacity) |
| Propping design and install (contractor) | Project-specific -- obtain quotes |

*Note: Metropolitan buyers typically pay 10-15% less than regional buyers due to higher supplier density.*

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- This is one of the most commonly misunderstood exclusions. Homeowners assume the demolition contractor will "put the beam in" -- they will not.
- The sequence is critical: **engineer designs > props installed > demolition occurs > permanent beam installed > props removed > engineer certifies**. Any break in this chain causes delays.
- Structural steel or LVL beams often have 1-3 week lead times for fabrication or supply. They must be ordered well before demolition day.
- Propping hire costs accumulate weekly. If the beam installation is delayed, propping costs escalate.
- For a typical single-wall removal with a new steel beam, expect $3,000 - $8,000 for the combined cost of steel supply, fabrication, installation, and propping.

## 6.6 Making Good to Adjacent Areas

### What It Is

When part of a building is demolished (e.g., an internal wall is removed, a room is stripped, a section of roof is taken off), the junction between the demolished area and the retained area is left raw and unfinished. "Making good" refers to all the finishing work required to create a clean, seamless transition, including:

- **Plastering and patching:** Filling holes, patching plasterboard where walls were removed, skim-coating exposed surfaces.
- **Cornices and skirting boards:** Replacing or extending cornices, architraves, and skirting boards where they were cut or removed.
- **Ceiling repair:** Patching ceiling sheeting, replacing damaged battens, re-sheeting where required.
- **Floor patching:** Filling gaps in timber flooring, patching tiles, levelling concrete where a wall once sat.
- **Painting:** Priming and painting patched areas to match existing finishes.
- **Waterproofing:** Re-establishing waterproofing membranes where wet areas are affected.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- Making good is a construction/finishing activity, not a demolition activity.
- It requires different trades: plasterers, painters, tilers, carpenters.
- The scope of making good depends on the renovation design (which may not be finalised at the time of the demolition quote).
- The quality and extent of making good is a design and aesthetic decision, not a demolition decision.

### Who Handles It

| Trade | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Plasterer | Plasterboard patching, skim coating, cornice installation |
| Painter | Priming, painting patched and repaired areas |
| Carpenter | Skirting, architraves, timber floor patching, door adjustments |
| Tiler | Tile patching, re-tiling where required |
| Builder (general) | Overall coordination of making-good trades |

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Plasterboard installation (supply + labour) | $15 - $30 per m2 |
| Plastering a 3-bedroom house (full job) | $10,000 - $15,000 |
| Interior painting (per m2) | $18 - $60+ per m2 |
| Standard bedroom repaint (3x3.5m room) | $300 - $750 |
| Interior painting (3-bedroom house, Sydney) | $4,500 - $8,000 |
| Non-structural wall removal (small plasterboard) | $800 - $1,500+ |
| Non-structural wall removal (standard plasterboard) | $2,000 - $3,200+ |
| Non-structural wall removal (internal brick/masonry) | $3,000 - $5,000+ |

*Note: The above wall-removal figures typically include labour and rubbish removal but exclude rerouting services and post-demolition finishing.*

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Making good is almost always underestimated in renovation budgets. It is painstaking, time-consuming work.
- Colour matching existing paint is difficult. Homeowners should expect to repaint entire walls or rooms (not just patched spots) for a professional finish.
- Floor patching (especially heritage timber floors or matching discontinued tiles) can be surprisingly expensive.
- If the homeowner's quote from the demolition contractor says "strip out kitchen" -- making good the adjoining hallway, ceiling, and floor where the kitchen wall was is **not** included.

---

## 6.7 Pest Treatment

### What It Is

During demolition, it is common to discover live termite activity, termite damage, borer damage, or other pest infestations that were concealed within walls, floors, subfloor areas, or roof spaces. When this occurs, pest treatment becomes an urgent priority before construction can continue, because:

- Active termites will continue to damage retained structural timbers.
- Building over untreated termite activity creates a latent defect.
- Most building certifiers require evidence of pest treatment and/or a termite management system before issuing an Occupation Certificate.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- Pest treatment requires a licensed pest controller (not a demolition contractor).
- The presence and extent of pest activity is unknown until demolition exposes concealed areas (a latent condition).
- The type of treatment required depends on the species, extent of infestation, soil conditions, and building design -- all factors outside the demolition contractor's expertise.
- Most renovation projects will require a termite management system (chemical or physical barrier) as part of the new build, regardless of what is found during demolition. This is a building compliance item, not a demolition item.

### Who Handles It

- **Inspection and identification:** Licensed pest controller / timber pest inspector.
- **Treatment (active termites):** Licensed pest controller.
- **Termite management system (new build requirement):** Licensed pest controller, often coordinated with the builder.
- **Structural timber repair/replacement (if damage is found):** Carpenter or builder, designed by structural engineer if significant.

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Termite inspection | $240 - $500 |
| Spot / localised treatment | $300 - $900 |
| Chemical soil barrier (full property) | $1,800 - $4,000 |
| Physical termite barrier (full property) | $2,000 - $4,000 |
| Termite baiting system (initial install) | $2,500 - $3,500 |
| Termite baiting system (annual monitoring) | $800 - $1,000 per year |
| General termite treatment range | $70 - $1,530 (depending on method and severity) |

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Termite damage is extremely common in Australian homes, particularly in coastal and subtropical regions.
- If active termites are found during demolition, **work should stop in the affected area** until a pest controller has assessed and treated the problem.
- Termite damage to structural timbers (bearers, joists, studs, top plates) may require a structural engineer to assess whether the retained structure is safe, adding further cost.
- Australian Building Code (NCC) requires all new building work to include a termite management system -- this is a compliance cost that sits with the builder, not the demolition contractor.
- Budget a contingency of $2,000 - $5,000 for unexpected pest issues in any renovation of a pre-1990 home.

---

## 6.8 Remediation of Water Damage or Mould

### What It Is

When walls, ceilings, or subfloor areas are opened up during demolition, it is not uncommon to discover:

- **Mould growth:** Often behind plasterboard, in wall cavities, under flooring, or in ceiling spaces. Caused by moisture ingress from leaking roofs, plumbing failures, poor ventilation, or rising damp.
- **Water damage:** Rotted timber framing, swollen or delaminated MDF/particleboard, corroded steel, stained and degraded insulation, or saturated masonry.
- **Moisture in subfloor:** Standing water, high humidity, or damp soil under the building.

Since 2025, Australia has adopted the AS-IICRC S520:2025 standard for professional mould remediation, which sets benchmark requirements for assessment, containment, removal, and clearance testing.

### Why It Is Excluded from a Standard Demolition Quote

- Mould remediation is a specialist activity requiring specific containment, PPE, HEPA filtration, and treatment protocols (now governed by AS-IICRC S520:2025).
- The extent of mould or water damage is typically concealed and unknown until demolition exposes it (a latent condition).
- Remediation may require involvement of a building scientist, hygienist, or waterproofing specialist -- none of whom are part of a demolition crew.
- If mould is disturbed without proper containment, spores can spread throughout the home, creating a health hazard and a much larger remediation scope.

### Who Handles It

| Activity | Who Handles It |
|----------|---------------|
| Mould assessment / inspection | Licensed mould assessor, building scientist, or occupational hygienist |
| Mould remediation (removal) | Specialist mould remediation company |
| Water damage restoration | Water damage restoration company (IICRC-certified) |
| Structural timber assessment (if rot found) | Structural engineer |
| Waterproofing rectification | Licensed waterproofer |
| Plumbing repairs (if leak caused the problem) | Licensed plumber |

### Approximate Cost Ranges

| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Mould inspection / assessment | $200 - $800 |
| Minor mould remediation (small area, <10 m2) | $200 - $800 |
| Moderate mould remediation (10-50 m2) | $800 - $1,500 |
| Severe mould remediation (>50 m2, structural involvement) | $1,500 - $6,000+ |
| Water damage restoration (minor, single room) | $1,500 - $3,500 |
| Water damage restoration (moderate, several rooms) | $3,500 - $7,000 |
| Air quality testing (post-remediation clearance) | $200 - $800 |
| Preventative measures (dehumidifiers, ventilation, waterproofing) | $150 - $1,000 |

### Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware

- Mould is a health hazard. Exposure to mould spores can cause respiratory illness, allergic reactions, and exacerbate asthma. It must be treated seriously.
- If mould is found during demolition and disturbed without containment, it can contaminate the entire house, turning a $1,000 remediation job into a $10,000+ problem.
- Water damage to structural framing (studs, bearers, joists) may require a structural engineer to assess whether the retained timber is sound, adding engineering fees on top of remediation costs.
- Insurance may cover mould or water damage remediation if it resulted from a sudden event (e.g., burst pipe), but typically **will not cover** gradual deterioration or maintenance-related moisture issues.
- Budget a contingency of $1,500 - $5,000 for potential mould/water damage remediation in any renovation of an older home.

---

## 6.9 Additional Common Exclusions

### 6.9.1 Soil Contamination

**What It Is:** During excavation or demolition of slab-on-ground structures, contaminated soil may be encountered. Contamination sources include historical use of pesticides (e.g., organochlorines used for termite treatment), lead paint flakes in soil around the building perimeter, buried asbestos fragments, fuel or oil spills (if the property had a workshop or fuel storage), or unknown fill material.

**Who Handles It:** Environmental consultant (assessment), specialist remediation contractor (removal/treatment).

**Approximate Cost Ranges:**
| Item | Cost Range (AUD) |
|------|-----------------|
| Soil contamination testing (standard residential) | $500 - $800+ (excl. GST) |
| Soil remediation -- excavation and disposal | $80 - $150 per m3 |
| Soil remediation -- screening (asbestos) | $50 - $120 per m3 |
| Soil remediation -- soil washing | $100 - $200 per m3 |
| Soil remediation -- thermal desorption | $300+ per m3 |

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** If contaminated soil is discovered, it must be disposed of at a licensed facility (not standard landfill). This can add thousands of dollars to excavation costs. The homeowner bears the cost unless the contamination was caused by a third party. Local council may need to be notified.

---

### 6.9.2 Underground Services and Unknown Infrastructure

**What It Is:** Underground services (water mains, sewer, stormwater, gas, electricity, telecommunications) may run through or adjacent to the demolition zone in locations that differ from plans or are completely undocumented. Old septic tanks, cesspits, underground fuel tanks, or buried rubble from previous construction may also be encountered.

**Who Handles It:** Before You Dig Australia (BYDA) should be contacted for a free dial-before-you-dig enquiry. Licensed plumbers, electricians, and utility providers handle any relocation or repair of damaged services.

**Approximate Cost:** Highly variable. Hitting an underground water main or sewer can result in emergency repair costs of $2,000 - $10,000+. Relocating an underground power cable can cost $5,000 - $20,000+.

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** A free BYDA enquiry should be lodged **before** any demolition or excavation work. The demolition contractor will typically exclude liability for damage to underground services not shown on BYDA plans (unforeseen conditions). The homeowner may bear the cost of repair.

---

### 6.9.3 Unforeseen or Latent Conditions

**What It Is:** A latent condition is any site condition that could not reasonably have been foreseen by the contractor at the time of quoting. Under Australian contract law, these are a significant risk allocation issue. Common examples in residential demolition include:

- Concealed asbestos (behind cladding, under tiles, in wall cavities)
- Structural defects not visible before demolition (cracked foundations, corroded steel, rotten timber)
- Illegal or non-compliant building work by previous owners
- Unexpected double-brick construction behind plasterboard
- Concealed services (wiring, plumbing) running through walls to be demolished
- Rock or hard material beneath slab-on-ground

**Who Bears the Cost:** This depends on the contract. Most demolition quotes include a clause excluding liability for latent conditions. The homeowner typically bears the additional cost unless a fixed-price contract specifically allocates the risk to the contractor.

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** Every demolition quote should be read carefully for latent conditions clauses. A prudent homeowner should budget a **contingency of 10-20%** of the demolition cost for unforeseen conditions. The AI scope generator should flag this prominently.

---

### 6.9.4 Tree Removal and Root Systems

**What It Is:** Trees within or adjacent to the demolition zone may need to be removed, lopped, or have root systems managed. Many councils have tree preservation orders (TPOs) that restrict removal of trees above a certain size or species.

**Who Handles It:** A qualified arborist for assessment and removal. Council for tree removal permits.

**Approximate Cost:** Tree removal ranges from $500 - $5,000+ depending on size, species, and access. Council tree removal permit fees are typically $50 - $300.

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** Removing a protected tree without council approval can result in fines of $10,000 - $1,000,000+ (in some jurisdictions). Trees near boundaries may also require neighbour notification. Root systems can interfere with foundations and services.

---

### 6.9.5 Skip Bins and Waste Disposal Beyond Standard Allowances

**What It Is:** While most demolition quotes include a waste disposal allowance, the actual volume of waste may exceed what was quoted. Additional skip bins, tip fees for specific waste streams (concrete, bricks, timber, metal, mixed waste), and disposal of unexpected materials (e.g., old concrete footings, buried rubble) may incur extra charges.

**Who Handles It:** The demolition contractor (usually as a variation) or the homeowner directly via a skip bin hire company.

**Approximate Cost:** Additional skip bins cost $300 - $1,000+ each depending on size. Tip fees for mixed waste are typically $200 - $350 per tonne. Clean fill is cheaper at $50 - $100 per tonne.

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** Check the demolition quote carefully for what waste disposal is included (number of bins, tonnage allowance, waste types). Ask specifically about "excess waste" pricing.

---

### 6.9.6 Hazardous Materials Beyond Asbestos

**What It Is:** Other hazardous materials that may be encountered during demolition include:
- **Lead paint** (common in pre-1970 homes)
- **Synthetic Mineral Fibres (SMF)** such as fibreglass or rockwool insulation
- **Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)** in old electrical equipment or caulking
- **Formaldehyde** in certain insulation products or particleboard

**Who Handles It:** Licensed hazardous materials removalist or environmental consultant.

**Approximate Cost:** Lead paint removal typically costs $20 - $60 per m2. SMF removal is usually handled as part of general demolition but with appropriate PPE. PCB removal is a specialist activity costing $5,000+ depending on scope.

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** These materials are less commonly discussed than asbestos but carry real health risks. If the home was built before 1970, assume lead paint is present. The demolition contractor's quote may exclude handling of all hazardous materials, not just asbestos.

### 6.9.7 Neighbour Notification, Party Wall, and Boundary Issues

**What It Is:** Demolition near a shared boundary or party wall may require:
- Formal neighbour notification (required by some councils and under various state legislation)
- Dilapidation reports on neighbouring properties (photographic/video record of the neighbour's property condition before work starts)
- Party wall agreements or engineering for shared walls
- Boundary survey to confirm the exact property boundary before demolition

**Who Handles It:** The homeowner (neighbour notification), a building inspector or surveyor (dilapidation report), a registered surveyor (boundary survey), a structural engineer (party wall engineering).

**Approximate Cost:** Dilapidation reports cost $500 - $2,000 per neighbouring property. Boundary surveys cost $500 - $1,500. Party wall engineering is project-specific.

**Why Homeowners Need to Be Aware:** Failure to notify neighbours or document pre-existing conditions can result in costly disputes and legal claims. Some councils require a dilapidation report as a condition of DA consent.

## Key Recommendations for the AI Scope Generator

1. **Always flag asbestos as a potential exclusion** for any home built before 1990. Include a prompt asking whether an asbestos survey has been completed.
2. **Always include a line item for structural engineering** if any load-bearing elements are being removed or modified.
3. **Always separate council/certification fees** from the demolition quote and provide estimated ranges based on the project's estimated development cost and state.
4. **Always prompt the homeowner about service disconnection lead times** -- this is the most common cause of demolition delays.
5. **Include a contingency line item of 10-20%** for latent conditions on every scope generated.
6. **Flag making-good costs** as a separate budget line whenever partial demolition is involved (i.e., the home is not being fully demolished).
7. **For pre-1970 homes**, flag lead paint as an additional hazardous material risk.
8. **For homes in termite-prone regions** (most of coastal and northern Australia), flag pest treatment as a likely additional cost.
