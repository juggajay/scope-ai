- Air monitoring is mandatory -- budget $500--$1,500 additional.
- Disposal fees at licensed facilities: $300--$700.
- Friable asbestos is uncommon in typical residential bathroom/kitchen renovation scopes. Most commonly encountered as pipe lagging, old boiler insulation, or heavily degraded fibro cement.

## 7.13 Ceiling Removal (Per m2)

Removal and disposal of existing ceiling material. Includes waste removal.

| Ceiling Type | Low | Mid | High | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Plasterboard** (standard Gyprock) | $15 | $25 | $40 | Medium-High |
| **Lath and plaster** (older homes) | $25 | $40 | $60 | Medium |
| **Fibro cement** (no asbestos) | $20 | $35 | $50 | Medium |
| **Decorative/ornate plaster** | $30 | $50 | $80 | Medium |

### City Price Guide -- Ceiling Removal Per m2 (Plasterboard)

| City | Low | Mid | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sydney | $18 | $30 | $45 |
| Melbourne | $15 | $25 | $40 |
| Brisbane | $14 | $23 | $38 |
| Perth | $15 | $25 | $40 |
| Adelaide | $12 | $22 | $35 |
| Canberra | $15 | $25 | $40 |
| Hobart | $12 | $22 | $35 |
| Darwin | $18 | $30 | $50 |

**Notes:**
- If the ceiling contains asbestos (common in pre-1990 homes), this becomes an asbestos removal job (see 7.7/7.8) and prices increase substantially.
- Lath and plaster removal generates significantly more dust and debris than plasterboard.
- Access considerations: Standard ceiling height (2.4m) is baseline. Higher ceilings or restricted access may add 20--40%.
- Insulation removal/disposal (if present above ceiling): Add $5--$15/m2.

**Sources:** ServiceTasker (2026), Trade Heroes, RapidQS, ServicesSeekng Plastering (2024), Oneflare Plastering (2024), Paul's Plastering Sydney, Perth Ceiling and Walls.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH -- Less directly quoted than flooring removal; many sources combine removal with replacement pricing.

## 7.14 Site Protection Setup

Temporary protection measures to contain dust, protect existing finishes, and provide safe work areas during demolition and renovation. Costs depend on the extent of protection required.

| Item | Low | Mid | High | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Floor protection** (correx/cardboard, per m2) | $3 | $5 | $8 | Medium-High |
| **Wall protection** (foam/correx, per m2) | $2 | $4 | $6 | Medium |
| **Dust barrier walls** (plastic sheeting + ZipWall, per m2) | $10 | $15 | $25 | Medium |
| **ZipWall system setup** (per opening/doorway) | $80 | $150 | $250 | Medium |
| **Corridor protection** (full wrap, per linear metre) | $15 | $25 | $40 | Medium |
| **Stairway protection** (per flight) | $100 | $200 | $350 | Medium |
| **Lift protection** (per lift car) | $200 | $400 | $600 | Medium |

### Typical Total Site Protection Costs by Project Type

| Scenario | Low | Mid | High | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Single bathroom reno** (ground floor house) | $150 | $350 | $600 | Medium |
| **Kitchen reno** (ground floor house) | $200 | $500 | $800 | Medium |
| **Apartment bathroom reno** (with corridor/lift) | $400 | $800 | $1,500 | Medium |
| **Whole-house strip-out** (ground floor) | $500 | $1,000 | $2,000 | Medium |

**Notes:**
- Apartment buildings and strata complexes typically require more extensive protection (common areas, lifts, corridors).
- Many demolition contractors include basic site protection in their strip-out quote.
- ZipWall systems ($300--$600 to purchase) are often owned by the contractor and charged as a setup/hire fee.
- Additional costs may include building management fees in apartments ($200--$500) and council/strata permits.
- After-hours work in apartments may require additional protection measures.

**Sources:** Master Strip Outs Sydney (2025), Restore Solutions, All Preparation Equipment, Clean Wrap, ZipWall.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM -- Site protection is rarely quoted as a standalone line item in published pricing. Data derived from trade supplier pricing and industry knowledge. Actual costs vary significantly by site conditions.
