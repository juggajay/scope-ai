# Painting: Homeowner Mistakes & DIY Considerations

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Inform scope-of-works AI generation for ScopeAI — painting trade. This document covers DIY vs professional trade-offs, common DIY mistakes, scope specification mistakes homeowners make when commissioning a painter, and red flags when hiring.
**Confidence:** High. Painting is the most widely documented residential trade in Australia. Data sourced from Australian painting contractors, industry bodies (Master Painters Australia), paint manufacturers (Dulux, Taubmans, Haymes, Resene, Wattyl), and consumer resources (Bunnings, Airtasker, hipages). Cost figures are 2025-2026 market rates.

## 1. DIY vs Professional — Realistic Comparison

Painting is the single most common DIY trade in Australia. However, the gap between DIY and professional results is larger than most homeowners expect.

### 1.1 Quality Difference

| Factor | DIY Homeowner | Professional Painter |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Cutting in (ceiling/trim lines) | Wobbly, uneven — most visible flaw | Crisp, straight lines freehand |
| Roller finish | Lap marks, uneven coverage, texture inconsistency | Smooth, even, consistent sheen |
| Preparation | Often skipped or partial | Full wash, sand, fill, prime per AS/NZS 2311 |
| Coating system | May skip primer, do one coat | Correct primer + 2 topcoats minimum |
| Clean-up | Drips on trim, paint on fixtures, overspray | Clean edges, protected surfaces, no drips |
| Durability | 3-5 years before showing wear | 7-10+ years with proper system |

**Key insight:** From 2 metres away, a DIY repaint can look acceptable. Up close and in raking light (morning/evening sun along the wall), every flaw is visible — roller marks, missed spots, uneven sheen, wobbly cut-in lines.

### 1.2 Time Comparison — Standard Bedroom (approx. 12m2 floor, ~40m2 wall area)

| Task | DIY Homeowner | Professional (2-person team) |
|------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Move furniture / protect floor | 1-2 hours | 30-45 min |
| Preparation (wash, sand, fill, tape) | 2-3 hours | 45 min - 1.5 hours |
| Primer coat (if needed) | 1-2 hours + drying | 30-45 min + drying |
| First topcoat (cut in + roll) | 2-4 hours + drying | 1-1.5 hours + drying |
| Second topcoat | 2-4 hours + drying | 1-1.5 hours + drying |
| Clean-up and restore room | 1-2 hours | 30-45 min |
| **Total elapsed time** | **1.5-2 full days** (including drying) | **1 day** (including drying) |
| **Total labour hours** | **10-16 hours** | **5-8 hours** (combined person-hours) |

Professional painters are approximately 40% faster than DIY homeowners on equivalent tasks. They are more efficient because of practised technique, commercial-grade equipment, and working in pairs (one cuts in while the other rolls).

### 1.3 Cost Comparison — Single Standard Bedroom Repaint

| Cost Item | DIY | Professional |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Paint (2 x 4L premium, walls + ceiling) | $160-$240 | Included |
| Primer (if needed, 4L) | $60-$90 | Included |
| Brushes, rollers, trays, tape | $80-$120 (first time) | Included |
| Drop sheets, masking tape, sugar soap | $40-$60 | Included |
| Ladder (if not owned) | $80-$150 hire or purchase | Included |
| **Total DIY materials** | **$340-$660** | — |
| **Professional quote (same room)** | — | **$800-$1,500** |
| **Typical saving from DIY** | **$400-$900** | — |

**Notes:**
- DIY cost drops significantly for second room onward (tools already purchased)
- Professional quotes include labour (~60%), materials (~25%), and preparation (~15%)
- Professionals buy paint at trade prices (20-30% less than retail)
- Professional per-square-metre rates in Australia: $20-$45/m2 for interior walls including prep, two coats, and touch-ups (2025-2026 rates)

### 1.4 When DIY Is Acceptable

- **Single-colour repaint of a bedroom** — same or very similar colour, existing paint in good condition
- **Small touch-ups** — patching and repainting a small wall section
- **Feature wall** — single wall, single colour, no cutting in against different colours
- **Garden shed or garage** — lower finish expectations
- **Furniture painting** — small-scale, controlled environment

### 1.5 When DIY Is NOT Recommended

| Scenario | Why Professional Is Better |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **High ceilings (3m+)** | Safety risk — ladders/scaffolding required, fall hazard. Scaffolding should be professionally assembled |
| **New plasterboard (gyprock)** | Requires specific sealer (not "paint and primer in one"), correct application per AS/NZS 2311. Flashing/sheen banding if done wrong |
| **Spray application** | Requires commercial equipment, skill, and complete masking of all surfaces. Overspray is difficult to control |
| **Wet areas (bathroom, kitchen, laundry)** | Requires mould-resistant paint, correct sheen selection, proper ventilation consideration |
| **Dark-to-light colour change** | Requires tinted primer + multiple topcoats (potentially 4-5 coats total). Time-consuming and easy to get wrong |
| **Light-to-dark colour change** | Requires tinted primer to avoid patchiness. Dark colours show every roller mark and lap line |
| **Large open-plan areas** | Maintaining a wet edge across large wall spans is very difficult for amateurs — lap marks are almost guaranteed |
| **Exterior painting** | Height, weather dependency, surface prep complexity, and need for proper scaffolding/harness systems |
| **Heritage or detailed trim/cornice work** | Requires steady hand, specialist brushes, and patience most DIYers underestimate |
| **Multi-colour schemes** | Each colour change requires full masking, separate tools, and careful sequencing |

---

## 2. Most Common DIY Mistakes

### 2.1 Insufficient Preparation

The single most impactful mistake. Preparation accounts for 60-80% of a professional paint job's quality.

- **Skipping the sugar soap wash** — Grease, dust, and grime prevent paint adhesion. Walls must be washed with sugar soap solution (1/2 cup per 10L warm water), wiped top-to-bottom, rinsed with clean water, and dried completely before painting
- **Not sanding** — Glossy or semi-gloss existing paint must be lightly sanded (220-grit) to provide a key for new paint. AS/NZS 2311 requires all sound gloss and semi-gloss surfaces to be sanded to a matt finish
- **Not filling holes and cracks** — Every nail hole, crack, and dent must be filled, allowed to dry, then sanded smooth. Unfilled imperfections show through paint and look worse with a fresh coat
- **Not priming** — Bare surfaces, repairs, stains, and colour changes all require primer. See Section 2.6

### 2.2 Wrong Paint Type for the Surface

- **Using wall paint (low sheen) on trim/doors** — Trim and doors need semi-gloss or gloss for durability and cleanability. Low sheen on trim scuffs and marks easily
- **Using interior paint outside** — Interior paint lacks UV stabilisers and weather resistance. It will chalk, fade, and peel within 12-24 months
- **Using flat/matt paint in wet areas** — Bathrooms, kitchens, and laundries need semi-gloss or dedicated kitchen/bathroom paint (e.g., Dulux Wash&Wear Kitchen & Bathroom, Haymes Ultra Premium) with mould-resistant additives
- **Using exterior paint inside** — Exterior paint has stronger odour, higher VOC content, and is formulated differently. Not suitable for occupied interiors

**Correct sheen selection for Australian interiors:**

| Surface | Recommended Sheen | Why |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Ceilings | Flat / Matt | Hides imperfections, reduces glare |
| Walls — bedrooms, living | Low Sheen | Soft finish, washable, hides minor wall imperfections |
| Walls — hallways, kids' rooms | Low Sheen or Satin | More durable, easier to clean |
| Walls — bathroom, kitchen, laundry | Semi-Gloss (or dedicated Kitchen & Bathroom paint) | Moisture resistant, mould resistant, easy to clean |
| Doors | Semi-Gloss or Gloss | Durable, easy to wipe, highlights joinery detail |
| Skirtings & architraves | Semi-Gloss or Gloss | Durable, easy to clean, provides contrast to walls |
| Window frames & sills | Semi-Gloss or Gloss | Weather and condensation resistance |

### 2.3 Not Enough Coats

- **Expecting one coat to cover** — One coat of paint almost never provides full, even coverage, especially when changing colours. Two coats minimum is the industry standard (AS/NZS 2311)
- **Colour change situations** — Dark to light requires tinted primer + 2-3 topcoats. Light to dark requires tinted primer + 2 topcoats. Without primer, you may need 4-5 topcoats to achieve solid coverage
- **Bare surfaces** — AS/NZS 2311 requires a minimum of three coats on any bare plaster or timber surface (1 sealer/primer + 2 topcoats)

### 2.4 Poor Cutting In

- **Wobbly lines at ceiling junctions** — The most visible evidence of amateur painting. Professionals cut in freehand with an angled brush; DIYers often use tape (which can bleed) or attempt freehand with poor results
- **Using the wrong brush** — Cutting in requires a quality 50-63mm (2-2.5 inch) angled sash brush. Cheap brushes lose bristles, don't hold a line, and splay
- **Loading the brush wrong** — Dipping too deep causes drips; not enough paint causes dragging and skipping

### 2.5 Roller Marks and Lap Lines

- **Wrong roller nap** — The most common equipment mistake

| Surface | Correct Nap Size | Common DIY Mistake |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Smooth walls (plasterboard) | 10-12mm | Using 18-20mm (too textured) |
| Ceilings | 18-20mm | Using wall roller (not enough coverage) |
| Doors and trim | 4-6mm foam or mohair | Using wall roller (too textured) |
| Textured surfaces (render, bagged brick) | 18-26mm | Using smooth roller (won't reach into texture) |

- **Not maintaining a wet edge** — If paint begins to dry before the adjacent section is rolled, a visible "lap line" forms. Must work in sections and always roll back into the wet edge
- **Overworking the paint** — Going back over partially dried paint creates ridges, marks, and uneven sheen. Apply and move on
- **Not back-rolling** — Each section should be finished with light, unloaded passes in one direction to even out the coating

### 2.6 Not Using Primer on New Surfaces

This is especially critical in renovation contexts where new plasterboard is common.

- **New plasterboard (gyprock)** — Requires a dedicated plasterboard sealer (e.g., Dulux 1 Step Prep, Zinsser Peel Stop). "Paint and Primer in One" products are NOT a substitute — they do not properly seal the porous plasterboard surface. Without proper sealer, the result is "flashing" or "sheen banding" — visible stripes where joint compound and paper absorb paint differently
- **New timber** — Requires timber primer to seal the grain and prevent tannin bleed
- **Patched areas** — Filler and repair compound are more porous than surrounding paint. Must be spot-primed or the patches will show as dull spots ("photographing")
- **Stains** — Water stains, smoke stains, and tannin bleed require a stain-blocking primer (e.g., Zinsser B-I-N shellac-based) before topcoating

### 2.7 Painting in Wrong Conditions

Australian climate creates specific challenges:

| Condition | Problem | Guideline |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Temperature below 10 degrees C** | Water-based paint won't cure properly; may not dry at all | Do not paint below 10 degrees C |
| **Temperature above 35 degrees C** | Paint dries too fast; causes lap marks, brush drag, poor adhesion | Do not paint above 35 degrees C. Ideal: 15-25 degrees C |
| **Direct sunlight on surface** | Causes "flash drying" — paint skins over but doesn't cure underneath | Paint in shade; follow the sun around the house for exteriors |
| **Humidity above 85%** | Paint won't dry, may sag, run, or fail to adhere | Do not paint above 85% humidity. Ideal: 40-50% |
| **Rain expected within 2-4 hours** | Exterior paint needs minimum drying time before exposure to moisture | Check forecast; allow 2-4 hours minimum for water-based paint |
| **Northern Australia monsoon season (Nov-Apr)** | High humidity + rain makes exterior painting extremely risky | Best exterior painting months: dry season (May-Oct) |
| **Morning dew / condensation** | Surface moisture prevents adhesion | Wait for surfaces to dry completely; don't start too early |

### 2.8 Cheap Brushes and Rollers

- **False economy** — A $5 roller sleeve sheds fibres into the paint finish, leaves uneven texture, and holds less paint (requiring more dipping and more time). A quality $15-$20 roller cover delivers a noticeably better result
- **Cheap brushes** — Lose bristles in the paint, won't hold a clean edge for cutting in, splay after minimal use
- **Minimum quality recommendation** — Mid-range Australian brands (Monarch, Supercoat, Hamilton) are sufficient. No need for the most expensive, but avoid the cheapest
- **False economy calculation** — If a $5 roller causes enough issues to require an extra coat of paint ($80-$120 in materials), the "saving" has cost money

### 2.9 Not Removing Switch Plates and Outlet Covers

- Takes 2 minutes per plate with a screwdriver
- Paint on switch plates and outlet covers is the most common sign of amateur work
- Also remove curtain hardware, picture hooks, and light fittings where practical
- Turn off power at the circuit breaker before removing electrical plates

### 2.10 Drips on Trim and Doors

- **Too much paint on the brush** — Should only dip the brush 1/3 into the paint and tap off excess
- **Not back-brushing** — Trim and doors should be finished with light strokes in one direction to smooth out the coating
- **Wrong applicator** — Doors are best done with a small foam or short-nap roller, with brush for edges only. Using a brush for the entire door surface almost always leaves brush marks
- **Painting horizontal surfaces (door tops, window sills)** — Gravity causes drips on the underside. Must check back after 5-10 minutes and brush out any runs

---

## 3. Scope Specification Mistakes (Homeowner Commissioning a Painter)

These are mistakes homeowners make when defining the scope of work — critical for the AI scope generator to avoid.

### 3.1 Not Specifying the Number of Coats

- **The mistake:** Assuming the painter will apply "enough" coats without specifying
- **The problem:** Unscrupulous painters will apply one coat if not explicitly told otherwise
- **What the scope should say:** "Minimum 2 coats of [brand/product] topcoat to all surfaces, plus primer/sealer where required on new or bare surfaces"
- **AS/NZS 2311 standard:** Sealer + 2 topcoats on bare surfaces; 2 topcoats on sound previously painted surfaces

### 3.2 Assuming One Coat Is Enough

- One coat almost never provides full, even, durable coverage
- Even "one coat" paint products typically require two coats for a professional result
- Colour changes always require multiple coats (often with tinted primer)
- The scope should never specify fewer than 2 topcoats for any surface

### 3.3 Not Specifying Which Surfaces Are Included

- **The mistake:** Saying "paint the kitchen" without defining exactly what that means
- **Ambiguous items that must be explicitly included or excluded:**

| Surface | Include? Must Be Explicit |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Walls | Almost always included — but specify which walls if not all |
| Ceiling | Often forgotten. Must be explicitly included if desired |
| Trim (skirtings, architraves, window frames) | Often assumed by homeowner but not by painter. Must specify |
| Doors (both sides? just one? frames?) | Must specify: "door face, edges, frame, and architrave" |
| Built-in cupboard/wardrobe doors | Often missed. Specify if included |
| Splashback areas | May be tiled; specify if paintable splashback exists |
| Bulkheads / soffits | Easily missed in scope |
| Hallway connecting to room | Where does "the kitchen" end? Define boundaries clearly |

### 3.4 Not Specifying the Number of Colours

- **Each additional colour = additional cost** — every colour change requires tool cleaning or new tools, masking, and more time
- **Common underestimate:** Homeowner wants walls in one colour, ceiling in white, trim in a third colour — that is three colours, not one
- **What the scope should specify:** "Walls: [Colour A]. Ceiling: [Colour B]. All trim, doors, and frames: [Colour C]" with exact colour codes

### 3.5 Forgetting Ceilings in the Scope

- Ceilings are the most commonly forgotten surface in painting scopes
- A freshly painted wall next to a dirty or yellowed ceiling looks worse than the original
- Ceilings are more time-consuming and physically demanding than walls (overhead work)
- If ceilings are not included, the scope should explicitly state "ceilings excluded" so there is no ambiguity

### 3.6 Not Planning for Touch-Ups After Other Trades

- In a renovation context, painting is typically done before final fixture installation (appliances, cabinetry hardware, light fittings, towel rails)
- Other trades will inevitably mark the walls during installation
- The scope should include a touch-up allowance: "Final touch-up visit after all trades complete" or explicitly exclude it

### 3.7 Not Specifying Paint Brand and Grade

- **Builder grade vs premium paint** makes a visible, lasting difference

| Factor | Builder Grade (~$40-$60/4L) | Premium Grade (~$80-$120/4L) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Coverage | May require 3+ coats | Usually full coverage in 2 coats |
| Washability | Marks easily, hard to clean | Scrub-resistant, stain-resistant |
| Durability | 3-5 years | 7-10+ years |
| Colour consistency | May vary between batches | Tight colour control |
| Touch-up | Obvious patches | Blends better |
| Examples | Generic "trade" brands | Dulux Wash&Wear, Taubmans Endure, Haymes Ultra Premium |

- **What the scope should say:** "All paints to be [Brand] [Product Line] or equivalent premium quality" with specific product names
- **Common scam:** Cheap painters insist on using "their" paint — may be watered down (adding 2+ litres of water per 10L tin instead of the manufacturer's 200-400ml recommendation) or cheap unbranded product

### 3.8 Assuming the Painter Will Move All Furniture

- Most painters expect rooms to be cleared or furniture moved to the centre and covered before they arrive
- If furniture moving is required, it must be explicitly included in the scope and will add to the cost
- Heavy items (pianos, large bookshelves, wall units) may require separate removalists
- The scope should state either "Homeowner to clear rooms prior to painting" or "Painter to move and protect all furniture"

### 3.9 Not Understanding What "Preparation" Means

Most homeowners think preparation means "putting drop sheets down." Professional preparation includes:

1. **Washing** — Sugar soap solution to all surfaces
2. **Sanding** — Lightly sand all glossy surfaces for adhesion key
3. **Filling** — All holes, cracks, nail pops, and imperfections filled with appropriate filler
4. **Sanding repairs** — Filled areas sanded smooth and flush
5. **Caulking** — Gaps between trim and walls re-caulked where needed
6. **Masking** — Tape and protect all surfaces not being painted (floors, fixtures, windows)
7. **Priming** — Spot-prime repairs; full-prime bare surfaces and stains
8. **Protecting** — Drop sheets on floors, plastic over fixtures

**If you don't pay for preparation, you won't get preparation.** A quote that seems cheap is almost certainly skipping most of these steps. The scope should explicitly list each preparation step required.

### 3.10 Changing Colours After Painting Has Started

- Once a painter has purchased and opened paint, mixed custom colours, and begun application, changing the colour is extremely costly
- Already-painted surfaces must be repainted (additional coats on top of wrong colour)
- Paint that has been tinted cannot be returned to the store
- New paint must be purchased
- **Scope prevention:** Require colour sign-off on test patches before work begins. Note in scope: "All colours to be confirmed via sample patches prior to full application"

### 3.11 Not Specifying the Finish/Sheen for Each Surface

- Sheen is not just aesthetic — it affects durability, washability, and moisture resistance
- If not specified, the painter will choose (and may choose the cheapest or fastest option)
- **What the scope should include:**

```
Ceilings: Flat/Matt white (Dulux Ceiling White or equivalent)
Walls - living areas: Low Sheen (Dulux Wash&Wear Low Sheen or equivalent)
Walls - wet areas: Semi-Gloss (Dulux Wash&Wear Kitchen & Bathroom or equivalent)
Trim, doors, frames: Semi-Gloss or Gloss (Dulux Aquanamel or equivalent)
```

## 4. Red Flags When Hiring a Painter

### 4.1 Quote Seems Too Cheap

- If one quote is significantly below others (30%+ cheaper), the painter is likely cutting corners
- Common shortcuts: skipping preparation, applying one coat instead of two, using cheap/watered-down paint, not priming, rushing the job
- **Rule of thumb:** Get 3 quotes. If one is dramatically lower, treat it as a red flag, not a bargain
- In Australia (2025-2026), typical interior rates are $20-$45 per square metre for walls including prep, two coats, and touch-ups. Quotes below $15/m2 should raise concerns

### 4.2 Won't Specify Number of Coats in Writing

- A reputable painter will clearly state "2 coats" or "1 primer + 2 topcoats" in the quote
- If they are vague about coats ("as needed" or "until it covers"), they are leaving room to apply fewer
- **Non-negotiable:** The quote must state the exact number of coats for each surface type

### 4.3 No Written Scope or Quote Breakdown

- Verbal quotes are unenforceable and leave room for "I never said that"
- A professional quote should include:
  - Specific rooms/surfaces included
  - Number of coats per surface type
  - Paint brand and product
  - Preparation steps included
  - Start date and estimated duration
  - Total price (or per-room pricing)
  - What is excluded
  - Payment terms
- If a painter will not provide a written, itemised quote, do not proceed

### 4.4 Wants to Use "Their" Paint

- **Legitimate scenario:** Many professional painters buy paint at trade price and include it in the quote — this is normal and acceptable if the brand and product are specified
- **Red flag:** The painter insists on using unnamed or unbranded paint, or will not tell you the brand. May indicate:
  - Watered-down paint (adding excessive water to stretch supply)
  - Cheap unbranded product repackaged into branded tins
  - Leftover paint from previous jobs mixed together
- **Protection:** Scope should specify "Paint to be [Brand X Product Y]. Painter to provide original tin labels or purchase receipts on request"

### 4.5 No Insurance or Licence

- **Licensing requirements by state (2025-2026):**

| State | Licence Required For | Threshold | Regulator |
|-------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| NSW | Residential painting work | Over $5,000 (incl GST) | NSW Fair Trading |
| QLD | Residential painting work | Over $3,300 (incl GST) | QBCC |
| VIC | Residential painting work | Over $5,000 (incl GST) | Victorian Building Authority |
| SA | Building work including painting | Over $5,000 | Consumer & Business Services |
| WA | Painting work | Over $20,000 | Building Services Board |
| TAS | Building work including painting | Over $5,000 | Consumer, Building & Occupational Services |

- All states require Certificate III in Painting and Decorating (CPC30620) as minimum qualification for licensed painters
- **Public liability insurance** — A painter should carry minimum $5-10 million public liability. If they damage your property or a third party is injured, you could be liable without it
- **Workers compensation** — Required if they have employees. If an uninsured worker is injured on your property, you may be liable
- **Always ask for:** Licence number (verify online with relevant state authority), current certificate of insurance

### 4.6 Quoting by the Hour Instead of by the Job

- **Hourly rate quotes create a perverse incentive** — the slower the painter works, the more they earn
- Professional painters quote by the job (fixed price) or by the square metre
- Hourly rates also make it impossible to compare quotes accurately
- **Exception:** Very small or uncertain-scope jobs (e.g., "touch up a few spots") may legitimately be quoted hourly
- **If hourly is quoted:** Typical painter rates in Australia are $50-$80/hour (2025-2026). Insist on a maximum hours cap in writing

### 4.7 Additional Red Flags

- **Demands large upfront deposit** — Industry standard is 10-20% deposit. More than 30% is a red flag. Never pay 100% upfront
- **No references or portfolio** — Any established painter should be able to provide references or photos of recent work
- **Pressure to sign immediately** — "This price is only good today" is a high-pressure sales tactic
- **No ABN** — All legitimate Australian businesses must have an ABN. No ABN = cash-in-hand operator, no consumer protections
- **Bad online reviews** — Check Google, ProductReview, hipages, and Airtasker reviews. Patterns of complaint about quality or unfinished work are significant
- **Won't do a walk-through** — A professional painter needs to inspect the site to give an accurate quote. Phone/photo quotes are unreliable

---

## 5. Key Takeaways for AI Scope Generation

The AI scope generator should ensure every painting scope includes:

1. **Explicit surface list** — Every surface to be painted, named individually (walls, ceiling, trim, doors, frames, built-ins)
2. **Number of coats per surface** — Minimum 2 topcoats; 1 sealer/primer + 2 topcoats on bare/new surfaces
3. **Paint specification** — Brand, product line, and sheen level for each surface type
4. **Colour specification** — Colour name and code for each surface, with note about sample patch sign-off
5. **Preparation requirements** — Explicitly list: wash, sand, fill, prime, caulk, mask
6. **Exclusions clearly stated** — If ceilings, trim, or specific rooms are excluded, state it
7. **Furniture responsibility** — Who moves and protects furniture
8. **Access requirements** — Scaffolding or platform requirements for high areas
9. **Touch-up provision** — Whether a return visit for touch-ups after other trades is included
10. **Conditions/timing** — Any requirements about painting conditions or sequencing with other trades
