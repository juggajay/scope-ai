# SECTION 3: Painting Scope Items by Area

> **Research date:** February 2026
>
> **Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for an AI scope-of-works generator covering painting scope items for Australian residential renovations. Each item includes what it involves, typical method, whether it is standard or conditional, safety/compliance requirements, and commonly forgotten items.
>
> **Applicable Standard:** AS/NZS 2311:2017 *Guide to the Painting of Buildings* (6th edition). This standard nominates a three-coat minimum system for bare surfaces (1 sealer/primer + 2 top coats) and is the recognised industry benchmark for all residential painting work in Australia. Master Painters Australia endorses this standard for all licensed painters.
>
> **Confidence note:** This research is based on current Australian painting standards, manufacturer technical data sheets (Dulux, Resene, Cabot's), Master Painters Association guidelines, and industry best practice as of February 2026. Product names are used as representative examples of their class -- equivalent products from other major Australian brands (Taubmans, British Paints, Haymes, Wattyl) are acceptable substitutes provided they meet the same performance specifications.

## A. Kitchen

### A1. Kitchen Walls

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting all wall surfaces in the kitchen area, including walls behind and around cabinetry, above splashbacks, and any exposed wall areas. Kitchen walls require a durable, washable finish to withstand grease, moisture, and regular cleaning. |
| **Typical method** | Clean walls with sugar soap solution and rinse. Lightly sand existing painted surfaces with 180-220 grit to provide a key. Fill any holes, cracks, or imperfections with lightweight filler, sand smooth when dry. Mask off cabinetry, splashbacks, windows, and adjacent surfaces. Apply paint by brush (cutting in at edges, corners, and around obstacles) and roller (10-12mm nap for smooth walls). |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted surfaces (good condition)** | Light sand, spot-prime any bare patches or filler with 1 coat acrylic primer/sealer, then 2 coats kitchen-grade acrylic (e.g. Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom Low Sheen or equivalent). No full primer coat needed if existing paint is sound and compatible. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat acrylic primer/sealer (e.g. Dulux 1 Step Prep or Dulux Precision Plasterboard Primer) applied by roller (10mm wool nap) or spray with mandatory back-roll. Then 2 coats kitchen-grade acrylic top coat. Minimum 3 coats total per AS/NZS 2311. |
| **Recommended finish** | Low sheen. Low sheen is the standard for kitchen walls -- it hides minor surface imperfections while still being wipeable. Semi-gloss is acceptable but shows wall imperfections more readily. |
| **Recommended product class** | Kitchen & bathroom grade acrylic with built-in mould inhibitor and scrubbable finish. Examples: Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom Low Sheen, Taubmans Easy Living Kitchen & Bathroom, Haymes Expressions Kitchen & Bathroom. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every kitchen painting scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | If existing paint is pre-1970, test for lead paint before sanding (lead paint was phased out in Australia by 1970 for interior use, fully banned 1997). If lead detected, wet-sand only, use P2 respirator, and follow AS 4361.2 lead paint guidelines. Ensure adequate ventilation during painting. Do not expose freshly painted surfaces to steam or condensation for minimum 48 hours. Allow 7 days full cure before heavy cleaning. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Walls behind the fridge recess (often not accessible until appliance is removed -- must be included in scope). Walls above overhead cabinets (visible if cabinets do not reach ceiling). Return walls at kitchen entries and pass-throughs. Bulkhead/soffit faces above cabinets. Wall areas that were concealed by old splashback -- these typically need repair and full primer system before top-coating. Colour matching if only painting some walls -- specify whether full room or partial. |

---

### A2. Kitchen Ceiling

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting the full ceiling surface in the kitchen. Kitchen ceilings are subject to cooking fumes, grease vapour, and steam, making them prone to yellowing and mould if not painted with appropriate products. |
| **Typical method** | Lightly sand existing ceiling (if previously painted and in good condition). Spot-fill any cracks, nail pops, or imperfections. Apply ceiling paint by roller (10-12mm nap) working in consistent overlapping passes. Cut in at perimeter with brush. For new plasterboard ceilings, apply primer first by roller with back-roll. |
| **Coating system -- Existing** | Spot-prime repairs, then 2 coats ceiling paint with mould inhibitor. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat primer/sealer + 2 coats ceiling paint. 3 coats minimum. |
| **Recommended finish** | Flat/matt. Flat finish is standard for ceilings as it minimises light reflection and hides roller marks. Kitchen ceilings benefit from a washable flat or matt with mould resistance. |
| **Recommended product class** | Ceiling-specific paint with mould inhibitor. Examples: Dulux Ceiling White +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom, Dulux Wash&Wear Matt (kitchen-grade alternative), Taubmans Easy Living Ceiling. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every kitchen painting scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Working at height -- use stable platform or scaffolding, not a ladder leaned against the wall. Protect floors and benchtops from drips. Adequate ventilation required. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Ceiling areas above bulkheads/soffits (top surface visible from the room). Exhaust fan grille area -- paint up to and around the fan housing. Cornice/ceiling junction (specify whether cornice is painted ceiling colour or wall colour). Yellowed ceilings from cooking fumes may need a stain-blocking primer (shellac-based or dedicated stain blocker) before top-coating, otherwise discolouration bleeds through. |

---

### A3. Kitchen Trim and Architraves

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting all timber or MDF trim elements in the kitchen including door architraves, skirting boards (where exposed below cabinets or at kitchen entries), window architraves, and any decorative mouldings. |
| **Typical method** | Lightly sand with 180-220 grit. Fill any gaps, nail holes, or dents with acrylic filler. Spot-prime filler patches. Apply enamel by brush (50-63mm angled sash brush for architraves, smaller for detail) or mini-roller for flat skirting faces. Two coats minimum. Sand lightly between coats with 220-320 grit for best finish. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted trim** | Sand, spot-prime bare patches, then 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system -- New timber/MDF** | 1 coat oil-based or water-based primer/undercoat (e.g. Dulux 1 Step Prep or Dulux Professional Total Prep Sealer Undercoat) + 2 coats water-based enamel. 3 coats total. Pre-primed MDF profiles (common in new builds) still need 1 additional primer coat on site after installation, plus 2 top coats. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss. Semi-gloss is the industry standard for trim in kitchens -- it is durable, easy to wipe clean, and provides visual contrast against low-sheen walls. Gloss is acceptable but shows imperfections. |
| **Recommended product class** | Water-based enamel (non-yellowing). Examples: Dulux Aquanamel Semi Gloss, Resene Lustacryl Semi Gloss, Taubmans All Weather Enamel. Water-based enamels are now preferred over oil-based in Australia as they do not yellow over time and have lower VOCs. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every kitchen painting scope where trim is present. |
| **Safety/compliance** | If painting over previously oil-based (alkyd) enamel, must sand thoroughly and apply bonding primer before water-based top coat to ensure adhesion. Test existing paint -- rub with methylated spirits; if paint softens, it is water-based. If it does not, it is oil-based and needs appropriate prep. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Back edge of architraves (visible from the side when door is open). Top edge of skirting board. Gaps between architrave and wall -- these need caulking before painting, not just filling. Door stop moulding (the thin strip the door closes against). Paint colour of trim vs wall -- confirm with client whether trim is white, matched, or contrasting. |

---

### A4. Kitchen Window Frames and Sills

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting internal window frames, reveals/jambs, and sills in the kitchen. Window sills in kitchens are subject to moisture, condensation, and objects being placed on them, requiring a durable finish. |
| **Typical method** | Sand existing paint with 180-220 grit. Clean with sugar soap. Fill any cracks or gaps with flexible acrylic caulk. Apply enamel with a 38-50mm brush, working from the innermost sections outward. Sills require careful, thin coats to avoid drips and runs. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted** | Sand, spot-prime, 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system -- New timber** | 1 coat primer/undercoat (Dulux 1 Step Prep or equivalent) + 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss or gloss. Sills benefit from higher sheen for durability and moisture resistance. Semi-gloss is preferred for its balance of durability and appearance. |
| **Recommended product class** | Water-based enamel. Examples: Dulux Aquanamel Semi Gloss, Resene Lustacryl. For high-wear sills, gloss finish provides maximum durability. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only included if kitchen has windows with paintable frames. Aluminium window frames are not painted. Timber and pre-primed timber frames are included. |
| **Safety/compliance** | If window frames are pre-1970 timber with multiple layers of old paint, test for lead paint before sanding. Older window putty may contain asbestos -- do not sand or remove without testing. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Window reveals (the internal sides of the window opening) -- these are often missed or done poorly. Underside of the sill. Putty line along glass (if traditional timber windows). Whether aluminium frames are being painted or left as-is -- clarify in scope. External side of window frame -- specify if interior only or both sides. |

---

### A5. Kitchen Feature/Accent Wall

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Application of a contrasting or darker paint colour to a single wall (or portion of a wall) as a design feature. Common behind open shelving, at a breakfast bar, or as a statement wall visible from living areas in open-plan layouts. |
| **Typical method** | Same preparation as standard walls. Mask edges precisely using quality painter's tape (e.g. Frog Tape or 3M Blue) to achieve a clean colour-break line. Apply primer/sealer if colour is significantly different from existing. Apply top coats, removing tape while final coat is still slightly tacky for cleanest edge. |
| **Coating system** | If going from light to dark: 1 coat tinted primer/sealer + 2 coats coloured top coat. If going from dark to light: 2 coats stain-blocking primer/sealer + 2 coats top coat (may need up to 4 total coats). If going from light to medium: 2 coats top coat typically sufficient. |
| **Recommended product class** | Same kitchen-grade washable acrylic as other walls (Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom or equivalent). For very dark or saturated colours, Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Super Hide Low Sheen provides better coverage in fewer coats. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when client specifies a feature wall. Must be explicitly scoped including colour, location, and extent. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Dark and ultra-deep colours require Level 5 plasterboard finish per AS/NZS 2311 for gloss paints or dark colours, as imperfections are accentuated. On existing walls, ensure surface is flat and free of imperfections before applying dark colours. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Additional coats required for dramatic colour changes (scope should state "to full coverage" not just "2 coats"). Cost of tinted primer for dark colours. Return edges where accent wall meets adjacent walls -- specify where colour change occurs. Power point and switch plates on accent wall may need to be changed to match or contrast. Light fixtures on accent wall may highlight wall imperfections -- assess condition before committing to dark colour. |

---

### A6. Kitchen Paint Grade Summary

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Specification of the overall paint grade/quality tier for the kitchen. Kitchens require washable/scrubbable paint due to cooking grease, moisture, and frequent cleaning. |
| **Minimum recommended grade** | Kitchen & bathroom specific formulation with mould inhibitor and scrubbable surface. Standard builder-grade flat paint is NOT acceptable for kitchen walls. |
| **Product tier examples** | **Premium:** Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom (Low Sheen or Semi Gloss), Haymes Expressions Kitchen & Bathroom. **Mid-range:** Taubmans Easy Living Kitchen & Bathroom. **Economy (not recommended):** Generic ceiling/wall flat -- lacks mould resistance, not scrubbable, not suitable for kitchens. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- paint grade must be specified in every kitchen painting scope. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Specifying paint grade in the scope document. Many quotes just say "2 coats paint" without specifying product class, leading to disputes. Scope should nominate product class (e.g. "kitchen & bathroom grade acrylic, low sheen") and allow the painter to choose their preferred brand within that class. |

---

## B. Bathroom

### B1. Bathroom Walls (Above Tile Line)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting wall surfaces above the tiled areas in the bathroom. In most Australian bathrooms, tiles extend to approximately 1800mm on shower walls and 900-1200mm on other walls (splashback height above vanity and bath). The painted surface above the tile line is subject to high humidity, steam, and occasional water spray. |
| **Typical method** | Clean walls with sugar soap and anti-mould solution. Treat any existing mould with a mould-killing solution (e.g. 1:4 bleach/water mix) and allow to dry completely before painting. Lightly sand. Mask tile line precisely. Apply paint with brush (cutting in) and roller. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted** | Spot-prime bare patches, then 2 coats bathroom-grade acrylic. If mould staining is present, apply 1 coat stain-blocking primer (e.g. Zinsser Mould Stop) before top coats. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat acrylic primer/sealer + 2 coats bathroom-grade acrylic. 3 coats minimum. Moisture-resistant plasterboard (green board) must be used in wet areas per NCC/BCA requirements. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss or low sheen. Semi-gloss is traditionally preferred in bathrooms for its superior moisture resistance, ease of cleaning, and mould resistance. Low sheen is increasingly popular for a more contemporary look and still performs well in bathroom-grade formulations. |
| **Recommended product class** | Bathroom-specific acrylic with anti-mould/mildew additives. Examples: Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom (Semi Gloss or Low Sheen), Zinsser PermaWhite (mould-resistant), Resene Zylone Sheen Ceiling Paint (for bathroom ceilings). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every bathroom painting scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Do not paint in the waterproofing zone (behind tiles in shower recess, to minimum 1800mm, and 150mm on other wet area walls per AS 3740). Painting is the *finish* above the tile line, not a waterproofing treatment. Ensure adequate ventilation -- open windows or run exhaust fan during and after painting. Do not expose freshly painted surfaces to steam for minimum 48 hours after application. Allow 7 days full cure. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Wall area directly above the shower screen (gets very wet from steam and spray -- most critical area for mould-resistant paint). Wall behind the toilet cistern. Narrow wall strips between tile and ceiling (often awkward, sometimes missed). Mould treatment before painting -- painting over mould without treatment means it will return. The junction between tile and paint -- specify whether a bead of caulk or a clean paint line is expected. |

---

### B2. Bathroom Ceiling

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting the entire bathroom ceiling. Bathroom ceilings are the highest-risk surface for mould growth due to rising steam condensing on the coolest surface. Mould-resistant paint is essential. |
| **Typical method** | Treat any existing mould with mould-killing solution and allow to dry completely. Sand lightly. Apply paint with roller (10mm nap) working in consistent passes. Cut in at perimeter and around exhaust fan, light fittings, and any skylights. |
| **Coating system -- Existing** | Treat mould, spot-prime, 2 coats bathroom-grade ceiling paint. If existing ceiling is heavily stained or mouldy, apply 1 full coat stain-blocking primer (shellac-based such as Zinsser B-I-N is most effective against mould stains) before 2 top coats. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat acrylic primer/sealer + 2 coats mould-resistant ceiling paint. 3 coats minimum. |
| **Recommended finish** | Flat/matt with anti-mould additives. Flat finish is standard for ceilings. Must contain active mould inhibitor. |
| **Recommended product class** | Bathroom-specific ceiling paint. Examples: Dulux Ceiling White +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom, Zinsser PermaWhite Ceiling Paint. Standard ceiling paint without mould inhibitor is NOT suitable for bathrooms. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every bathroom painting scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Working at height in a confined space -- ensure stable platform. Electrical safety around bathroom light fittings and exhaust fans. If exhaust fan is removed for painting, an electrician must isolate and reconnect. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Mould treatment before repainting (critical -- mould will bleed through standard paint). Exhaust fan surround and any gap between fan housing and ceiling. Access hatch (if present in bathroom ceiling) -- specify whether both sides are painted. Existing ceiling paint type -- if it is oil-based (common in older homes), a bonding primer is required before applying water-based paint. Bathroom ceilings in older homes may have textured coatings (stipple, popcorn) that need assessment -- cannot just roller over heavily textured surfaces without addressing the texture first. |

---

### B3. Bathroom Vanity (If Painted)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting the bathroom vanity unit (cabinet doors, drawer fronts, side panels, and internal shelves if specified). This is a separate scope item from wall/ceiling painting and requires a different preparation and product approach, especially for melamine, laminate, or previously lacquered surfaces. |
| **Typical method** | Remove doors and drawers from cabinet. Remove all hardware (handles, hinges). Clean with sugar soap. Sand all surfaces with 120-150 grit to create a mechanical key. Wipe down with tack cloth. Apply specialty primer suitable for the substrate (melamine, laminate, or timber). Apply top coats by brush, mini-roller, or spray (spray gives best finish on cabinetry). Re-install hardware and rehang doors/drawers after full cure (minimum 5-7 days). |
| **Coating system -- Melamine/laminate** | 1 coat specialty bonding primer (e.g. Zinsser B-I-N Shellac Primer, Dulux Precision Maximum Strength Adhesion Primer, or White Knight Laminate Primer) + 2 coats water-based enamel or cabinet paint. Standard primers will NOT adhere to melamine. |
| **Coating system -- Timber/MDF (painted)** | Sand, spot-prime bare areas, 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system -- Timber/MDF (raw)** | 1 coat acrylic primer/undercoat + 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss or satin. Must be durable enough to withstand daily moisture, cleaning products, and contact. |
| **Recommended product class** | Cabinet-grade water-based enamel or dedicated cabinet paint. Examples: Dulux Aquanamel, Dulux Renovation Range Satin, Benjamin Moore ADVANCE (available in Australia). For melamine, Zinsser B-I-N shellac primer is the gold standard for adhesion. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only included when the bathroom renovation retains the existing vanity and client wants it repainted. If a new vanity is being installed, this item is excluded. Vanity painting is a cabinetry/joinery painting task, not a standard wall-painting task. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Shellac-based primers (B-I-N) are solvent-based with strong fumes -- use in well-ventilated area with P2 respirator. Allow adequate curing time before reinstalling doors in a humid bathroom environment. Do not use food-grade paint on bathroom vanity (not required -- food-grade is only for kitchen benchtops). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Interior of vanity cabinet (visible when doors open -- specify if included). Top edge of doors (visible when open). Underside of overhead mirror cabinet (if present). Drawer interiors and edges. Vanity kick panel/plinth. The cost difference between painting a laminate vanity (requires specialty primer) and a timber vanity (standard prep). Adequate curing time in a humid environment -- painter must advise client not to use bathroom for recommended period after painting vanity. |

---

### B4. Bathroom Trim

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting door architraves, skirting boards (where present above tile), window architraves, and any exposed mouldings in the bathroom. |
| **Typical method** | Same as kitchen trim (A3) -- sand, fill, prime bare patches, apply water-based enamel by brush. |
| **Coating system** | Same as kitchen trim. Existing painted: sand + 2 coats enamel. New timber/MDF: 1 coat primer + 2 coats enamel. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss. Provides durability and moisture resistance in the wet environment. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included when trim is present. Note that in many modern bathrooms, skirting boards are replaced by tile extending to the floor, so there may be no skirting to paint. Architraves around the door are always present. |
| **Safety/compliance** | As per kitchen trim. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | The bathroom door (see D4 for doors -- bathroom door is often included in the bathroom painting scope). Skirting board above the tile line only -- or is skirting replaced by tile? Clarify with client. Access panel frames for plumbing access. Shower screen frame (if painted aluminium -- specify whether included or excluded). |

---

### B5. Bathroom Coating Summary

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Coats in wet areas** | Per AS/NZS 2311: bare surfaces require minimum 3 coats (1 primer + 2 top coats). Existing sound surfaces require minimum 2 top coats. In practice, most painters apply 2-3 coats on bathroom walls and ceilings to achieve full coverage and performance. |
| **Key differences from dry areas** | Mould-resistant formulation is mandatory (standard wall paint will grow mould within 6-12 months in a bathroom). Semi-gloss or low sheen preferred over flat/matt for walls (moisture resistance and cleanability). Extended curing time required -- no steam exposure for 48 hours, full cure 7 days. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Specifying bathroom-grade paint in the scope (not just "2 coats acrylic"). Ensuring exhaust fan is operational before painting (inadequate ventilation accelerates mould growth regardless of paint quality). |

---

## C. Laundry

### C1. Laundry Walls

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting all wall surfaces in the laundry. Laundries are classified as wet areas and are subject to similar moisture conditions as bathrooms (steam from dryer, splashing from tub/sink, humidity from drying clothes). |
| **Typical method** | Same preparation as bathroom walls. Clean, treat any mould, sand, mask, and apply paint by brush and roller. |
| **Coating system -- Existing** | Spot-prime, then 2 coats kitchen & bathroom grade acrylic. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat primer/sealer + 2 coats kitchen & bathroom grade acrylic. 3 coats minimum. Moisture-resistant plasterboard required in laundry per NCC. |
| **Recommended finish** | Low sheen or semi-gloss. Same moisture considerations as bathroom. |
| **Recommended product class** | Kitchen & bathroom grade acrylic with mould inhibitor. Same product range as bathroom (Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom or equivalent). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every laundry painting scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Same as bathroom. Pre-1970 lead paint testing if sanding old surfaces. Adequate ventilation. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Wall behind washing machine and dryer (not accessible until appliances are moved -- must be included in scope and coordinated with appliance disconnection). Wall above laundry tub/sink splashback. If laundry tub has a tiled splashback, same tile-line masking approach as bathroom. Internal walls of laundry cupboard/linen press if built-in. |

---

### C2. Laundry Ceiling

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting the laundry ceiling. Subject to humidity from washing and drying, so mould-resistant paint is required, same as bathroom ceiling. |
| **Typical method** | Same as bathroom ceiling (B2). |
| **Coating system** | Same as bathroom ceiling. Existing: treat mould + 2 coats mould-resistant ceiling paint. New: 1 primer + 2 top coats. |
| **Recommended product class** | Bathroom/kitchen ceiling paint with mould inhibitor. Same products as bathroom ceiling. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every laundry painting scope. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Laundry ceilings are often an afterthought because the room is less "visible" than bathrooms -- but they experience similar moisture conditions. Exhaust fan surround. Ceiling area above the clothes dryer (particularly prone to mould if dryer is not externally vented). |

---

### C3. Laundry Trim

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting door architraves, skirting boards, and any window architraves/frames in the laundry. |
| **Typical method** | Same as kitchen and bathroom trim. Sand, fill, prime bare patches, apply water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system** | Same as bathroom trim (B4). |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss water-based enamel. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included when trim elements are present. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Laundry door (interior face often forgotten in scope). Trim around laundry cupboard doors (if built-in). External laundry door frame (if laundry has external access). |

---

## D. Living Areas / Bedrooms

### D1. Walls

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting all wall surfaces in living rooms, dining rooms, family rooms, bedrooms, hallways, and entry areas. These are dry areas and represent the largest painted surface area in most homes. |
| **Typical method** | Clean walls with sugar soap and rinse. Fill nail holes, cracks, and imperfections with lightweight filler. Sand filler smooth (220 grit). Sand existing painted walls lightly to provide a key. Mask adjacent surfaces (trim, ceiling line, windows). Cut in at edges with brush. Roll walls with 10-12mm nap roller in overlapping "W" pattern. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted (good condition)** | Light sand, spot-prime filler patches, 2 coats premium acrylic low sheen. No full primer required if existing paint is sound and compatible (same base type). |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted (poor condition)** | Scrape loose or flaking paint, sand, 1 full coat primer/sealer over entire surface, then 2 coats top coat. 3 coats total. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat acrylic primer/sealer (applied by roller with 10mm wool nap, or spray with mandatory back-roll per AS/NZS 2311) + 2 coats top coat. 3 coats minimum. Level 4 plasterboard finish is required as a minimum for painted walls; Level 5 for gloss paints or dark colours. |
| **Recommended finish** | Low sheen. This is the standard Australian residential finish for walls -- it hides minor imperfections, provides a contemporary look, and is washable. Matt is an option for a more luxurious look but is less washable. |
| **Recommended product class** | Premium washable acrylic. Examples: Dulux Wash&Wear Low Sheen, Taubmans Easy Living Low Sheen, Haymes Expressions Low Sheen. For high-traffic areas (hallways, entries), Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Tough Touch or equivalent for enhanced scuff resistance. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every living area/bedroom painting scope. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Lead paint testing on pre-1970 homes before sanding. Dust sheets over flooring and furniture. Adequate ventilation. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Walls inside built-in wardrobes (if robe is being painted internally). Walls behind radiators or heaters. Niche walls (recessed shelving, TV niches). Return walls at doorways. Hallway walls (high-traffic, often need more durable product). Stair void walls (require scaffolding -- significant cost addition). Walls above 2.4m height (require scaffolding or extension poles). Number of colours -- if each bedroom is a different colour, each colour change adds time and material cost. |

---

### D2. Ceilings

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting ceiling surfaces in living areas and bedrooms. Dry area ceilings are less demanding than wet area ceilings but still require proper preparation and product selection. |
| **Typical method** | Sand lightly if previously painted. Fill cracks, nail pops, or joint imperfections. Apply by roller (10-12mm nap) working in consistent directional passes to avoid lap marks. Cut in at perimeter. Work away from the primary light source to minimise visible roller marks. |
| **Coating system -- Existing** | Spot-prime repairs, 2 coats ceiling paint. |
| **Coating system -- New plasterboard** | 1 coat primer/sealer + 2 coats ceiling paint. |
| **Recommended finish** | Flat/matt. Flat is the universal standard for ceilings -- it minimises light reflection and hides roller texture. |
| **Recommended product class** | Dedicated ceiling paint. Examples: Dulux Ceiling White, Dulux Professional Ceiling Flat, Taubmans Ceiling Paint. Standard ceiling paint is acceptable for dry areas (does not need mould inhibitor unless the room has poor ventilation). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every painting scope for living areas. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Working at height. Protect floors and furniture. If ceiling has a textured finish (stipple, artex, popcorn), it may contain asbestos if applied pre-1990 -- test before sanding or scraping. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Ceiling in hallways and corridors (often forgotten in room-by-room quotes). Ceiling in stair voids (requires scaffolding -- significant cost). Ceiling colour -- confirm with client if it is standard white or tinted. Cornices -- specify whether cornice is painted ceiling colour or wall colour (this affects which trade paints it). Cathedral/raked ceilings in living areas -- these are larger surface areas and more difficult to access than flat ceilings. |

---

### D3. Trim, Architraves, and Skirting

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting all timber or MDF trim elements throughout living areas and bedrooms: door architraves (both sides of the doorway), skirting boards, window architraves, and any decorative mouldings (picture rails, dado rails, cornices if painted in enamel). |
| **Typical method** | Sand with 180-220 grit. Fill gaps between trim and wall with acrylic caulk (this is a painter's responsibility, not a carpenter's). Fill nail holes, dents, and imperfections with acrylic filler. Spot-prime filler patches with primer/undercoat. Apply enamel by brush (50-63mm angled sash brush for architraves, 75mm for skirting) or mini-roller. Sand lightly between coats with 220-320 grit for a smooth finish. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted** | Sand, caulk gaps, fill holes, spot-prime, 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system -- New timber/MDF** | 1 coat primer/undercoat + 2 coats water-based enamel. Pre-primed MDF still needs 1 additional site primer coat + 2 top coats. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss. Industry standard for trim in Australia. Provides durability, is easy to clean, and creates visual contrast with low-sheen walls. |
| **Recommended product class** | Water-based enamel (non-yellowing). Examples: Dulux Aquanamel Semi Gloss, Resene Lustacryl Semi Gloss, Taubmans All Weather Semi Gloss Enamel. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in every living area painting scope. Skirting, architraves, and trim are a significant portion of the painting scope (can be 25-35% of the total cost). |
| **Safety/compliance** | If existing trim was previously painted with oil-based enamel (common in pre-2000 homes), thorough sanding and bonding primer are required before applying water-based topcoat. Oil-based enamel yellows over time, so homes being repainted often switch from oil-based to water-based enamel -- but the preparation must be correct for adhesion. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Caulking gaps between trim and walls (a critical step that painters sometimes skip but which dramatically affects finish quality). Back edges of architraves. Top edge of skirting. Door stop mouldings. Picture rails and dado rails (if present in older homes). Skirting board returns (the small mitred end pieces at doorways). Skirting behind furniture (should be painted even if furniture will cover it). Linear metres of trim -- underestimating the total length of skirting and architraves is the most common quoting error for painting. |

### D4. Doors (Both Sides and Edges)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting internal doors including both faces, all four edges (top, bottom, hinge edge, latch edge), and the door frame/jamb if included in scope. Panel doors have significantly more surface area and detail than flush doors. |
| **Typical method** | Remove door from hinges and lay flat on sawhorses (preferred for best finish -- eliminates drips). Remove all hardware (handles, hinges, latches). Sand all surfaces with 180 grit. Fill any dents, holes, or imperfections. Prime bare timber or filler patches. Apply enamel by brush (for panel doors, paint panels first, then stiles, then rails) or mini-roller for flush doors. Apply thin, even coats to avoid drips, especially on edges. Allow to dry fully, sand lightly between coats (220 grit). Reinstall hardware and rehang after full cure. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted** | Sand, spot-prime, 2 coats water-based enamel (both faces + all edges). |
| **Coating system -- New timber/MDF** | 1 coat primer/undercoat + 2 coats water-based enamel. All six surfaces (both faces + 4 edges). |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss or satin. Semi-gloss is traditional; satin is increasingly popular for a more contemporary look while still being durable and wipeable. |
| **Recommended product class** | Water-based enamel (same as trim). Examples: Dulux Aquanamel, Dulux Doors Windows & Trim range, Resene Lustacryl. |
| **Both sides scope rule** | A door has two faces and four edges. The scope must explicitly state whether both faces are included. Standard practice: if a door separates two rooms being painted, both faces are included. If only one room is being painted, scope the face within that room plus the latch edge (visible from that room when door is closed). The hinge edge faces the other room. The top and bottom edges should always be primed/sealed to prevent moisture ingress (even if not top-coated). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- doors are included in every room painting scope. But the number of doors and whether both faces are included must be explicit. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Do not overload edges with paint -- heavy paint buildup causes doors to stick in frames. Bottom edge: lightly prime/seal only, do not apply full topcoat (door may not clear carpet/floor). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Bottom edge of door (needs at minimum a seal coat to prevent moisture swelling). Top edge of door (visible from staircase landings or mezzanines). Hinge edge (often forgotten when door is painted on the wall). Door frame/jamb (the rebate the door sits into) -- specify whether included or excluded. Cost of door removal and rehang (time-consuming, especially for older doors with paint-clogged hinges). Number of doors -- a typical 3-bedroom house has 12-15 internal doors. Panel doors take approximately twice as long as flush doors. |

### D5. Window Frames (Interior)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting internal window frames, reveals (sides of the window opening), sills, and any window-related trim in living areas and bedrooms. |
| **Typical method** | Sand, clean, fill cracks and gaps. Apply enamel by brush, working from innermost sections outward. Sills must be done with thin, even coats to prevent runs. Mask glass panes (or use a steady hand and scrape overspill from glass with a razor blade after drying). |
| **Coating system** | Same as trim (D3). Existing: sand + 2 coats enamel. New: 1 primer + 2 coats enamel. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss water-based enamel. Sills in particular benefit from semi-gloss for durability and cleanability. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only for timber or MDF window frames. Aluminium or PVC frames are not painted as part of a standard painting scope. Clarify frame material with client. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Multiple layers of old paint on window frames in pre-1970 homes are a high risk for lead paint. Window putty may contain asbestos. Test before sanding. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Window reveals (the sides of the window opening between the frame and the wall) -- these are frequently missed and often in poor condition. Sill underside. Window lock hardware (remove before painting or mask carefully). Sash cords and pulleys in older double-hung windows (do not paint over -- they need to remain functional). External window frame -- specify if scope is interior only or both sides. |

---

### D6. Built-in Wardrobes (If Painted)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting the visible external surfaces of built-in wardrobes: doors, drawer fronts, side panels (if exposed), and top panel (if visible). Internal painting of wardrobe is optional and separate. Built-in wardrobes may be timber, MDF, or melamine/laminate, each requiring different preparation. |
| **Typical method** | Similar to vanity painting (B3). Remove doors and drawers. Remove hardware. Clean and sand. Apply appropriate primer for the substrate. Top coat with enamel. Reinstall after cure. |
| **Coating system -- Timber/MDF** | 1 coat primer/undercoat + 2 coats water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system -- Melamine/laminate** | 1 coat specialty bonding primer (Zinsser B-I-N, Dulux Precision Adhesion Primer, or White Knight Laminate Primer) + 2 coats water-based enamel. Standard primer will not adhere to melamine surfaces. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss or satin. Must be durable for daily handle contact and cleaning. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when existing wardrobes are being retained and refreshed. Specify surfaces included (door faces, edges, internals). |
| **Safety/compliance** | Shellac-based primers require good ventilation. Allow extended curing time (5-7 days minimum) before reattaching doors and using the wardrobe -- paint needs to be fully cured to resist scuffing from clothes hangers and stored items. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Internal surfaces of the wardrobe (shelves, rails, back panel) -- specify whether included. Top of wardrobe (if not ceiling-height -- visible dust trap). Door edges. Shelf edges. The substantial time difference between painting melamine (requires specialty primer and extra preparation) versus timber (standard prep). Curing time advisory to the client. |

---

### D7. Feature Walls

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Application of a contrasting colour to a single wall or portion of a wall in a living area or bedroom. Very common in bedrooms (typically the bedhead wall) and living rooms (media wall or fireplace wall). |
| **Typical method** | Same as kitchen feature wall (A5). Precise masking at colour-change lines. May require tinted primer for dramatic colour changes. |
| **Coating system** | Light to dark: tinted primer + 2 top coats. Dark to light: stain-blocking primer + 2 top coats (may need additional coats). Same colour family: 2 top coats. |
| **Recommended product class** | Same as room walls (Dulux Wash&Wear Low Sheen or equivalent). For dark/saturated colours, Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Super Hide for better coverage. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when specified by client. Must include colour, wall location, and extent (full wall or partial). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Same as kitchen feature wall (A5). Return edges where colour change occurs. Power point and switch plate alignment with feature colour. Additional coats for dark or vibrant colours (red, deep blue, charcoal) -- can require 3-4 top coats even with tinted primer. |

## E. Outdoor / Exterior (If Applicable)

### E1. Weatherboard Painting

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting exterior weatherboard cladding. Preparation is the primary scope item for weatherboard painting and typically represents 60-70% of the total labour. Weatherboards may be timber (hardwood or softwood), fibre cement (Hardiplank), or reconstituted timber (Weathertex). Each has slightly different preparation requirements. |
| **Typical method -- Preparation (the main scope)** | (1) Pressure wash entire surface to remove dirt, dust, cobwebs, mould, and loose paint. Add mould killer to wash water. (2) Allow to dry completely (minimum 24-48 hours). (3) Scrape all loose, flaking, or peeling paint using paint scraper and/or electric heat gun. (4) Sand all surfaces: coarse grit (60-80) for heavy paint removal, medium grit (100-120) to smooth, fine grit (220+) for final smooth finish between coats. (5) Fill cracks, gaps, and nail holes with exterior-grade flexible filler (UV-resistant, paintable). (6) Caulk gaps between boards and at junctions with window/door frames using exterior-grade polyurethane or acrylic caulk. (7) Spot-prime all bare timber, filler, and caulk with exterior primer. |
| **Typical method -- Painting** | Apply by brush (for cut-in at edges, under laps, around windows/doors) and roller or spray with back-roll for board faces. Work from top to bottom, maintaining a wet edge. Paint each board along its full length without stopping to avoid lap marks. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted (good condition)** | Wash, sand, spot-prime bare areas, 2 coats exterior acrylic. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted (poor condition)** | Full preparation (scrape, sand, fill, caulk), 1 full coat exterior primer/sealer, 2 coats exterior acrylic. 3 coats minimum. |
| **Coating system -- New or bare timber** | 1 coat exterior primer/sealer + 2 coats exterior acrylic. All edges (including back of boards) should ideally be primed before installation. |
| **Recommended finish** | Low sheen or semi-gloss. Low sheen is most common for weatherboard bodies. Semi-gloss for a more traditional look or for improved dirt-shedding. |
| **Recommended product class** | Premium exterior acrylic (UV-resistant, flexible, breathable). Examples: Dulux Weathershield Low Sheen, Dulux Weathershield Max, Taubmans All Weather Exterior, Haymes Solashield. Modern acrylics are preferred over oil-based for exterior use in Australia -- they flex with temperature changes, resist cracking, and allow moisture vapour to escape. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when scope includes exterior painting. Exterior weatherboard is the most labour-intensive painting scope item due to preparation. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Working at height -- scaffolding is typically required for two-storey homes (scaffold hire is a significant cost item). Lead paint is common on pre-1970 exteriors -- test before sanding or scraping. If lead detected, wet methods required, P2 respirator, containment of debris per AS 4361.2. Weather conditions: do not paint below 10 degrees C or above 35 degrees C, or when rain is expected within 24 hours, or in direct strong sunlight. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | The preparation labour (scraping, sanding, filling, caulking) -- this is the majority of the work and cost, not the painting itself. Under-laps of weatherboards (the hidden overlap area can harbour moisture if not addressed). Window and door frames (often a different colour/product from the body -- see E4). Scaffold hire cost ($1,500-$5,000+ for a two-storey house). Condition-based scope -- preparation effort varies dramatically between a house with sound paint vs one with severe peeling. Protection of gardens, paths, driveways from paint drips and pressure washing debris. |

---

### E2. Render Painting

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting cement-rendered, acrylic-rendered, or textured exterior walls. Rendered walls have different preparation requirements from weatherboard. New render must cure before painting. |
| **Typical method -- Preparation** | (1) Assess render condition -- check for cracks, hollow areas (delamination), and efflorescence (white salt deposits). (2) Pressure wash to remove dirt, mould, and loose material. (3) Allow to dry completely. (4) Fill cracks with exterior render patch or flexible filler. (5) Treat efflorescence with acid wash or proprietary treatment. (6) If large areas of render are damaged, engage a renderer for repairs before painting. |
| **Curing requirement for new render** | New cement render must cure for minimum 4-6 weeks before painting. Painting over uncured render traps moisture and causes bubbling, cracking, or delamination. |
| **Coating system -- Existing painted render** | Wash, repair cracks, 2 coats exterior acrylic masonry paint. |
| **Coating system -- New/bare render** | 1 coat masonry primer/sealer (slightly diluted first coat aids absorption on porous new render) + 2 coats exterior acrylic masonry paint. |
| **Recommended finish** | Low sheen or matt. Textured render surfaces often look best in low sheen or matt finishes. |
| **Recommended product class** | Exterior masonry/acrylic paint (breathable, flexible). Examples: Dulux Weathershield, Dulux AcraTex. The paint must be breathable to allow moisture vapour to escape from within the render. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when scope includes exterior render painting. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Same height/weather considerations as weatherboard. Do not seal render with a non-breathable coating (e.g. oil-based paint) as trapped moisture will cause render failure. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | New render curing time -- if render has just been applied as part of the renovation, painting must wait 4-6 weeks. This affects project scheduling significantly. Render repairs (cracked or hollow render) must be done before painting -- this is a renderer's task, not a painter's. Efflorescence treatment. Texture variation -- flat render and textured render require different amounts of paint (textured uses 20-40% more). |

---

### E3. Eaves and Fascia

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting the underside of the roof overhang (eaves/soffits) and the vertical fascia board where the gutter attaches. Eaves and fascia are typically painted a contrasting colour (white or light) to the body colour. They are exposed to weather but sheltered from direct sun (eaves) and subject to gutter overflow and moisture (fascia). |
| **Typical method** | Clean with sugar soap or pressure wash (low pressure for eaves). Sand any peeling areas. Scrape loose paint. Fill imperfections. Apply by brush (fascia -- work along the length) and roller (eaves -- long-nap roller for fibrous cement sheet). Spray is efficient for large eave areas but requires extensive masking. |
| **Coating system** | Existing: sand, spot-prime, 2 coats exterior acrylic (semi-gloss). New/bare: 1 coat exterior primer + 2 coats exterior acrylic semi-gloss. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss. Eaves and fascia are traditionally semi-gloss in Australia (contrasts with low-sheen body). Semi-gloss resists dirt accumulation and moisture. |
| **Recommended product class** | Exterior acrylic semi-gloss. Examples: Dulux Weathershield Semi Gloss, Taubmans All Weather Semi Gloss. For areas prone to moisture, elastomeric coatings provide additional protection against cracking. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in any exterior painting scope. Eaves and fascia are always included when the exterior is being painted. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Working at height (scaffolding or extension ladder). Wasp/bee nests in eaves are common -- check before starting. Asbestos eave lining (fibrous cement) common in pre-1990 homes -- do not sand or scrape without testing. If asbestos confirmed, seal (encapsulate) rather than sand, or engage licensed removalist. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Bargeboards (the angled fascia boards on gable ends). Gutter back (the rear face of the gutter visible when looking up at the eaves -- painters often skip this). Downpipe painting (specify if included). Eave vents/grilles (specify if painted or left). Number of coats on fascia boards in poor condition (may need 3 coats due to sun/weather damage). Asbestos testing for fibrous cement eave sheets. |

---

### E4. Exterior Window Frames, Front Door

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting exterior-facing window frames, sills, and the front (and/or rear) door. These are typically painted in a different finish (semi-gloss or gloss enamel) to the body colour, and the front door may be a feature colour. |
| **Typical method** | Sand, scrape loose paint, fill gaps and cracks with exterior-grade filler. Mask glass. Apply enamel by brush (window frames require careful cutting-in along glass line). Front door: remove hardware, sand, prime bare areas, apply enamel. If door has glass panels, mask glass before painting. |
| **Coating system -- Existing** | Sand, spot-prime, 2 coats exterior water-based enamel. |
| **Coating system -- New timber** | 1 coat exterior primer/undercoat + 2 coats exterior enamel. All edges (including top and bottom of door) must be sealed. |
| **Front door feature colour** | If a bold feature colour, may need tinted primer + 2-3 top coats. |
| **Recommended finish** | Semi-gloss or gloss. Gloss is traditional for front doors for a high-impact look. Semi-gloss for window frames. |
| **Recommended product class** | Exterior water-based enamel (non-yellowing, UV-resistant). Examples: Dulux Weathershield Exterior Enamel, Dulux Aquanamel (also suitable for exterior timber), Resene Enamacryl. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- included in any exterior painting scope. Front door feature colour is conditional on client specification. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Lead paint highly likely on pre-1970 exterior window frames and doors -- test before sanding. Working at height for upper-storey windows. Weather conditions as per weatherboard (E1). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Door threshold/sill (the bottom of the door frame at floor level -- high wear area). Door frame jamb (the rebate visible when door is open). Security screen door frame (specify if included). Fly screen frames. Window putty lines (traditional timber windows) -- loose putty should be replaced before painting. Number of opening windows vs fixed panes (opening windows have more edges to paint). |

---

### E5. Fence and Gate

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting or staining exterior fences and gates. Fences may be timber (paling, picket, or feature), Colorbond steel, or rendered masonry. Each requires different products and preparation. |
| **Typical method -- Timber** | Pressure wash. Allow to dry. Sand loose or flaking paint. Fill holes and cracks with exterior filler. Prime bare timber. Apply 2 coats exterior acrylic or stain. Spray application is most efficient for timber fences (especially paling fences with many small surfaces). |
| **Typical method -- Colorbond** | Wash with sugar soap. Lightly sand with 180-220 grit to create a key. Remove any rust with wire brush and apply rust converter. Apply 3 coats exterior water-based acrylic paint (per BlueScope Steel recommendation). Spray application provides the most even finish on Colorbond. |
| **Typical method -- Rendered masonry** | Same as exterior render (E2). Repair cracks, prime, 2 coats exterior masonry paint. |
| **Recommended product class** | Timber: Exterior acrylic (e.g. Dulux Weathershield) or exterior timber stain (e.g. Cabot's Deck & Exterior Stain). Colorbond: Water-based exterior acrylic per BlueScope's recommendation. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when scope includes fence/gate painting. Often excluded from interior renovation scopes unless specifically requested. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Boundary fences may require neighbour agreement before painting (dividing fence legislation varies by state). Overspray risk from spraying fences -- mask and protect adjacent properties, gardens, and paths. Timber fence posts may be treated pine -- ensure paint/stain is compatible with CCA or ACQ treated timber. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Both sides of the fence (if client owns both sides -- e.g. within their property boundary). Gate hardware removal before painting. Posts and rails (not just palings). Number of coats on Colorbond (manufacturer requires 3 coats). Neighbour notification if painting a shared boundary fence. Fence capping/coping on top. Amount of linear metres -- fences are a large surface area and often underquoted. |

---

### E6. Deck (Stain/Oil)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Applying oil or stain to timber decking. Decking is NOT painted with acrylic paint -- it requires a penetrating oil or stain that soaks into the timber rather than forming a film on the surface. Film-forming paints on decking peel and flake under foot traffic and weather exposure. |
| **Typical method -- Preparation** | (1) Clean deck with deck-specific cleaner (e.g. Cabot's Deck Clean) to remove dirt, mould, tannin stains, and grey weathering. (2) For new timber: clean with deck prep product to remove mill glaze and surface oils (this replaces the traditional 4-6 week weathering wait). (3) For previously oiled/stained decks: clean and strip old coating if peeling or flaking. (4) Allow timber to dry completely -- test by sprinkling water on surface; if it beads, timber is not ready; if it absorbs, timber is ready. (5) Sand only if necessary (remove splinters, smooth rough areas). |
| **Typical method -- Application** | Apply oil/stain by brush, roller (short-nap), or lamb's wool applicator. Work along the length of each board. Maintain a wet edge. Apply thin, even coats. For oils, 1-2 coats is typical (some penetrating oils are single-coat). For stains, 2 coats for desired colour depth. Back-brush to work product into the timber grain. |
| **Coating system -- New timber** | Clean with deck prep product + 1-2 coats penetrating oil or stain. |
| **Coating system -- Previously coated** | Strip or clean old coating + 1-2 coats fresh oil or stain. |
| **Recommended product class** | Penetrating decking oil or stain (not film-forming paint). Examples: Cabot's Deck & Exterior Stain (Oil Based), Intergrain UltraDeck, Sikkens Cetol HLSe, Dulux Intergrain Natural Timber Oil. Product choice depends on desired look (natural, tinted, or opaque) and timber species. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when scope includes deck finishing. Deck oiling/staining is a separate trade task from wall painting and may be done by the same painter or a specialist. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Slip resistance -- freshly oiled decks can be slippery until fully absorbed. Ventilation for oil-based products. Application temperature: 10-35 degrees C. Do not apply if rain expected within the drying period (varies by product, typically 24-48 hours). Do not apply in direct strong sunlight (causes too-rapid drying and uneven absorption). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Deck stairs and risers (same product as deck boards). Handrail and balustrade (may be painted enamel or oiled timber -- clarify which). Underside of deck boards (ideally primed/sealed to prevent moisture ingress from below, but rarely done in practice). Deck fascia boards (the vertical trim around the deck perimeter). Re-oiling/re-staining is maintenance, not a one-time treatment -- decks typically need re-oiling every 1-3 years depending on exposure. End-grain sealing (cut ends of boards absorb more moisture and need extra product). |

---

## F. New Surfaces (Renovation-Specific)

### F1. New Plasterboard -- Full Coating System

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Applying a complete coating system to newly installed plasterboard (the most common substrate in Australian renovations). New plasterboard is highly absorbent and requires a full primer coat before top-coating. This is the baseline specification for all new wall and ceiling surfaces. |
| **Mandatory coating system per AS/NZS 2311** | **Minimum 3 coats: 1 primer/sealer + 2 top coats.** This is non-negotiable per the Australian Standard and Master Painters Association guidelines. |
| **Primer/sealer coat** | Apply 1 coat of acrylic plasterboard primer/sealer (e.g. Dulux Precision Plasterboard Primer, Dulux 1 Step Prep, Taubmans 3-in-1 Primer Sealer Undercoat). This coat seals the absorbent paper face of the plasterboard and provides a uniform base for top coats. |
| **Application method for primer** | Roller (10mm wool nap) is the preferred method per AS/NZS 2311 for the first coat on plasterboard. If spray-applied, the first coat MUST be back-rolled while still wet (mandatory requirement per AS/NZS 2311 to ensure uniform sealing). The final coat should also be back-rolled if sprayed. |
| **Top coats** | 2 coats of the selected top coat product (acrylic for walls/ceilings, enamel for trim). Each coat must be allowed to dry per manufacturer's recoat time (typically 2-4 hours for acrylic) before the next coat. |
| **Plasterboard finish level** | Level 4 is the minimum standard for painted walls and ceilings in Australia. Level 5 (full skim coat over entire surface) is required for gloss paints, dark colours, or surfaces receiving strong side-lighting (e.g. hallway walls with recessed downlights). If the plasterboard finish is only Level 3 (standard for wet areas behind tile), it is NOT suitable for a painted finish -- joints and fixings will be visible through paint. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- applies to ALL new plasterboard surfaces in a renovation. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Plasterboard dust from sanding joints is a respiratory hazard -- P2 mask required. Ensure plasterboard is fully dry and all joints/compounds are cured before priming (typically 24-48 hours after final compound coat). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | The primer coat is often skipped or substituted with a "mist coat" (diluted top coat) -- this does NOT meet AS/NZS 2311 and results in poor finish, uneven sheen, and visible joint lines ("banding" or "flashing"). Back-rolling requirement when spraying. Plasterboard finish level -- painters are not responsible for plasterboard finish quality, but a poor Level 3 finish will show through even the best paint job. Level 5 should be specified for critical areas (living room feature walls, hallways with downlights). Inside of cupboards and robes (new plasterboard that still needs painting). Bulkhead and soffit faces. |

---

### F2. Patched/Repaired Surfaces

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting over surfaces that have been patched, repaired, or had localised plasterboard replacement during the renovation. Common areas include: where walls were opened for plumbing/electrical, where wall niches were filled in, where damage from demolition was repaired, and where old fixtures left holes or marks. |
| **Typical method** | Ensure patch compound is fully cured and sanded smooth. Feather edges of patch to blend with surrounding surface. Spot-prime the patch and a margin around it (approximately 100-150mm beyond the patch edge) with acrylic primer/sealer. Allow to dry. Apply top coats over the full wall surface -- do not try to "spot paint" only the patch, as the sheen and colour will not match. |
| **Coating system** | 1 coat spot primer on patch + 2 full coats top coat on entire wall. Spot-painting patches only (without rolling the full wall) will result in visible "picture framing" around the repair. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- virtually every renovation involves some wall patching. The painting scope must account for full wall repainting, not just touch-up of patches. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Ensure patch compound is compatible with paint system. Some rapid-set compounds are not paintable without primer. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | The requirement to paint the FULL wall (not just the patch) to achieve a uniform finish. Ceiling patches require the full ceiling to be repainted. Multiple patches on the same wall still only require one full wall repaint. Patches over old wallpaper adhesive residue -- residue must be fully removed or sealed before painting, otherwise it will cause paint to peel. Patches at different heights from scaffolding vs ground level -- ensure consistent finish. |

---

### F3. New Timber (Architraves, Skirting, Doors)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Applying a complete coating system to newly installed timber or MDF joinery including architraves, skirting boards, window sills, door frames, and doors. New timber is absorbent and requires priming. Pre-primed profiles (common from Australian timber suppliers like Intrim Mouldings) still require additional site priming. |
| **Mandatory coating system** | **Minimum 3 coats: 1 primer/undercoat + 2 top coats enamel.** Per AS/NZS 2311 -- three coats on any bare timber surface. |
| **Primer/undercoat** | For new timber: oil-based primer/undercoat provides the best adhesion and sealing (e.g. Dulux Professional Total Prep Sealer Undercoat, Dulux 1 Step Prep). Water-based acrylic primer is also acceptable. For pre-primed MDF profiles: 1 additional coat of primer/undercoat on site after installation (the factory primer is a base coat only and is not sufficient as the sole primer -- nail holes, mitres, and cut ends all need priming). |
| **Top coats** | 2 coats water-based enamel (semi-gloss or satin). Sand lightly between coats (220-320 grit) for optimal finish. |
| **Application method** | Brush is standard for trim elements. Spray application gives the best finish on doors (followed by light back-rolling or tipping off). Mini-roller works well on flat skirting faces. |
| **Recommended product class** | Water-based enamel (non-yellowing). Examples: Dulux Aquanamel Semi Gloss, Resene Lustacryl. Water-based enamel is now the industry standard in Australia -- it does not yellow over time (unlike oil-based), has lower VOCs, and is easier to clean up. Oil-based enamel is still acceptable but is increasingly uncommon due to yellowing and environmental concerns. |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Standard** -- applies to ALL new timber/MDF joinery installed during the renovation. |
| **Safety/compliance** | New timber must be clean and dry. MDF dust is a respiratory hazard -- P2 mask required when sanding. Ensure all nail holes are filled and sanded before priming (painter's responsibility). Caulk all gaps between trim and walls/floors before painting (also painter's responsibility). |
| **Commonly forgotten** | Pre-primed MDF still needs an additional site primer coat (the factory prime is not the final primer). Cut ends and mitre joints on pre-primed profiles are bare -- they need priming on site. Back edges of architraves and skirting boards. Top edge of skirting (paint it -- dust collects and discolours bare timber). Bottom edge of doors (prime/seal at minimum). End grain on timber absorbs more product -- additional primer may be needed on cut ends. |

---

### F4. Previously Wallpapered Surfaces

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Preparing and painting wall surfaces where wallpaper has been removed as part of the renovation. Wallpaper removal frequently damages the plasterboard paper face, and adhesive residue must be fully addressed before painting. This is one of the most preparation-intensive painting tasks. |
| **Typical method -- Wallpaper removal (if not already done)** | (1) Score wallpaper surface with a scoring tool (creates perforations for steam/water to penetrate). (2) Apply wallpaper remover solution or use a wallpaper steamer to soften adhesive. (3) Scrape off wallpaper with a broad scraper. (4) Wash walls with warm water and vinegar solution (1:1 ratio) to dissolve remaining adhesive residue. (5) Allow to dry completely. |
| **Typical method -- Surface preparation after removal** | (1) Scrape any remaining adhesive residue. (2) Assess plasterboard damage -- the paper face is often torn or delaminated in patches. (3) Apply a stabilising/sealing primer to the entire surface (e.g. Zinsser Gardz Problem Surface Sealer or Dulux 1 Step Prep). This seals damaged paper fibres and adhesive residue. (4) Fill all damaged areas, torn paper spots, and imperfections with joint compound. (5) Sand smooth. (6) Apply second coat of primer/sealer if damage was extensive. |
| **Coating system** | 1 coat stabilising primer/sealer over entire surface + fill and sand + 1 additional coat primer/sealer over filler + 2 coats top coat. In severe cases this can be a 4-5 coat system. Alternatively, if plasterboard is too damaged, skim-coat the entire surface (plasterer's task) and then paint as new plasterboard (F1). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when the renovation involves wallpaper removal. This must be explicitly scoped because the preparation labour is substantial. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Wallpaper adhesive in older homes (pre-1980) may contain formaldehyde or other irritants -- wear gloves and ensure ventilation. If wallpaper was applied over lead-painted walls, the lead paint is now exposed -- test and follow lead paint protocols per AS 4361.2. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | The significant additional preparation labour (wallpaper removal and wall repair can take as long as the actual painting). Adhesive residue that causes paint to peel if not fully removed or sealed. Damage to plasterboard paper face during removal (very common -- almost unavoidable with steamer or scraper). The option to skim-coat walls (plasterer's task) as an alternative to extensive patching -- sometimes more cost-effective if damage is widespread. Multiple layers of wallpaper (older homes may have 2-4 layers stacked). Borders and feature sections may have different adhesive to the main wallpaper. |

---

### F5. Painting Over Dark Colours

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it involves** | Painting over existing dark-coloured walls with a lighter or different colour. Dark colours bleed through standard paint and require additional preparation and coats to achieve full coverage. This is a common scenario in renovations where the new owner wants to lighten up rooms. |
| **Typical method** | (1) Clean and sand existing dark surface. (2) Apply primer/undercoat specifically to block the dark colour. A tinted primer (grey-tinted for covering very dark colours, or tinted to the new colour family) is more effective than white primer. (3) Apply top coats to full coverage. |
| **Coating system -- Light over dark** | 1-2 coats tinted/stain-blocking primer + 2 coats top coat. Total 3-4 coats. Using Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Super Hide Low Sheen can reduce total coats needed. Without proper primer, covering a dark colour may require 4-5 coats of regular paint. |
| **Coating system -- Dark over dark (colour change)** | 1 coat primer + 2 coats top coat. 3 coats total (similar to standard). |
| **Coating system -- Dark over light** | Tinted primer (tinted towards the new dark colour) + 2 coats dark top coat. For very saturated colours (red, deep blue, charcoal), may need 3 top coats. |
| **Recommended products** | Primer: Zinsser Bulls Eye 1-2-3 (stain-blocking), Dulux 1 Step Prep (tintable). Top coat: Dulux Wash&Wear +PLUS Super Hide Low Sheen (engineered for covering dark colours in 2 coats). |
| **Standard or conditional** | **Conditional** -- only when changing from dark existing colours. Must be identified during the quoting/assessment stage as it significantly affects product quantities and labour. |
| **Safety/compliance** | Same as standard wall painting. Additional coats mean more drying time between coats and longer overall project duration. |
| **Commonly forgotten** | The additional material cost (2-3x more paint/primer than a standard repaint). The additional labour time (each extra coat adds time). Colour bleeding through -- if primer is insufficient, dark colour will show as a tint through the new lighter colour, especially in certain lighting. Ceilings in dark-painted rooms may also need extra attention (dark wall colour often "reflected" onto ceiling over time). Scope should state "to full coverage" rather than a fixed number of coats, to account for variability. Plasterboard finish level -- dark paint may have hidden wall imperfections that become visible under the new lighter colour. |

## Summary: Commonly Forgotten Items Across All Areas

The following items are the most frequently omitted from residential painting scopes in Australia:

| Forgotten Item | Impact |
|---|---|
| Trim and skirting (all rooms) | 25-35% of total painting cost -- most commonly underquoted item |
| Doors (number, both faces, edges) | A 3-bed house has 12-15 doors. Panel doors take twice as long as flush. |
| Caulking gaps (trim-to-wall, architrave-to-wall) | Critical preparation step that dramatically affects finish quality |
| Ceiling painting (often "assumed included" but not scoped) | Every room has a ceiling -- easy to forget in room-by-room quoting |
| Walls behind appliances/furniture | Not accessible until items are moved; must be coordinated |
| Mould treatment before repainting (wet areas) | Painting over mould without treatment means it returns within months |
| Paint grade specification | "2 coats paint" is insufficient -- specify product class and finish |
| Preparation labour (especially exterior and wallpaper removal) | Prep is 50-70% of exterior painting cost; wallpaper removal is a major hidden cost |
| Primer coat on new surfaces | Skipping primer violates AS/NZS 2311 and causes visible joint lines |
| Scaffold hire (two-storey, stair voids, high ceilings) | Can add $1,500-$5,000+ to the project and is often not included in paint quotes |
| Number of colours | Each additional colour adds setup, material, and clean-up time |
| Return edges and transitions | Where colour changes occur -- specify exact locations |
| Curing time advisory | Wet area paint needs 48 hours no-steam and 7 days full cure |
| Lead paint testing (pre-1970 homes) | Legal requirement before disturbing old paint; testing costs $50-$150 per sample |
