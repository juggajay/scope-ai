## 1. Paint Finishes / Sheen Levels

### 1.1 Overview

Sheen (or gloss level) refers to how much light a painted surface reflects. It is measured at 60-degree and 85-degree angles using a gloss meter, expressed in gloss units (GU) from 0 (no reflection) to 100 (mirror-like). In Australia, the most common residential finishes are flat/matt, low sheen, semi-gloss, and gloss. Different brands use slightly different terminology for similar sheen levels.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- based on Dulux, Taubmans, and Haymes published product specifications.

### 1.2 Sheen Level Definitions and Where Used

| Sheen Level | Approx. Gloss Units (60-degree) | Where Used in Residential Renovations | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flat / Matt** | 0-10 GU | Ceilings (standard), low-traffic living areas, bedrooms. Flat is the default for all ceilings in Australian renovations. | Hides surface imperfections well (roller marks, plaster joints). Non-reflective. Least washable/durable. Not recommended for high-traffic or wet areas. |
| **Low Sheen** | 10-25 GU | General walls throughout the home -- the **most common wall finish** in Australian residential painting. Used in living rooms, bedrooms, hallways, kitchens (walls above splashback), laundries. | Velvety finish. Good balance of durability and imperfection-hiding. Modern premium low sheens (e.g. Dulux Wash & Wear) are highly washable. The default recommendation for all interior walls. |
| **Semi-Gloss** | 35-60 GU | Wet areas (bathroom walls and ceilings), trim/architraves, doors, window frames, skirting boards, high-traffic hallways, kitchen/bathroom cabinetry. | Durable, moisture-resistant, easy to clean. Shows surface imperfections more than low sheen. Standard for all timber trim and joinery in Australian renovations. |
| **Gloss / High Gloss** | 60-85+ GU | Feature trim, front doors, some joinery, metal surfaces. Less common in modern Australian residential than semi-gloss. | Hardest-wearing, most reflective. Shows every imperfection -- surface preparation must be excellent. Used more for exterior trim and feature elements. |

### 1.3 Brand-Specific Sheen Naming

Different Australian paint brands use different names for equivalent sheen levels. This table maps them:

| Sheen Level | Dulux | Taubmans | Haymes | British Paints | Wattyl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Flat / Ultra-flat** | Matt / Ceiling Flat | Matt / Ceiling White | Ultra Flat (Ceiling White) | Flat | Matt |
| **Low Sheen** | Low Sheen | Low Sheen | Low Sheen | Low Sheen | Low Sheen |
| **Eggshell** | *(not a separate tier)* | *(not a separate tier)* | Eggshell *(Haymes only)* | *(not a separate tier)* | *(not a separate tier)* |
| **Satin** | *(included in semi-gloss range)* | *(included in semi-gloss range)* | Satin | *(included in semi-gloss range)* | Satin |
| **Semi-Gloss** | Semi Gloss | Semi Gloss | Semi-Gloss | Semi Gloss | Semi Gloss |
| **Gloss** | High Gloss / Gloss | Gloss | Gloss | Gloss | Gloss |

**Key notes on sheen naming:**
- Haymes is the only major Australian brand that offers a distinct **Eggshell** finish (between low sheen and semi-gloss). It provides enhanced washability over low sheen with less reflection than semi-gloss.
- Dulux and Taubmans both skip from "Low Sheen" directly to "Semi Gloss" in their standard wall paint ranges.
- The term "Satin" is used by Haymes and Wattyl and sits between low sheen and semi-gloss. In other brands, semi-gloss effectively covers this range.
- For scope-of-works purposes, the AI should specify the **generic sheen level** (flat, low sheen, semi-gloss, gloss) rather than brand-specific names, since the homeowner may use any brand.

> **Scope Impact:** Every scope-of-works must specify the sheen level for each surface type. The standard residential renovation defaults are: **flat for ceilings, low sheen for walls, semi-gloss for trim/doors/wet areas.** Deviations from these defaults (e.g. low sheen in a bathroom) should be explicitly flagged with reasoning.

## 2. Paint Types

### 2.1 Acrylic (Water-Based) -- Walls & Ceilings

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Water-based paint using acrylic polymer binders. The standard paint type for all interior and exterior walls and ceilings in modern Australian construction and renovation. |
| **Where used** | All interior walls, ceilings, and some exterior surfaces. The overwhelming majority of residential painting in Australia uses acrylic paint. |
| **Advantages** | Low odour, fast drying (touch-dry 30 mins, recoat 2 hours typical), easy water clean-up, low VOC, non-yellowing, flexible (resists cracking), UV-stable. |
| **Limitations** | Standard acrylic is not hard enough for high-wear surfaces like doors, trim, and skirting boards (use enamel for these). Not suitable for surfaces that need a very hard, chip-resistant finish. |
| **Typical products** | Dulux Wash & Wear, Taubmans Endure, Haymes Expressions, Wattyl I.D., British Paints Clean & Protect |
| **Coverage** | 12-16 m2/litre on smooth plasterboard (varies by product and surface). |
| **Coats required** | 2 coats over a primed/sealed surface (new work). 2 coats over a sound previously painted surface (repaint). |

**Confidence:** HIGH -- industry-standard practice, confirmed by all major manufacturer specifications.

### 2.2 Enamel -- Trim, Doors & High-Wear Surfaces

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A harder, more durable paint formulation designed for surfaces that cop physical wear -- doors, skirting boards, architraves, window frames, and cabinetry. Available in two sub-types: oil-based enamel and water-based enamel. |
| **Oil-based enamel** | Traditional enamel. Extremely hard, self-levelling finish with minimal brush marks. Dries slowly (8-24 hours). Strong solvent odour during application. Requires turps/mineral spirits for clean-up. Yellows over time (especially whites). Being phased out in residential due to VOC concerns and drying time, but still used by some painters for premium trim work and in older homes to match existing finishes. |
| **Water-based enamel** | Modern replacement for oil-based. Dries faster (touch-dry 30-60 mins, recoat 2-4 hours). Low odour. Water clean-up. Non-yellowing. Technology has significantly improved -- high-quality water-based enamels now approach the hardness and finish of oil-based. **This is now the standard choice for trim in Australian renovations.** |
| **Where used** | Doors (both faces and edges), architraves, skirting boards, window frames/sills, door frames, built-in cabinetry, handrails, any high-wear timber or MDF surface. |
| **Typical sheen** | Semi-gloss is standard for trim enamel. Gloss is available but less common in modern residential. |
| **Typical products** | Dulux Aquanamel (water-based), Taubmans Endure Doors Trim & Cabinets, Haymes Trimplus, Wattyl Aqua Enamel |
| **Key spec note** | Standard wall acrylic should NOT be used on doors, trim, or skirting -- it is not hard enough and will scuff, chip, and mark. Enamel is specified for any surface that gets touched, bumped, or cleaned frequently. |

> **Scope Impact:** The scope must clearly distinguish between **acrylic (walls/ceilings)** and **enamel (trim/doors)**. These are different products at different price points, and the painter needs to know which surfaces get which type. A common scope mistake is specifying "paint" generically without specifying acrylic vs enamel by surface.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- confirmed by manufacturer product guides and trade painter consensus.

### 2.3 Ceiling Paint

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A flat/ultra-flat acrylic specifically formulated for ceilings. Not a fundamentally different paint type -- it is acrylic with an ultra-flat sheen and formulated for overhead application (thicker consistency to reduce dripping and spattering). |
| **How it differs from wall paint** | Ultra-flat sheen (hides roller marks, joints, and imperfections that ceiling light rakes across). Higher viscosity (less drip). Some products include anti-mould additives. Generally lower washability than wall paints (ceilings are rarely touched). Usually white-only or limited to very pale tints. |
| **Wet area variant** | Specific kitchen/bathroom ceiling paints include mould-inhibiting technology: Dulux Ceiling White +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom (10-year mould guarantee), Taubmans Easycoat Ceiling (Bacteria Shield technology). These should be specified for any ceiling in a bathroom, kitchen, or laundry. |
| **Typical products** | Dulux Ceiling White, Dulux Ceiling White +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom, Taubmans Easycoat Ceiling, Haymes Ceiling White |
| **Can you use wall paint on ceilings?** | Yes, but a flat/matt finish should be used. Dulux Wash & Wear Matt is marketed as suitable for ceilings. However, dedicated ceiling paints are formulated for better overhead application and are generally cheaper than premium wall paints. |

**Confidence:** HIGH -- manufacturer product specifications.

### 2.4 Bathroom / Wet Area Paint

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Acrylic wall paint with additional moisture-resistance, mould inhibitors, and antibacterial additives. Designed for walls and ceilings in bathrooms, kitchens, laundries, and other humid spaces. |
| **How it differs from standard wall paint** | Contains anti-mould / anti-bacterial technology. More moisture-resistant film. Usually formulated in low sheen or semi-gloss (both suitable for wet areas). |
| **Key products** | Dulux Wash & Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom (Low Sheen) -- includes mould inhibitor and water-repellent properties. Haymes Kitchen & Bathroom Interior Low Sheen -- bacteria, mould, and mildew resistant. Taubmans Endure -- all Endure products include anti-microbial technology as standard. |
| **Is it mandatory?** | Not mandatory by any standard, but strongly recommended for all wet area walls and ceilings. Standard paint in a poorly ventilated bathroom will develop mould. Anti-mould paint delays this but does not prevent it if ventilation is inadequate -- the scope should also address exhaust ventilation. |
| **Sheen for wet areas** | Semi-gloss is the traditional recommendation for wet areas (more moisture resistant, easier to wipe down). However, modern low-sheen kitchen/bathroom formulations perform well in all but the wettest areas (direct splash zones should still be tiled, not painted). |

> **Scope Impact:** The AI should specify kitchen/bathroom-grade paint for all walls and ceilings in bathrooms, kitchens, and laundries. This is a product upgrade from standard wall paint and may affect the painter's quote. Ceilings in wet areas should specify the wet-area ceiling paint variant (e.g. Dulux Ceiling White +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom), not standard ceiling paint.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- manufacturer specifications and trade practice.

## 3. Primer, Undercoat & Sealer Types

### 3.1 Primer vs Undercoat vs Sealer -- What's the Difference?

These three terms are often used interchangeably by homeowners, but they serve different purposes:

| Term | Purpose | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Primer** | Promotes adhesion of the topcoat to the surface. Penetrates and bonds to the substrate. Applied to **new, bare, or difficult surfaces**. | New plasterboard, new timber, bare masonry, new render, galvanised metal, previously unpainted surfaces, glossy surfaces (bonding primer). |
| **Sealer** | Seals porous or powdery surfaces to create a consistent base and prevent uneven topcoat absorption. | New set plaster, bare concrete, powdery old render, cement sheet, fibrous plaster. |
| **Undercoat** | Provides a uniform colour base and smooth surface for the topcoat. Fills minor imperfections and improves topcoat coverage. Thicker than primer. | Applied over primer (on new work) or over sound existing paint (on repaints) before the topcoat, to provide a uniform base -- especially important when changing from a dark colour to a light colour. |

**In practice:** Many modern products combine two or all three functions (e.g. "Primer, Sealer & Undercoat" or "3-in-1"). These multi-function products are the standard choice for most residential renovation work. The scope should specify the **type of prep coat** based on the surface condition.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- based on Dulux and Taubmans product specifications and AS/NZS 2311 guidance.

### 3.2 Primer Types by Surface

| Surface | Recommended Primer/Prep Coat | Key Products | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **New plasterboard (paper-faced)** | All-purpose acrylic primer/sealer/undercoat | Dulux 1Step Prep (water-based), Taubmans 3-in-1 | Apply 1-2 coats. A second coat may be needed over jointing compound to achieve even suction and hide joints. |
| **New set plaster / fibrous plaster** | Sealer binder (oil-based) | Dulux Precision Sealer Binder | Set plaster requires a sealer binder specifically -- do NOT use standard acrylic primer on new set plaster. Taubmans 3-in-1 also states "do not use on set plaster, fibrous plaster or plasterglass". |
| **New timber (pine, hardwood)** | Acrylic primer/undercoat with tannin-blocking properties | Dulux 1Step Prep, Taubmans 3-in-1 | Tannin bleeding is a major issue on Australian hardwoods (especially cedar, merbau, spotted gum). The primer must block tannin stains from bleeding through to the topcoat. Knots in softwood should be spot-sealed with shellac-based primer first. |
| **New MDF** | Acrylic primer/undercoat | Dulux 1Step Prep, Taubmans 3-in-1 | MDF edges are highly absorbent and may need 2 coats of primer on cut edges. |
| **Previously painted surfaces (sound)** | Light sand and 1 coat of acrylic undercoat, OR direct topcoat if existing paint is in good condition | Any acrylic undercoat / primer | If existing paint is sound, clean, and the same sheen type, a primer coat may not be needed -- 2 coats of topcoat can go directly over it. If changing from gloss to matt or there are adhesion concerns, a bonding primer is recommended. |
| **Previously painted surfaces (peeling/damaged)** | Sand back, scrape loose paint, spot-prime bare areas, then full undercoat | Dulux 1Step Prep on bare patches | All loose and flaking paint must be removed. Bare patches need priming. A full undercoat coat provides a uniform base. |
| **Stain blocking (water stains, smoke, nicotine)** | Shellac-based stain-blocking primer | Zinsser B-I-N (shellac-based), Dulux 1Step Prep (oil-based) for moderate stains | Water stains, nicotine, smoke damage, and tannin bleed will bleed through standard acrylic primers. Shellac-based primers (Zinsser B-I-N) are the gold standard for stain blocking -- they seal in one coat and block odours. For severe smoke/fire damage, shellac-based is the only reliable option. |
| **Glossy enamel surfaces (repainting)** | Bonding primer / adhesion primer | Dulux 1Step Prep, or sand and use standard acrylic primer | If repainting over old high-gloss enamel without sanding, a bonding primer provides adhesion without mechanical abrasion. |

> **Scope Impact:** The scope must specify the prep coat system based on the surface type. A common scoping error is stating "1 coat primer, 2 coats topcoat" without specifying WHICH primer for WHICH surface. The primer choice for new plasterboard vs new set plaster vs stain blocking are completely different products. The AI should identify the surface type from photos and questions, then specify the correct prep coat.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- based on manufacturer technical data sheets and AS/NZS 2311 requirements.

### 3.3 AS/NZS 2311:2017 Coat System Requirements

The Australian Standard AS/NZS 2311:2017 *Guide to the painting of buildings* specifies minimum coat systems:

| Surface Condition | Minimum System per AS/NZS 2311 |
|---|---|
| **New bare surfaces (plaster, timber, plasterboard)** | 3 coats total: 1 coat primer/sealer + 2 coats topcoat |
| **Previously painted surfaces (sound, compatible)** | 2 coats topcoat (assuming existing paint is sound and compatible) |
| **Spray application on plasterboard** | First and last coats must be back-rolled (to achieve even roller texture) |

**Note:** "3 coats on new work" is the industry-standard specification for Australian residential painting and should be the default in all scopes involving new surfaces. A painter quoting only 2 coats on new work is cutting corners.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- direct AS/NZS 2311:2017 reference.

## 4. Major Australian Paint Brands

### 4.1 Brand Tier Overview

Australian paint brands fall into roughly three tiers based on quality, price, and where professional painters position them:

| Tier | Brands | Position | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Premium** | Dulux (Wash & Wear, Aquanamel), Haymes (Ultra Premium range), Taubmans (Endure) | Top-tier residential paint. Best coverage, washability, durability. Higher price per litre. | Recommended for all visible residential renovation work. What most professional painters default to. |
| **Mid-Range / Trade** | Dulux Professional, Taubmans Professional, Wattyl (I.D., Ultra ranges) | Good quality, slightly lower price. Trade-focused products designed for professional application. Dulux Professional is the trade/volume range -- different formulation from Wash & Wear. | Large-scale new builds, investment properties, budget-conscious renovations. Wattyl occupies a solid mid-market position. |
| **Budget / Builder Grade** | British Paints (Clean & Protect), Wattyl (entry-level lines), store brands | Lowest price per litre. Acceptable coverage but lower washability, durability, and longevity. | Rental properties, builders doing handover painting, budget-constrained work. Not recommended for owner-occupied renovation unless budget is critical. |

**Are there significant quality differences between brands?** Yes. CHOICE testing of low-sheen interior paints in Australia has consistently found measurable differences in washability, stain resistance, scrub resistance, and coverage between premium and budget products. Premium paints (Dulux Wash & Wear, Haymes Expressions, Taubmans Endure) significantly outperform budget paints in long-term durability. The difference is most noticeable after 2-5 years of real-world use -- cheap paint shows marks and wear sooner.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- based on CHOICE testing summaries, trade painter consensus, and manufacturer positioning.

| **Notable** | Strong reputation for exterior paints (Solagard). Interior range is competent but generally considered a step below Dulux Wash & Wear and Taubmans Endure for premium residential interior work. Good value mid-range choice. |

> **Scope Impact:** The scope-of-works should NOT specify a paint brand (this is the painter's choice and preference). Instead, the scope should specify: (1) the quality tier -- "premium quality interior acrylic" or "premium quality water-based enamel", (2) the paint type -- acrylic or enamel, (3) the sheen level, and (4) any special requirements (e.g. anti-mould for wet areas). The painter then selects the specific product from their preferred brand. If the homeowner has a brand preference, this can be noted separately.

---

## 5. Colour Considerations for Scope-of-Works

### 5.1 Colour Selection is Typically Owner-Determined

In Australian residential renovations, paint colours are almost always selected by the homeowner (or their interior designer), NOT by the painter or the scope-of-works author. The scope should address colour in terms of:

- **Number of colours** (affects painter's quote -- more colours = more time masking, cutting in, and switching)
- **Type of colours** (dark colours may require additional coats)
- **Whether colours are specified or TBC** (if TBC, the scope should note this as a provisional item)

**Confidence:** HIGH -- standard Australian renovation practice.

### 5.2 Typical Colour Counts in Residential Renovation

| Element | Typical Number of Colours | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Walls** | 1-2 colours | Most renovations use 1 wall colour throughout, or 1 main colour + 1 feature/accent colour. Each additional colour increases labour (separate cut-in passes, masking). |
| **Ceilings** | 1 colour (white) | Ceiling white throughout is standard. Occasionally a homeowner will specify a coloured ceiling (feature) which should be called out separately. |
| **Trim (architraves, skirting, door frames)** | 1 colour (typically white or off-white) | All trim is usually the same colour. White or near-white semi-gloss enamel is the default. Dulux "Vivid White" and "Natural White" are extremely common trim colours in Australia. |
| **Doors** | 1 colour (matching trim, or feature colour) | Doors often match trim colour. Feature doors (e.g. front door, barn door) may be a different colour. |
| **Feature walls** | 0-1 | Not all renovations include a feature wall. If present, it is typically a single wall in a different (often darker) colour. |

### 5.3 Dark Colours -- Additional Coats and Cost Implications

Dark and ultra-deep paint colours present specific challenges:

| Issue | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Additional coats over light base** | Dark colours applied over a white/light primer may require **3 coats of topcoat** (instead of 2) to achieve full, even coverage. Some ultra-deep colours (e.g. dark navy, charcoal, deep red) may even require a tinted undercoat to reduce the number of topcoats needed. |
| **Light colours over existing dark** | Painting light over an existing dark colour is the most coat-intensive scenario. May require **stain-blocking primer + tinted undercoat + 2-3 topcoats** (4-5 coats total). This can add $100-$400+ per room to a painter's quote. |
| **Cost implication** | Each additional coat adds approximately 30-50% labour time for that surface. Paint consumption also increases. Dark-to-light colour changes on a whole-room basis can add $800-$1,500 to the painting cost. |
| **Scope specification** | The scope should note when dark colours are involved and flag the potential for additional coats. Use wording like: *"Allow for 3 coats of topcoat to feature wall (dark colour -- additional coat may be required for full coverage)."* |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- cost figures are approximate ranges based on trade painter estimates and renovation cost guides. Actual costs vary by region and painter.

### 5.4 Colour Matching for Touch-Ups / Partial Repaints

When a renovation involves partial painting (e.g. painting a new extension to match existing rooms, or touching up walls damaged during construction):

| Consideration | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Colour matching accuracy** | Paint stores can colour-match from a physical sample (a piece of painted plasterboard at least 50mm x 50mm). Digital colour-matching apps (Dulux Colour App, Taubmans Coloursmith) are less accurate. |
| **Fading and ageing** | Existing paint fades and changes tone over time (UV exposure, cleaning wear). Even a perfect colour match of the original colour will look different next to a 5-year-old faded surface. |
| **Touch-up vs full wall** | Touch-ups on a single wall almost always show, regardless of colour match accuracy, due to sheen differences between new and old paint. **The professional recommendation is to repaint the entire wall (corner to corner) rather than spot touch-up.** This should be reflected in the scope. |
| **Scope specification** | Where new work adjoins existing painted surfaces: *"Repaint full wall(s) corner-to-corner to match existing colour. Colour to be matched from existing by painter."* Do NOT scope spot touch-ups as a reliable finish method. |

> **Scope Impact:** The scope should specify colour counts (number of wall colours, trim colour, ceiling colour) and flag any colour-related cost drivers (dark colours, colour changes from existing, feature walls). Actual colour names are NOT included in the scope -- they are owner-selected. The scope can note: *"Colours: Owner to select. Allow for [X] wall colours, [1] ceiling colour (white), [1] trim/door colour."*

**Confidence:** HIGH -- standard trade practice.

## 6. Coverage Rates & Coats Required

### 6.1 Typical Coverage Rates (Australian Products)

| Paint Type | Coverage per Litre (smooth plasterboard) | Coverage per Litre (textured/rough surfaces) |
|---|---|---|
| **Interior wall acrylic (low sheen)** | 12-16 m2/litre | 8-10 m2/litre |
| **Ceiling flat acrylic** | 12-16 m2/litre | 8-12 m2/litre |
| **Water-based enamel (trim)** | 14-16 m2/litre | 10-12 m2/litre |
| **Primer/undercoat (acrylic)** | 12-16 m2/litre | 8-10 m2/litre |
| **Sealer binder (oil-based)** | 10-14 m2/litre | 6-10 m2/litre |
| **Stain-blocking primer (shellac)** | 10-12 m2/litre | 8-10 m2/litre |

**Notes:**
- First coat typically uses 15-20% more paint than second coat (surface absorption).
- Manufacturer-stated coverage rates assume ideal conditions. Real-world coverage is often 10-20% lower.
- Always allow an additional 10-15% for wastage, touch-ups, and cutting in.
- These rates are per coat -- multiply by number of coats to determine total paint volume.

### 6.2 Standard Coat Systems Summary

| Scenario | Coat System | Total Coats |
|---|---|---|
| **New plasterboard walls** | 1x primer/sealer + 2x acrylic topcoat | 3 |
| **New plasterboard ceiling** | 1x primer/sealer + 2x ceiling flat topcoat | 3 |
| **New set plaster** | 1x sealer binder + 2x acrylic topcoat | 3 |
| **New timber (trim/doors)** | 1x primer/undercoat + 2x enamel topcoat | 3 |
| **New MDF (trim/skirting)** | 1x primer/undercoat + 2x enamel topcoat (edges may need 2x primer) | 3 (3-4 on edges) |
| **Repaint -- walls (sound existing)** | 2x acrylic topcoat (direct over existing) | 2 |
| **Repaint -- trim (sound existing enamel)** | Light sand + 2x enamel topcoat | 2 |
| **Repaint -- dark to light colour change** | 1x stain-blocking primer or tinted undercoat + 2-3x topcoat | 3-4 |
| **Stained surfaces (water/smoke)** | 1x shellac stain-block primer + 1x undercoat + 2x topcoat | 3-4 |
| **Wet area walls (new)** | 1x primer/sealer + 2x kitchen/bathroom acrylic topcoat | 3 |
| **Wet area ceiling (new)** | 1x primer/sealer + 2x kitchen/bathroom ceiling topcoat | 3 |

> **Scope Impact:** The coat system is one of the most important specifications in a painting scope. It directly affects labour time, paint volume, and cost. The AI should always specify the coat system per surface type, not a blanket "3 coats everywhere". For repaints with sound existing paint, 2 coats of topcoat is standard. For new surfaces, 3 coats (1 primer + 2 topcoat) is the minimum per AS/NZS 2311.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- AS/NZS 2311 requirements and manufacturer application guides.

## 7. Relevant Australian Standards

| Standard | Title | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **AS/NZS 2311:2017** | Guide to the painting of buildings | The primary standard for residential painting in Australia. Specifies preparation requirements, coat systems, application methods, and quality requirements. All painting scopes should reference compliance with this standard. |
| **AS 3730** | Guide to the properties of paints for buildings | Specifies performance requirements for paint products (washability, scrub resistance, coverage, etc.). Used by manufacturers to rate their products. |
| **APAS (Australian Paint Approval Scheme)** | Voluntary paint certification | APAS certification confirms a paint product meets claimed performance specifications. Products carrying APAS approval numbers have been independently verified. |

### 7.1 VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) Considerations

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Regulation** | Australia does not have mandatory legislated VOC limits for architectural paint (as of 2026). VOC limits are voluntary under the APAS scheme (Document AP-D181). |
| **Low VOC definition** | Under 50 g/L TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds) is generally considered "low VOC" in Australia. |
| **Ultra-low / near-zero VOC** | Under 5 g/L. Products like Dulux envirO2 and Resene Zylone Sheen achieve this. |
| **Industry direction** | The Australian Paint Manufacturers Association has required all manufacturers to cease using the terms "VOC free" and "non VOC" since 2018, as trace VOCs may be present in raw materials. |
| **Scope relevance** | VOC levels are not typically specified in a residential renovation scope-of-works unless the homeowner has specific health concerns (asthma, chemical sensitivity, pregnancy). If requested, specify "low VOC interior acrylic (under 50 g/L TVOC)" or "ultra-low VOC" products. The Taubmans Endure range is Sensitive Choice approved by the National Asthma Council Australia. |

**Confidence:** HIGH -- APAS documentation and manufacturer specifications.
