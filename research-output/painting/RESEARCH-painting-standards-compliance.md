## 1. AS/NZS 2311:2017 -- Guide to the Painting of Buildings

**Current version:** AS/NZS 2311:2017 (Incorporating Amendment No. 1, September 2019)
**Prepared by:** Joint Technical Committee CH-003, Paints and Related Materials
**Published:** 3 March 2017
**Confidence:** HIGH (direct standard references)

AS/NZS 2311:2017 is the primary Australian/New Zealand standard governing the painting of buildings. It is the recognised industry standard for the painting industry. All work performed by a licensed or qualified painter should meet this standard.

### 1.1 Scope of the Standard

The standard provides guidance and recommended good practice for the design, application, and maintenance of decorative paint systems. It covers:

| Surface Type | Included |
|---|---|
| Timber (interior and exterior) | YES |
| Masonry (brick, block, rendered surfaces) | YES |
| Set plaster / fibrous plaster / plaster glass | YES |
| Gypsum plasterboard | YES |
| Concrete | YES |
| Metal installations (non-structural, within buildings) | YES |
| Building boards (fibre cement, etc.) | YES |
| Plastics | YES |
| Asbestos encapsulation/sealing | YES (reference only) |
| Structural steel exposed to atmosphere | NO (covered by AS/NZS 2312 series) |

### 1.2 Number of Coats -- Core Requirement

The most critical requirement for scope generation:

| Surface Condition | Minimum Coats Required | Typical System |
|---|---|---|
| **Bare/new plaster** | 3 coats | 1x sealer/primer + 2x topcoats |
| **Bare/new timber** | 3 coats | 1x primer/undercoat + 2x topcoats |
| **Bare/new plasterboard** | 3 coats | 1x sealer/undercoat + 2x topcoats |
| **Bare masonry** | 3 coats | 1x primer/sealer + 2x topcoats |
| **Bare metal (ferrous)** | 3 coats | 1x metal primer + 1x undercoat + 1x topcoat |
| **Previously painted -- good condition** | 2 coats | 2x topcoats (after preparation) |
| **Previously painted -- poor condition** | 3 coats | Full strip/sand, 1x primer + 2x topcoats |

**Key rule: Three coats must be applied to any bare plaster or timber surface.**

### 1.3 Three-Coat System Specification

The standard nominates a three-coat system for bare surfaces:

1. **First coat (Primer/Sealer):** A good quality sealer undercoat appropriate to the substrate. Seals porous surfaces, promotes adhesion, and provides a uniform base.
2. **Second coat (Undercoat/First Topcoat):** Builds film thickness and provides opacity/colour coverage.
3. **Third coat (Final Topcoat):** Provides the desired finish sheen, colour uniformity, and durability.

### 1.4 Spray Application -- Back-Rolling Requirement

When paint is applied by spray to a plasterboard surface, the first and last coat must be "back-rolled" -- that is, it must have a roller finish. This ensures proper adhesion and film integrity on plasterboard.

### 1.5 Surface Preparation Requirements

Surface preparation is one of the most emphasised aspects of AS/NZS 2311. The painter may be held liable for any future failure attributed to inadequate preparation.

| Preparation Step | Details |
|---|---|
| **Substrate assessment** | Assess condition of surface -- moisture content, structural integrity, contaminants |
| **Existing paint assessment** | Check for peeling, bubbling, flaking, chalking of original paint |
| **Contaminant removal** | Remove dirt, mould, mildew, rust, salt deposits, chalk |
| **Sanding** | Sand glossy surfaces to provide a key for new paint adhesion |
| **Filling/patching** | Fill holes, cracks, imperfections with appropriate filler |
| **Priming** | Apply appropriate primer for the substrate type |
| **Moisture testing** | Timber: max 15% moisture content. Masonry: allow adequate curing time (typically 28 days for new render) |

### 1.6 Environmental Conditions for Painting

| Condition | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Minimum temperature** | Do not apply if surface temperature is below 10 degrees C |
| **Maximum temperature** | Do not apply if surface temperature exceeds 30 degrees C |
| **Maximum relative humidity** | Do not apply above 85% relative humidity |
| **Dew point** | Surface temperature must be at least 3 degrees C above dew point |
| **Rain/wind** | Do not apply exterior coatings if rain is expected within drying time, or in strong wind |
| **Direct sunlight** | Avoid applying in direct strong sunlight on hot days (can cause blistering) |

### 1.7 Drying Times Between Coats

Drying times depend on product type and conditions, but typical minimums:

| Product Type | Minimum Recoat Time (typical) |
|---|---|
| Water-based acrylic (interior) | 2-4 hours |
| Water-based acrylic (exterior) | 2-4 hours |
| Oil-based enamel | 16-24 hours |
| Primer/sealer (water-based) | 2-4 hours |
| Primer/sealer (oil-based) | 16-24 hours |

**Note:** Always follow manufacturer-specific drying times. Recoating too early is a common cause of paint failure.

### 1.8 Related Standards

| Standard | Coverage |
|---|---|
| AS/NZS 2311:2017 | Painting of buildings (this standard) |
| AS/NZS 2312 series | Protection of structural steel (not applicable to most residential scopes) |
| AS/NZS 4361.1:2017 | Lead paint management -- Industrial |
| AS/NZS 4361.2:2017 | Lead paint management -- Residential & commercial buildings |
| AS/NZS 1580 series | Paints and related materials -- Methods of test |
| AS/NZS 3730 series | Guide to properties of paints for buildings |

**Scope Impact:** Every painting scope must specify a minimum three-coat system for bare/new surfaces and a two-coat system for previously painted surfaces in good condition. Surface preparation must be explicitly itemised -- it is not optional. Environmental conditions should be noted as a general condition. Spray application on plasterboard must include back-rolling.

## 2. VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) Regulations

**Confidence:** HIGH for APAS framework; MEDIUM for enforcement status

### 2.1 Overview of Australian VOC Regulation

Unlike the EU and USA, Australia does **not** have mandatory national VOC limits for architectural paints. VOC restrictions for paints are essentially **voluntary**, operating through the Australian Paint Approval Scheme (APAS), which is administered by CSIRO.

However:
- Government departments and major construction projects typically require APAS-certified paints
- Green Star certified buildings (Green Building Council of Australia) require low-VOC paints
- Consumer awareness and manufacturer competition have driven most major brands to low-VOC formulations
- Architectural coatings account for approximately 47,000 tonnes of VOC emissions per year (10% of national anthropogenic VOC emissions)

### 2.2 APAS VOC Classification System (AP-D181)

The Australian Paint Approval Scheme document AP-D181 defines VOC categories:

| APAS VOC Category | VOC Content (g/L) | Typical Products |
|---|---|---|
| Very Low | Less than 5 g/L | Premium interior latex paints (Dulux Wash & Wear, etc.) |
| Low | 5 -- 49 g/L | Standard interior latex paints, most water-based products |
| Moderate | 50 -- 99 g/L | Some specialty primers, sealers |
| High | 100 -- 249 g/L | Oil-based enamels, some specialty coatings |
| Very High | 250+ g/L | Solvent-based coatings, some industrial primers |

### 2.3 APAS VOC Limits for Key Architectural Coatings

| Product Category | APAS VOC Limit (g/L) |
|---|---|
| Interior latex paint -- flat/low sheen (low odour) | Less than 5 g/L (very low) |
| Interior latex paint -- semi-gloss (low odour) | Less than 5 g/L (very low) |
| Interior latex paint -- gloss (low odour) | Less than 5 g/L (very low) |
| Exterior water-based paint | Varies by specification |
| Primers and sealers (water-based) | 20 -- 30 g/L |
| Oil-based enamel | 100 -- 350 g/L |

### 2.4 Green Star / GBCA Requirements

For Green Star certified buildings (not mandatory for residential, but increasingly referenced):

| Product | Maximum TVOC (g/L of ready-to-use product) |
|---|---|
| Interior wall and ceiling paint (all sheens) | 16 g/L |
| Interior trim paint | 16 g/L |
| Primers and sealers | 65 g/L |
| Timber finishes (clear coatings) | 150 g/L |
| Adhesives and sealants | Varies by type |

### 2.5 NEPM and Air Quality Context

The National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) for Ambient Air Quality sets ozone standards that VOC emissions contribute to. In 2007, the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) established a working group to investigate national action to reduce VOC emissions from surface coatings. As of 2026, no mandatory national VOC limits for architectural coatings have been enacted, though the investigation recommended adoption of limits similar to international standards.

### 2.6 Practical Position for Residential Painting

| Aspect | Current Status |
|---|---|
| Mandatory VOC limits for residential paint | NO (voluntary via APAS) |
| Low-VOC paints recommended | YES (by all major manufacturers and industry bodies) |
| Low-VOC paints readily available | YES (standard offering from Dulux, Taubmans, Wattyl, Haymes) |
| Price premium for low-VOC | Minimal to none (now the default for premium interior products) |
| Most interior paints from major brands | Already low or very low VOC |
| Oil-based enamels | Higher VOC; water-based alternatives available for most applications |

**Scope Impact:** Scopes should specify "low-VOC" paints as the default for all interior work. This is not a legal requirement but is industry best practice and expected by most homeowners. Oil-based enamels may still be specified for high-wear trim and joinery where superior hardness is required, but note the higher VOC content and ventilation requirements.

## 3. Lead Paint Considerations

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from government publications, AS 4361.2, and industry safety bodies)

### 3.1 History of Lead in Australian Paint

| Year | Regulation |
|---|---|
| Pre-1965 | Lead paint widely used. Paint could contain up to 50% lead by weight |
| 1965 | Voluntary reduction began. Lead content in residential paint started declining |
| 1970 | Lead content in residential paint limited to 1% (by voluntary agreement) |
| 1992 | Maximum allowable lead reduced to 0.25% |
| 1997 | Lead formally banned at greater than 0.1% (1000 ppm) in residential and commercial paint |
| 2010 | Industrial paint reduced to 0.1% lead maximum |

**Key fact:** Approximately 3.7 million Australian homes were built before 1970 and the vast majority of these contain lead paint.

### 3.2 AS/NZS 4361.2:2017 -- Guide to Lead Paint Management (Residential & Commercial)

This is the governing standard for managing lead paint in residential and commercial buildings.

**Core principle:** For any home built before 1970 (and potentially before 1997), **assume the paint contains lead** unless testing proves otherwise.

### 3.3 Lead Paint Testing

| Test Method | Description | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **XRF (X-ray fluorescence)** | Portable device, non-destructive, instant results. Measures lead in mg/cm2 | HIGH -- industry standard |
| **Paint chip laboratory analysis** | Samples sent to NATA-accredited lab. Measures % lead by weight | HIGHEST -- definitive result |
| **Chemical colour-change kit** | DIY field test (e.g., 3M LeadCheck). Quick but lower accuracy | LOW -- screening only |

**Lead paint threshold:** Paint with lead levels greater than 1.0 mg/cm2 (by XRF) or 1.0% lead by weight (by lab analysis) requires management under AS 4361.2.

### 3.4 Management Options Under AS 4361.2

The standard provides a hierarchy of management approaches (in order of preference):

| Option | Description | When Appropriate |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Leave undisturbed** | Do nothing if paint is in sound condition and will not be disturbed | Paint intact, no renovation planned on that surface |
| **2. Stabilisation / Encapsulation** | Over-paint with encapsulant or fresh paint to seal lead paint in place | Paint in fair-to-good condition, no flaking/peeling. Most common for renovation painting scopes |
| **3. Enclosure** | Cover the surface (e.g., new plasterboard over painted walls) | Where physical covering is feasible |
| **4. Full removal** | Strip/remove all lead paint from surface | **Least preferred** -- greatest potential to generate hazardous lead dust. Required only when surfaces will be heavily disturbed or paint is severely deteriorated |

**Important:** Lead paint removal is the LEAST favoured option because it has the greatest potential to generate hazardous lead dust.

### 3.5 Safe Work Practices for Lead-Painted Surfaces

When any work disturbs lead-painted surfaces:

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Wet methods only** | Mist surface with water, use wet scraping and wet sanding to prevent lead dust becoming airborne |
| **No dry sanding** | NEVER dry sand, dry scrape, or dry abrasive blast surfaces containing lead paint |
| **No power tools (dry)** | Do not use orbital sanders, grinders, or heat guns above 500 degrees C on lead paint |
| **HEPA vacuum** | Use HEPA-filtered industrial vacuum for all dust collection. Household vacuums are NOT suitable |
| **Respiratory protection** | Half-face respirator with P2 particulate filter minimum |
| **Containment** | Seal work area with plastic sheeting. Prevent dust spreading to living areas |
| **Waste disposal** | Lead paint waste is hazardous -- must be disposed of at licensed facility |
| **Clearance testing** | After work, surface dust must be tested. Acceptable floor level: 1 mg/m2 (compared to 200+ mg/m2 from uncontrolled renovation) |
| **Professional recommendation** | DIY lead paint removal is not recommended. Use lead-trained contractors |
| **Training unit** | CPCCPD3031 -- Work safely with lead-painted surfaces in the painting industry |

### 3.6 Encapsulation for Renovation Painting Scopes

For most renovation painting scopes in pre-1970 homes, encapsulation (painting over) is the preferred approach:

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| 1. Test for lead | XRF or lab analysis recommended |
| 2. Assess paint condition | Encapsulation only works if existing paint is in sound condition (not peeling, flaking, or chalking) |
| 3. Wash and prepare surface | Wet methods only. Sugar soap wash, wet sand for adhesion key |
| 4. Apply binding primer | Use a high-adhesion primer/sealer (e.g., Zinsser Cover Stain, Dulux Precision Peel Stop) to bind any micro-flaking |
| 5. Apply topcoats | Standard three-coat system over primer |
| 6. Record keeping | Note that lead paint exists and has been encapsulated. Inform homeowner for future reference |

### 3.7 When to Escalate Beyond Painting Scope

A painting scope should flag but NOT attempt to resolve:

- Severely deteriorated lead paint (extensive peeling, flaking, chalking)
- Surfaces requiring mechanical stripping or sanding back to bare substrate
- Homes with visible lead dust contamination
- Any work involving children's bedrooms or play areas with deteriorated lead paint

These require specialist lead abatement contractors and are outside a standard painting scope.

**Scope Impact:** For ANY home built before 1970, the scope must include a lead paint assessment note. The default approach should be encapsulation (painting over with appropriate primer) unless paint is in poor condition. Scopes must specify wet preparation methods only. If surfaces require stripping, the scope should recommend lead testing and potentially flag specialist removal. Always note lead paint existence for homeowner records.

## 4. State-by-State Licensing Requirements

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from state government licensing bodies)

### 4.1 Licensing Summary

| State/Territory | Licence Required? | Issuing Body | Threshold (Work Value) | Qualification Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 5. Warranty -- Manufacturer & Workmanship

**Confidence:** HIGH for manufacturer warranties; MEDIUM for workmanship (industry practice)

### 5.1 Paint Product Warranties (Major Australian Manufacturers)

#### Dulux

| Product Range | Warranty Period | Coverage | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weathershield (exterior)** | Lifetime (while owner resides in home) | Will not peel, blister, or flake | Applied per instructions, suitable substrate, registration required |
| **Weathershield ColourGuard (exterior)** | Lifetime + colour fade protection | Peeling, blistering, flaking + colour fade resistance | Applied per instructions, registration required |
| **Wash & Wear (interior)** | Product durability 2-5 years (general) | Film integrity | Applied per instructions |
| **Wash & Wear +PLUS Anti-Bac** | 7 years against mould growth | Mould resistance | Applied per instructions |
| **Dulux Accredited Painter** | 5-year workmanship warranty | Peeling, flaking, blistering from faulty preparation/application | Work performed by Dulux Accredited painter only |

**Note:** Dulux warranties cover paint replacement only; they exclude labour and other charges.

#### Taubmans

| Product Range | Warranty Period | Coverage | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sunproof (exterior)** | 25 years | Will not blister, flake, or peel | Suitable and properly prepared surfaces |
| **All Weather (exterior)** | Lifetime guarantee | Blistering, flaking, peeling | While owner resides in home |
| **Endure (interior and exterior)** | Lifetime (while owner owns property) | Blistering, flaking, peeling | Applied per instructions |
| **Easycoat Kitchen & Bathroom** | 7 years against mould | Mould growth resistance | Applied per instructions |

#### General Notes on Paint Warranties

- Paint warranties cover the **product only** -- they warrant the paint will not fail under normal conditions when correctly applied
- Warranties do NOT cover failures due to poor surface preparation, incorrect application, or substrate movement
- Most require application in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions
- Registration may be required (especially for premium exterior products)
- Warranties are typically non-transferable (tied to the property owner who applied)

### 5.2 Workmanship Warranties (Contractor)

Workmanship warranty is separate from the paint product warranty. It covers the **quality of labour** -- surface preparation, application technique, and finish quality.

| Warranty Level | Duration | Industry Context |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimum acceptable** | 1 year | Bare minimum; any reputable painter should offer at least this |
| **Standard / common** | 2-5 years | Most professional painters offer 3-5 years |
| **Premium / industry best practice** | 5-8 years | High-end contractors, Dulux/Taubmans accredited painters |
| **Extended** | 8-15 years | Select premium contractors; often linked to premium products |

#### Australian State Minimum Durability Guidelines

Published state maintenance guides specify minimum expected durability:

| Finish Type | Minimum Durability |
|---|---|
| Exterior acrylic | 36 months (3 years) |
| Exterior enamel | 24 months (2 years) |
| Interior finishes | 36 months (3 years) |

### 5.3 What Workmanship Warranty Covers

Typical inclusions:
- Paint peeling, flaking, blistering due to faulty preparation
- Runs, sags, wrinkling caused by application errors
- Colour inconsistency or patchiness
- Unfilled depressions, cracks not properly treated
- Irregular brush marks or roller marks

Typical exclusions:
- Defects caused by substrate movement (e.g., timber shrinkage, structural settling)
- Damage from cleaning with abrasive products
- Normal wear and tear
- Damage from impact or modification after completion
- Failure due to use of paint not specified or supplied by the contractor

### 5.4 Paint Failure Timing

Paint failures may not appear immediately. The typical timeline:

| Timeframe | What May Appear |
|---|---|
| 0-6 months | Application defects (runs, sags, holidays, brush marks) |
| 6-18 months | Adhesion failures from poor preparation (peeling, flaking) |
| 2-3 years | Moisture-related failures (blistering, bubbling) |
| 3-5 years | Environmental degradation (chalking, fading -- exterior) |
| 5+ years | Normal end-of-service life (exterior); product warranty claims |

**Scope Impact:** The scope should recommend a minimum 5-year workmanship warranty from the painting contractor (industry best practice). Separately, the scope should specify premium-grade paint products that carry manufacturer warranties of 15+ years for exterior and lifetime for interior (Dulux Weathershield or equivalent for exterior; Dulux Wash & Wear or Taubmans Endure for interior). Note that warranty registration may be required for exterior products.

## 6. WHS Requirements for Painting Work

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from Safe Work Australia, state WHS regulators)

### 6.1 Working at Heights

Working at heights is the primary safety concern for painting work, governed by the WHS Act and Regulations in each state/territory.

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **High-risk threshold** | Work with risk of falling more than 2 metres is classified as **high-risk construction work** |
| **SWMS required** | A Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) must be prepared for any work where a person could fall more than 2 metres |
| **Hierarchy of controls** | 1. Eliminate (work at ground level where possible) > 2. Fall prevention (scaffolding, guardrails, EWPs) > 3. Work positioning > 4. Fall arrest (harness systems) |
| **Scaffolding** | Must be erected by a licensed scaffolder for scaffolds over 4 metres. Must comply with AS/NZS 1576 series |
| **Ladders** | Only appropriate for short-duration, light tasks (e.g., painting a downpipe, small touch-ups). NOT suitable for sustained painting at height |
| **Ladder-bracket scaffolds** | Only for very minor tasks. If platform is at 2+ metres height, must be used with physical fall prevention measures |
| **Elevated Work Platforms (EWPs)** | Operator must hold a High Risk Work Licence for boom-type EWPs over 11 metres |
| **Edge protection** | Required on all open edges where fall risk exceeds 2 metres |

#### Scaffolding Requirements for Residential Painting

| Aspect | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Under 4m height** | Can be erected by competent person (not necessarily licensed scaffolder) |
| **Over 4m height** | Must be erected by licensed scaffolder (High Risk Work Licence -- Scaffolding) |
| **Inspection** | Must be inspected before use and after any modification |
| **Planks/platforms** | Minimum 450mm wide, secured against displacement |
| **Guard rails** | Required on all open sides -- top rail at 900-1100mm, mid rail, and toe board |
| **Access** | Safe ladder access to each platform level |
| **Ties/bracing** | Must be tied to building structure at required intervals |

### 6.2 Respiratory Protection

| Scenario | Minimum RPE Required | Standard Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Brush/roller -- water-based paint (interior)** | None required (adequate ventilation sufficient) | General WHS duty |
| **Brush/roller -- oil-based paint (interior)** | Ventilation required. P2 mask recommended for prolonged exposure | AS/NZS 1715, 1716 |
| **Sanding (any paint type)** | P2 particulate filter mask minimum | AS/NZS 1715, 1716 |
| **Sanding lead-painted surfaces** | Half-face respirator with P2 particulate filter | AS 4361.2 |
| **Spray painting -- water-based** | Half-face respirator with A1 organic vapour cartridge + P2 particulate filter | Safe Work Australia Code of Practice |
| **Spray painting -- solvent-based** | Half-face respirator with A2 organic vapour cartridge + P2 particulate filter | Safe Work Australia Code of Practice |
| **Spray painting -- isocyanate-containing (2-pack)** | **Supplied air respirator (airline) MANDATORY.** Organic vapour cartridge respirators are NOT adequate | Safe Work Australia Code of Practice |

**Fit testing:** Under AS/NZS 1715, employers must conduct fit testing before first use. Wearers must be clean-shaven in the mask seal area.

### 6.3 Spray Painting Specific Requirements

The Safe Work Australia Model Code of Practice -- Spray Painting and Powder Coating (2020) applies:

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Ventilation** | Work area must be ventilated to AS/NZS 1668 standards, or use local exhaust ventilation |
| **Enclosed spaces** | Must not spray paint in confined spaces without mechanical exhaust ventilation |
| **Open construction** | If not using a spray booth, the building/structure should be of open construction OR mechanical exhaust must be used |
| **Fire risk** | Spray mists can create explosive atmosphere. No ignition sources within spray area |
| **Overspray containment** | Drop sheets, masking, and containment to prevent overspray on adjacent surfaces |
| **Bystander protection** | Exclusion zone around spray area. Residents should not be present during interior spray application |

### 6.4 Additional PPE Requirements

| Hazard | PPE Required |
|---|---|
| **Chemical splash (paint, solvents)** | Safety glasses or goggles. Nitrile or chemical-resistant gloves |
| **Overhead work** | Hard hat (construction sites) |
| **Skin contact (solvent-based products)** | Long sleeves, barrier cream, chemical-resistant gloves |
| **Noise (spray equipment, compressors)** | Hearing protection if noise exceeds 85 dB(A) |
| **Sun exposure (exterior work)** | Hat, sunscreen, long sleeves, adequate breaks |

### 6.5 SWMS (Safe Work Method Statement) Requirements

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **When required** | Painting work where a person could fall more than 2 metres, work in confined spaces, work involving hazardous chemicals, work near live electrical, work near traffic |
| **Content** | Must identify high-risk work, specify hazards, describe control measures, describe how controls will be implemented/monitored/reviewed |
| **Consultation** | Must be developed in consultation with workers |
| **Availability** | Must be available on-site for inspection |
| **Retention** | Must be kept until high-risk work is completed |

### 6.6 Confined Spaces

Painting in confined spaces (e.g., ceiling voids, under-floor areas, small utility rooms with poor ventilation):

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Risk assessment** | Required before entry |
| **Ventilation** | Forced mechanical ventilation required |
| **Atmospheric monitoring** | Required if using solvent-based products |
| **Standby person** | Required outside confined space |
| **Emergency plan** | Required before work commences |
| **Paint type** | Prefer water-based products. Solvent-based products create significantly higher risk in confined spaces |

**Scope Impact:** For any exterior painting or interior painting above 2 metres, the scope should note scaffolding or appropriate access equipment requirements. Scaffolding is a significant cost item and must be separately itemised. For interior spray application, the scope should note ventilation requirements and that residents may need to vacate during application. Lead paint (pre-1970 homes) requires specific respiratory protection to be noted. SWMS documentation should be listed as a contractor responsibility.

## 7. Key Scope-Writing Implications

### Always Include in Painting Renovation Scope:

1. **Coat specification** -- minimum 3 coats for bare surfaces, 2 coats for previously painted surfaces in good condition (per AS/NZS 2311:2017)
2. **Surface preparation** -- explicitly itemise: wash, sand, fill, prime. This is not optional
3. **Paint product specification** -- specify product tier (premium/standard), sheen level, and brand or equivalent. Low-VOC for interior
4. **Lead paint assessment** -- for any pre-1970 home, include lead paint note. Specify wet preparation methods and encapsulation approach
5. **Access/scaffolding** -- separately itemise scaffolding requirements for any work above 2 metres (exterior and interior high ceilings)
6. **Licensing** -- note that work must be performed by appropriately licensed/registered painting contractor
7. **Warranty** -- specify minimum 5-year workmanship warranty; note manufacturer product warranty separately
8. **Environmental conditions** -- note as general condition (temperature 10-30 degrees C, humidity below 85%, 3 degrees C above dew point)
9. **Protection/masking** -- itemise protection of floors, fittings, fixtures, adjacent surfaces
10. **Clean-up and waste disposal** -- include as a line item

### Surface-Specific Scope Notes:

| Surface | Key Scope Considerations |
|---|---|
| **Plasterboard (new)** | 3 coats. First coat back-rolled if sprayed. Joints and patches sealed |
| **Timber (new)** | 3 coats. Knots treated with shellac-based sealer. Grain raised and sanded between coats |
| **Timber (exterior, weathered)** | Full preparation critical. May need timber preservative before painting |
| **Masonry/render (new)** | Allow 28 days curing. 3 coats with alkali-resistant primer |
| **Previously painted (good condition)** | 2 coats after wash, sand, fill. Test adhesion first |
| **Previously painted (poor condition)** | Strip loose paint, sand edges, fill, prime bare areas, 2-3 topcoats |
| **Metal (ferrous)** | Remove rust, apply rust-converting primer, 2 topcoats |
| **Wet areas (bathroom, laundry)** | Specify mould-resistant paint (e.g., Dulux Wash & Wear +PLUS Kitchen & Bathroom) |

### Common Scope Omissions to Avoid:

- Not specifying number of coats (the most common homeowner complaint)
- Omitting surface preparation (leads to early failure and warranty disputes)
- Forgetting scaffolding costs for multi-storey exteriors
- Not addressing lead paint in pre-1970 homes
- Failing to specify paint product tier (premium vs budget)
- Not itemising protection/masking as a separate item
- Omitting drying time between coats (causes callbacks)
- Not specifying primer type for each substrate
- Forgetting to include caulking of gaps/joints before painting
- Not distinguishing between walls and ceilings (different access, different sheen)
