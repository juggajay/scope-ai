## 7.1 Painter Labour Rates by City

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

| City | Hourly Rate (Client-Facing) | Notes |
|------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $50 -- $80/hr | Highest in Australia; premium painters up to $100--$110/hr |
| **Melbourne** | $45 -- $75/hr | Second highest; strong demand in inner suburbs |
| **Brisbane** | $40 -- $60/hr | More competitive; slightly lower cost of living |
| **Perth** | $50 -- $90/hr | High variability; material transport costs add overhead |
| **Adelaide** | $35 -- $55/hr | Most competitive major city market |

> **Note:** These are what clients are billed, not the painter's wage. The employee wage for a qualified painter is approximately $30--$37/hr (award rate). Client-facing rates include overheads, insurance, vehicle, equipment, and margin.

---

## 7.2 Per Room -- Standard Bedroom (3m x 4m)

**Confidence:** HIGH

Assumes: walls + ceiling, standard 2.7m ceiling height, existing painted surfaces in reasonable condition, prep (light sand, spot fill, dust down), 2 coats of quality acrylic.

| City | Price Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $500 -- $1,000 | Higher end if trims/doors included |
| **Melbourne** | $450 -- $900 | |
| **Brisbane** | $400 -- $800 | |
| **Perth** | $400 -- $850 | |
| **Adelaide** | $350 -- $700 | |
| **National Average** | $400 -- $900 | Walls + ceiling only; add $150--$300 if door, skirting, and architraves included |

> A full bedroom repaint including walls, ceiling, skirting, architraves, door, and window can run $800--$1,900+ depending on condition. One regional source (Ballarat, VIC) quotes $1,600--$1,900 for a bedroom in good condition including all surfaces, or $2,900--$3,300 if in poor condition (stained trims, lacquered surfaces requiring additional prep).

**Sources:** Brushworks 2025, ServiceTasker 2026, BCR Painting Ballarat 2025/26

---

## 7.3 Per Room -- Bathroom (Above Tile Line + Ceiling)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (less frequently itemised separately)

Assumes: painting above tile line on walls + ceiling only, existing surfaces, 2 coats of moisture-resistant paint (semi-gloss or satin finish), standard bathroom ~2.5m x 3m.

| City | Price Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $350 -- $700 | |
| **Melbourne** | $300 -- $600 | |
| **Brisbane** | $250 -- $550 | |
| **Perth** | $280 -- $600 | |
| **Adelaide** | $220 -- $500 | |
| **National Average** | $250 -- $600 | Smaller paintable area but specialist paint required |

> **Key considerations:** Bathrooms require mould/mildew-resistant paint (e.g., Dulux Wash & Wear Kitchen & Bathroom). The paintable area is significantly reduced by tiling, often only the upper 300--600mm of walls plus ceiling. Ceiling access in small bathrooms can be awkward. Allow 4--6 hours for a professional on a medium bathroom. Painting cabinets/vanity adds 30--50% to labour time.

**Sources:** Airtasker AU 2025, Brushworks 2025, ServiceTasker 2026

---

## 7.4 Per Room -- Kitchen (Walls + Ceiling, Excluding Cabinetry)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

Assumes: walls + ceiling only, not including splashback area (tiled or glass), not including cabinetry, existing painted surfaces, 2 coats of washable paint.

| City | Price Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $500 -- $1,200 | Kitchens tend to be larger rooms with more cutting-in |
| **Melbourne** | $450 -- $1,000 | |
| **Brisbane** | $400 -- $900 | |
| **Perth** | $400 -- $950 | |
| **Adelaide** | $350 -- $800 | |
| **National Average** | $400 -- $1,000 | Higher than bedrooms due to more obstacles and cutting-in |

> **Key considerations:** Kitchens require more cutting-in around cabinetry, rangehood, and appliances. Open-plan kitchen/living layouts will be priced as a larger combined area. Washable paint (e.g., Dulux Wash & Wear) is standard for kitchens. If new plasterboard is involved (renovation), see Section 7.6 for the additional sealer/primer system cost.

**Sources:** Brushworks 2025, Airtasker AU 2025, PaintersLink 2025

---

## 7.5 Per Square Metre -- Walls (Existing Surfaces, 2 Coats)

**Confidence:** HIGH (most commonly quoted metric)

Assumes: existing painted surfaces in reasonable condition, light prep (spot fill, sand, dust), 2 coats quality acrylic interior paint.

| City | Rate Range (per m2) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $22 -- $45/m2 | Can reach $60+/m2 for premium finish |
| **Melbourne** | $20 -- $40/m2 | |
| **Brisbane** | $18 -- $35/m2 | |
| **Perth** | $20 -- $40/m2 | |
| **Adelaide** | $15 -- $30/m2 | |
| **National Average** | $20 -- $35/m2 | Standard 2-coat system on existing paint |

> **Important:** These rates are for wall surface area, not floor area. A 3m x 4m room with 2.7m ceilings has approximately 37.8m2 of wall area and 12m2 of ceiling -- totalling ~50m2 of paintable surface.

---

## 7.6 Per Square Metre -- Walls (New Plasterboard, Full System)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (fewer specific sources; derived from component pricing)

Assumes: new plasterboard (post-renovation), full coating system: 1 coat sealer/primer + 2 coats quality acrylic topcoat. New plasterboard is porous and absorbs the first coat, requiring a dedicated sealer before topcoats.

| City | Rate Range (per m2) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $28 -- $55/m2 | |
| **Melbourne** | $25 -- $50/m2 | |
| **Brisbane** | $22 -- $45/m2 | |
| **Perth** | $25 -- $50/m2 | |
| **Adelaide** | $20 -- $40/m2 | |
| **National Average** | $25 -- $45/m2 | ~25--30% premium over existing surface rates |

> **Why more expensive:** New plasterboard requires a dedicated sealer coat (e.g., Dulux 1 Step Acrylic Primer Sealer Undercoat) before topcoats. This adds one full extra coat to the system. The sealer soaks into the porous board and must dry before topcoats are applied, adding time. Total system is typically: 1x sealer/primer + 2x topcoats = 3 coats vs 2 coats on existing. Material costs are also higher due to the additional primer product.

**Sources:** Brushworks 2025, BCR Painting 2025/26, industry standard practice (AS/NZS 2311)

---

## 7.7 Per Square Metre -- Ceiling

**Confidence:** HIGH

Assumes: existing painted ceiling, standard 2.7m height, 2 coats flat/matt ceiling white.

| City | Rate Range (per m2) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $12 -- $25/m2 | |
| **Melbourne** | $10 -- $22/m2 | |
| **Brisbane** | $8 -- $20/m2 | |
| **Perth** | $10 -- $22/m2 | |
| **Adelaide** | $8 -- $18/m2 | |
| **National Average** | $10 -- $22/m2 | Generally cheaper than walls per m2 |

> **Notes:** Ceilings are typically cheaper per m2 than walls because they use flat white paint (cheaper product) and involve less cutting-in. However, they are physically harder to paint (overhead work, roller spatter). Ceilings above 2.7m height attract a surcharge of approximately 5% per additional 300mm of height. Textured ceilings (e.g., stipple) may cost 10--20% more.

**Sources:** Airtasker AU 2025, ServiceTasker 2026, Golden Deco Melbourne 2026, BCR Painting 2025/26

---

## 7.8 Per Door -- Existing Timber (Both Sides + Frame + Architrave)

**Confidence:** HIGH

Assumes: existing painted timber door, both sides, including door frame and architrave on both sides, light sand and prep, 2 coats semi-gloss or satin enamel.

| City | Price Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $200 -- $450 | Complex panel doors or french doors higher |
| **Melbourne** | $180 -- $400 | |
| **Brisbane** | $150 -- $350 | |
| **Perth** | $170 -- $380 | |
| **Adelaide** | $130 -- $300 | |
| **National Average** | $150 -- $400 | Includes door (both sides), frame, and architrave (both sides) |

> **Breakdown estimate:** Door leaf (both sides) ~$80--$200, frame ~$40--$80, architrave (both sides) ~$50--$120. A flat flush door is at the lower end; a 4-panel or 6-panel door takes significantly longer due to cutting-in around mouldings. Enamel paints (required for doors/trim) take longer to apply and dry than wall acrylics.

**Sources:** ServiceTasker 2026, Sydney Elite Painters 2025, Brushworks 2025, PaintersLink 2025

---

## 7.9 Per Door -- New Timber (Full System)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

Assumes: new raw timber or primed door, full coating system: 1 coat primer/undercoat + 2 coats semi-gloss or satin enamel. Includes frame and architrave.

| City | Price Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $250 -- $550 | |
| **Melbourne** | $220 -- $500 | |
| **Brisbane** | $200 -- $450 | |
| **Perth** | $220 -- $480 | |
| **Adelaide** | $180 -- $400 | |
| **National Average** | $200 -- $500 | ~25--35% more than existing door due to extra coat |

> **Notes:** New doors require a full undercoat before topcoats (3-coat system). If the door comes factory-primed (common for new doors), the undercoat step may be reduced to a light sand and one additional coat. Spray application on new doors can produce a superior factory-like finish and may be preferred by some painters (see Section 7.15).

## 7.10 Per Linear Metre -- Trim / Skirting / Architrave

**Confidence:** HIGH

Assumes: existing painted timber skirting or architrave, light prep, 2 coats semi-gloss or satin enamel.

| Item | Rate Range (per lin. m) | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| **Skirting boards** | $5 -- $12/lm | Standard 90--140mm skirting |
| **Architrave** | $4 -- $10/lm | Standard 60--90mm architrave |
| **Window sills** | $6 -- $15/lm | Horizontal surface collects more wear |
| **Picture rails / dado rails** | $4 -- $10/lm | |
| **Cornice (painted)** | $4 -- $10/lm | Usually painted with ceiling |

> **Context:** Trim work is labour-intensive relative to area covered because it requires careful cutting-in by brush. A standard bedroom (3m x 4m) has approximately 14 linear metres of skirting. Skirting in poor condition (chipped, multiple layers, lacquered) can double the prep time and cost.

**Sources:** ServiceTasker 2026, BCR Painting 2025/26, HiPages, Master Painters Association estimation references

---

## 7.11 Per Window -- Frame + Sill (Both Sides)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

Assumes: existing painted timber window, both interior and exterior faces, frame + sill + architrave, light prep, 2 coats enamel.

| Window Type | Price Range | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| **Standard single window** | $80 -- $200 | Typical 900mm x 1200mm |
| **Large window / picture window** | $150 -- $350 | 1500mm+ wide |
| **Double-hung (traditional)** | $120 -- $300 | Multiple sash edges add time |
| **French windows / multi-pane** | $200 -- $400+ | Each pane requires cutting-in |

> **Notes:** Window painting is one of the most time-consuming per-item tasks due to the precision required around glass. Many painters recommend taping or using a shield. Aluminium or vinyl windows do not typically require painting (and spray painting aluminium windows is a separate specialist service at $150--$500+ per window).

## 7.12 Full Interior Repaint -- 3-Bedroom Home

**Confidence:** HIGH (most commonly quoted project type)

Assumes: standard 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom home, ~100--130m2 floor area, all walls, ceilings, doors, trims, existing painted surfaces in reasonable condition, 2 coats throughout.

| City | Price Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $6,000 -- $10,000 | |
| **Melbourne** | $5,000 -- $9,500 | |
| **Brisbane** | $4,500 -- $7,500 | |
| **Perth** | $4,500 -- $8,000 | |
| **Adelaide** | $3,500 -- $6,500 | |
| **National Average** | $4,500 -- $8,500 | Walls, ceilings, doors, trims, skirting |

> **What's typically included:** All walls (2 coats), all ceilings (2 coats), all doors both sides with frames and architraves, all skirting boards, all window trims. Light prep throughout (spot filling, sanding). Paint supply (builder standard or mid-range quality). Protection of floors and furniture.
>
> **What's NOT typically included:** Wallpaper removal, extensive plaster repair, feature/accent colours beyond 2--3 colours, moving heavy furniture, exterior painting, painting inside wardrobes/cupboards.

## 7.13 Renovation-Specific Painting -- New Plasterboard Throughout Kitchen Reno

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (derived from component rates)

Assumes: typical kitchen renovation (~12--20m2 floor area), all new plasterboard walls and ceiling, full coating system (sealer + 2 coats), does not include cabinet painting.

| Component | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Walls (new plasterboard, ~30--45m2 surface)** | $750 -- $2,000 | At $25--$45/m2 full system |
| **Ceiling (new plasterboard, ~12--20m2)** | $200 -- $600 | At $15--$30/m2 for new surface |
| **Door (1--2 doors, new)** | $200 -- $500 each | Full system on new door |
| **Skirting + architrave (new, ~15--25lm)** | $120 -- $350 | Full system on new timber |
| **Window trim (1--2 windows)** | $80 -- $200 each | |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED RANGE** | $1,500 -- $4,000 | Kitchen renovation painting package |

> **Notes:** Renovation painting on new surfaces costs 25--35% more than repainting existing surfaces due to the additional sealer/primer coat required. Painters prefer to do renovation painting in one visit after all plasterboard is installed, jointed, sanded, and dust-free. Coordination with plasterer is critical -- paint too early and joints may crack; too late and you delay the project.

**Sources:** Component rates from Sections 7.6--7.11, industry practice

## 7.14 Touch-Up Visit

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

| Scenario | Typical Practice | Cost if Separate |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Touch-ups after painting (same project)** | Usually INCLUDED in original quote | N/A |
| **Defects touch-up visit (within warranty)** | INCLUDED -- standard practice is 1 return visit within 2--4 weeks | N/A |
| **Touch-up after other trades (renovation)** | Usually an EXTRA charge | $200 -- $500 per visit |
| **Touch-up visit (separate callout, minor)** | Extra -- treated as a new job | $250 -- $500 (minimum half-day charge) |

> **Key points for renovation scopes:**
> - In a renovation context, painters typically need TWO visits: an initial paint (after plastering) and a final touch-up/defect paint (after all other trades have finished -- e.g., after electrician, plumber, cabinet installer have done final fix).
> - The final touch-up visit is almost always a separate line item and should be included in the painting scope. It typically covers filling and repainting any scuffs, nail holes from other trades, marks from installation, and final door/trim touch-ups.
> - Budget $200--$500 for a touch-up visit on a single-room renovation, or $300--$800 for a multi-room renovation.
> - This is standard practice per AS/NZS 2311 which defines touch-up as correction of defects from the painter's own work. Damage caused by other trades is the responsibility of the respective trade or builder.
> - Workmanship warranties from professional painters typically cover 1--2 years for interior work.

## 7.15 Spray Application vs Brush/Roller

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

| Factor | Spray | Brush/Roller |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Speed (application only)** | 2--3x faster | Standard baseline |
| **Prep time** | HIGH -- extensive masking/sheeting required | LOW -- minimal masking |
| **Paint consumption** | 20--30% MORE due to overspray | Standard -- more efficient application |
| **Finish quality** | Superior smooth, factory-like finish | Good -- slight texture from roller nap |
| **Best for** | New builds, empty rooms, ceilings, doors/trim, large open areas | Furnished rooms, detail work, small rooms, textured walls |
| **Equipment cost** | $400--$800 to buy; $100--$150/day rental | Under $100 total |
| **Cost to client** | Generally SIMILAR to brush/roller for most jobs | Standard baseline |

> **Price impact:** For a standard furnished interior repaint, spray vs brush/roller typically results in similar overall pricing because the time saved in application is offset by additional masking/prep time. For empty rooms or new builds, spraying can be 10--15% cheaper due to the speed advantage without the masking penalty. For doors and trim specifically, spray application produces a noticeably better finish and is increasingly preferred by quality painters.
>
> **Common approach:** Most experienced Australian painters use a HYBRID method -- spray ceilings and large wall areas, then back-roll for adhesion and consistency, and use brush for cutting-in and detail work.

## 7.16 Premium Paint vs Builder Grade

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Paint Tier | Typical Product (Dulux) | Cost per 10L | Coverage | Durability |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Builder grade / budget** | Dulux Wash & Wear Low Sheen (base) | $55 -- $70 | 14--16 m2/L | 5--6 years |
| **Mid-range** | Dulux Wash & Wear +PLUS / Aquanamel | $75 -- $90 | 14--16 m2/L | 8--10 years |
| **Premium** | Dulux Weathershield / Professional | $95 -- $120 | 16--18 m2/L | 12--15 years |

| Impact | Cost Difference per Room (3m x 4m) | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **Builder grade to mid-range** | +$30 -- $60 per room | Better washability, scuff resistance |
| **Builder grade to premium** | +$60 -- $120 per room | Significantly better coverage, durability, colour retention |
| **Labour cost difference** | Minimal -- same application time | Premium paint often covers better, slightly reducing labour |

> **Key insight:** The paint material itself is a relatively small portion of the total job cost (typically 15--25% of the total). Labour is 60--75% of the cost. Upgrading from builder grade to premium paint adds only $30--$120 per room in material costs but significantly improves durability and finish. Most professional painters recommend mid-range to premium paint as the cost difference is modest relative to the total project.

## 7.17 Extra Coats -- Dark Colours or Colour Changes

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Scenario | Standard Coats | Extra Coats Needed | Additional Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Same colour refresh (white to white)** | 2 coats | None | Standard pricing |
| **Light to light colour change** | 2 coats | Usually none | Standard pricing |
| **Light to dark colour** | 2 coats | +1 coat (3 total) | +30--50% per surface |
| **Dark to light colour** | 2 coats | +1--2 coats (3--4 total) | +40--80% per surface |
| **Dark to dark (different colour)** | 2 coats | +1 coat (3 total) | +30--50% per surface |
| **Bold/saturated colour (red, deep blue)** | 2 coats | +1--2 coats (3--4 total) | +40--80% per surface |

| Cost Impact (Full Room 3m x 4m) | Estimate |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| **1 extra coat (walls + ceiling)** | +$150 -- $400 |
| **2 extra coats (walls + ceiling)** | +$300 -- $700 |
| **Per m2 uplift for 3-coat system** | +$8 -- $15/m2 |

> **Melbourne-specific data:** One Melbourne source quotes $20--$28/m2 for 2 coats vs $30--$33/m2 for 3 coats (plus GST), confirming approximately a 15--25% premium for the third coat.
>
> **Best practice:** When changing from a dark to light colour, using a tinted primer/sealer as the first coat (tinted towards the new colour) can reduce the number of topcoats needed. This is standard practice for professional painters.

## 7B.1 Day Rates

**Confidence:** HIGH

| City | Day Rate (per painter) | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| **Sydney** | $450 -- $700/day | Based on $55--$80/hr x 8hrs |
| **Melbourne** | $400 -- $650/day | Based on $50--$75/hr x 8hrs |
| **Brisbane** | $350 -- $550/day | Based on $40--$60/hr x 8hrs |
| **Perth** | $400 -- $700/day | High variability |
| **Adelaide** | $300 -- $500/day | Most affordable capital city |
| **National Average** | $350 -- $650/day | Per individual painter |

> **Note:** Day rates are less common for residential work (most painters quote per room or per project), but they are relevant for renovation work where the painter is on-site alongside other trades. Minimum engagement is typically half a day (4 hours). Some painters apply a minimum charge of $300--$400.

## 7B.2 Typical Crew Sizes

**Confidence:** HIGH (industry knowledge)

| Project Type | Typical Crew | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Single room repaint** | 1 painter | Solo operator common |
| **2--3 room repaint** | 1--2 painters | |
| **Full house interior** | 2--3 painters | Standard crew for efficiency |
| **Large renovation** | 2--4 painters | May include apprentice |
| **Commercial / new build** | 3--6+ painters | With spray equipment |

> **Industry note:** Most residential painting businesses are small operations -- either a sole trader or a painter with 1--2 employees/subcontractors. A team of 2--3 is the most common for a full-house repaint. Larger crews (3+) are more common for new builds or commercial work. The industry has a significant apprentice presence, and quotes may assume an apprentice is part of the crew (lower hourly rate but supervised).

---

## 7B.3 Typical Room Timeframes

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Room Type | Time Estimate (1 Painter) | Time Estimate (2 Painters) | Includes |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Standard bedroom (3m x 4m)** | 6--8 hours (1 day) | 4--5 hours | Walls, ceiling, prep, 2 coats, drying between coats |
| **Small room / study** | 4--6 hours | 3--4 hours | |
| **Bathroom (above tile + ceiling)** | 4--6 hours | 3--4 hours | Smaller area but awkward access |
| **Kitchen (walls + ceiling)** | 6--10 hours | 4--6 hours | More cutting-in around cabinetry |
| **Living room (large, 5m x 6m)** | 8--12 hours (1--1.5 days) | 5--7 hours | |
| **Single door + frame + architrave** | 1.5--3 hours | N/A | Both sides, enamel |
| **Full 3-bed house interior** | 4--6 days | 3--4 days | All surfaces |

> **Prep time:** Surface preparation (filling, sanding, priming damaged areas, taping, floor protection) typically accounts for 30--50% of total project time. Rushing prep is the most common cause of poor paint outcomes.
>
> **Drying time:** Professional painters typically apply coat 1, move to another area while it dries (2--4 hours for water-based acrylics), then return for coat 2. This is why multi-room jobs are more efficient per room than single-room jobs.

## 7B.5 2025--2026 Pricing Trends

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (directional trends, not precise figures)

| Factor | Trend | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Paint material costs** | UP 6.2% since 2024 | Directly increases material component of quotes |
| **Labour costs** | UP -- high demand, trades shortage | Strongest upward pressure on total costs |
| **Construction activity** | Elevated -- renovation boom continues | Keeps painter demand high, longer wait times |
| **Availability** | 4--6 week wait typical in capital cities | Book early; short-notice jobs attract premiums |
| **Overall pricing direction** | UP 5--10% year-on-year | Consistent with broader construction inflation |

> **Context for homeowners:** The Australian residential renovation market remains active in 2025--2026, keeping demand for painters high. Material costs (paint, primers, consumables) have risen ~6% year-on-year. Labour rates continue to climb due to skilled trades shortages. Homeowners should budget 5--10% above published guide prices if planning a project 6+ months out, and always obtain 2--3 competitive quotes.
