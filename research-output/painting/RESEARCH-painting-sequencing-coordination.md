## 1. Why Painting Is Last in the Renovation Sequence

Painting is almost always the **second-to-last trade** in any Australian residential renovation — scheduled after all other construction and installation work, but before the final clean. This positioning is not arbitrary; it is driven by several practical realities:

### Paint is fragile during and after application

Fresh paint is vulnerable to scuffs, scratches, dust adhesion, and impact damage. Every trade that works after the painter risks damaging the finish. By scheduling painting last, the number of trades that follow (and could cause damage) is minimised to essentially zero — only the final clean remains.

### Dust is paint's enemy

Plastering, sanding, tiling, cutting timber, and drilling all generate fine dust. If painting occurs while dust-generating work is still happening in the same space, dust particles settle into wet paint, creating a gritty, unprofessional finish. Even dust from adjacent rooms travels through doorways and via HVAC systems. All dust-generating work must be complete and the space thoroughly cleaned before painting begins.

### Surfaces must be at their final state

Painters need to see every junction, edge, and surface in its finished condition. If skirting boards are not yet installed, the painter cannot cut a clean line at the wall-to-skirting junction. If the electrician has not yet installed cover plates, the painter cannot finish around power points. Painting to an incomplete surface means a guaranteed return visit.

### Australian Standard AS/NZS 2311:2017 alignment

The Australian Standard for painting of buildings (AS/NZS 2311:2017) specifies surface preparation requirements that assume the substrate is in its final condition — plastered, sanded, primed, and free of contaminants. Painting over surfaces that will later be modified (e.g., skirting not yet installed, patches not yet made) does not comply with the intent of the standard.

### The typical renovation sequence

```
1.  Demolition
2.  Structural work (walls, beams, lintels)
3.  Plumbing rough-in (first fix)
4.  Electrical rough-in (first fix)
5.  Waterproofing (wet areas)
6.  Plastering / gyprocking
7.  Floor levelling / screeding
8.  Tiling (floor and walls)
9.  Cabinetry installation
10. Benchtop installation (stone/laminate)
11. Second-fix plumbing (pipework connections behind walls)
12. Second-fix electrical (wiring connections behind walls)
13. Carpentry — skirting, architraves, door hardware
14. >>> PAINTING <<<
15. Final plumbing fit-off (tapware, accessories)
16. Final electrical fit-off (cover plates, light fittings)
17. Appliance installation
18. Final clean
19. Handover
```

**Key point:** Note that painting sits at position 14, but final plumbing/electrical fit-off (tapware, cover plates) occurs AFTER painting at positions 15-16. This is a deliberate coordination decision explained in Section 6.

## 2. What Must Be Complete Before Painting Starts

Every prerequisite below must be finished before the painter arrives on site. Missing even one creates rework, delays, or a substandard finish.

### 2.1 All plastering and patching complete and sanded

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| All plasterboard joints taped, set, and sanded smooth | Paint will highlight every imperfection in the plaster surface. Ridges from unsanded joints show through paint, especially under side-lighting (common in kitchens and bathrooms with downlights). |
| Cornice / ceiling join set and sanded | An unfinished cornice line ruins the ceiling-to-wall transition. |
| All patches from plumbing/electrical penetrations filled and sanded | Rough or unfilled patches create visible blemishes. AS/NZS 2311:2017 requires a smooth, sound substrate before coating. |
| Primer/sealer applied to all new plasterboard | Bare plasterboard absorbs paint unevenly, causing "flashing" (visible differences in sheen). A dedicated plasterboard sealer is the mandatory first coat per AS/NZS 2311:2017 — three coats total required on all bare plaster surfaces. |

### 2.2 All trim, architraves, and skirting installed

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Skirting boards fixed, nail holes filled, caulked to wall | The painter needs the skirting in place to paint the skirting itself and to cut a clean wall line at the skirting junction. The caulk line between skirting and wall is painted over to create a seamless finish. |
| Architraves installed around doors and windows, caulked | Same principle — the paint covers the caulk joint between architrave and wall. Without architraves, the painter cannot finish the door/window surrounds. |
| Door frames and doors hung | Doors and frames are typically painted as part of the painting scope. They must be installed so the painter can apply enamel coats in situ. |

### 2.3 All second-fix electrical and plumbing complete

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Electrical wiring terminated behind walls (second-fix connections done) | If the electrician needs to return to pull cables or make connections in walls, they risk damaging freshly painted surfaces. All in-wall work must be done first. |
| Plumbing pipe connections behind walls complete | Same as electrical — any in-wall plumbing work must be finished before painting. |
| **Note:** Cover plates and tapware are NOT installed yet | Cover plates and tapware go on AFTER painting. See Section 6 for coordination detail. |

### 2.4 Tiling complete including grouting

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| All wall and floor tiles laid | The painter needs to see where the tile line ends and the painted surface begins to achieve a clean transition. |
| Grouting complete and dried | Grout dust is extremely fine and would contaminate wet paint. Grouting must be fully complete and the area cleaned before painting. |
| Tile edge finished (trim, bullnose, or raw edge determined) | The paint line meets the tile edge — the painter needs this junction to be in its final state. |

### 2.5 Cabinetry installed

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Kitchen/bathroom/laundry cabinets installed and secured to walls | The painter paints the walls around and above the cabinetry. Without cabinets installed, the painter cannot cut clean lines at cabinet-to-wall junctions. |
| Any cabinet scribe mouldings fitted | Scribe mouldings cover gaps between cabinets and walls — these must be in place for the painter to achieve a finished edge. |

### 2.6 Stone or laminate benchtop installed

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Benchtop templated, cut, and installed | The painter needs to see the benchtop-to-wall junction (especially at splashback areas without tiles) to paint to the correct line. |
| Splashback (if tiled) complete | Many kitchen and bathroom renovations include a tiled splashback. This must be complete so the painter can finish the wall above the tile line. |

### 2.7 All dust-generating work complete

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| No cutting, drilling, sanding, or grinding anywhere in the property | Dust travels through open doorways and via air circulation. Even work in an adjacent room can contaminate wet paint in the painting zone. |
| Site cleaned — floors swept/vacuumed, surfaces wiped | The painter will typically do a final dust-down of surfaces they are about to paint, but the site should be generally clean of construction debris. |

---

## 3. Multi-Stage Painting Approach

### 3.1 What is the multi-stage approach?

Rather than painting everything in one visit at the end, some projects split painting into two or more stages:

| Stage | Timing | What Gets Painted |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1: Prime + first coat** | After plastering/sanding is complete, BEFORE cabinetry and other installations | Walls and ceilings receive plasterboard sealer (primer) and first top coat. May be sprayed for speed. |
| **Stage 2: Final coats** | After ALL installations complete (cabinets, benchtops, skirting, etc.) | Second (and third if needed) top coats on walls/ceilings. All trim, skirting, architraves, and doors painted with enamel. |

### 3.2 When is this approach used?

**Common in new builds.** In new residential construction, the multi-stage approach is standard practice. The sequence typically follows:

1. Plasterboard is completed throughout the house.
2. Painter sprays primer and first top coat on all walls and ceilings while the space is completely empty — no cabinets, no flooring, no fixtures.
3. All fit-out trades then install their work (cabinets, flooring, trim, plumbing, electrical).
4. Painter returns for final coats, touch-ups, and trim painting.

**Less common in single-room renovations.** In a kitchen or bathroom renovation where only one room is being renovated, the multi-stage approach is less practical because:

- The room is typically small enough that painting in one visit is efficient.
- The gap between stages creates scheduling complexity for a single room.
- Most residential painters prefer to do a single mobilisation for small scopes.

**Sometimes used in larger renovation projects** (e.g., whole-house renovations, multi-room renovations) where the scale justifies the two-visit approach.

### 3.3 Benefits of the multi-stage approach

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Faster spray application** | With no cabinets, skirting, or fixtures in the way, the painter can spray walls and ceilings rapidly without masking. Spraying is significantly faster than rolling for large, unobstructed areas. |
| **Less masking required** | No need to mask off cabinets, benchtops, skirting, or fixtures during the primer/first coat stage. |
| **Better primer coverage** | Spraying primer over bare plasterboard gives more even coverage than rolling, reducing the chance of flashing (uneven sheen). |
| **Allows owner to see wall colour early** | The first coat gives the homeowner a preview of the wall colour, allowing changes before the room is fully fitted out. |

### 3.4 Drawbacks of the multi-stage approach

| Drawback | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Touch-up required after installations** | Other trades will inevitably scuff, mark, or chip the first coat during their installation work. The painter must address all of this damage during the return visit. |
| **Two mobilisations = higher cost** | The painter must visit the site twice, set up twice, and clean up twice. Some painters charge a premium for split visits. |
| **Potential colour matching issues** | If the same batch of paint is not reserved, slight colour variation between the first and final coats can occur — though this is rare with quality paints. |
| **Risk of damage from installation trades** | Cabinet installers, benchtop templaters, plumbers, and electricians may damage painted walls with tools, ladders, or materials. This damage becomes the painter's problem to fix during the return visit. |

### 3.5 Recommendation for ScopeAI

For **single-room renovations** (which is ScopeAI's MVP scope), the default approach should be **painting in a single visit at the end of the project**, after all other work is complete. This is the standard practice for Australian residential renovations at this scale.

The multi-stage approach should be mentioned as an **optional note** in the scope document — something the homeowner can discuss with their builder or painter if the project involves multiple rooms or a full home renovation.

---

## 4. Touch-Up Visit After Other Trades

### 4.1 Is a touch-up visit standard in Australian renovation practice?

**Yes, but with important nuances.**

In a well-sequenced renovation, the painter completes their full scope (all coats on walls, ceilings, trim, doors) before the final plumbing and electrical fit-off. After the painter finishes:

- The **plumber** returns to install tapware (taps, shower heads, towel rails, toilet roll holders).
- The **electrician** returns to install cover plates (power point covers, light switch covers) and light fittings.
- **Appliances** are delivered and installed (dishwashers, ovens, rangehoods).

Each of these activities carries a risk of minor damage to the fresh paintwork — scuffs from ladders, marks from tools, small chips from appliance delivery.

### 4.2 Who pays for the touch-up visit?

There are two distinct categories:

| Category | Responsibility | Who Pays |
|---|---|---|
| **Painter's own defects** (missed spots, runs, drips, uneven coverage) | 100% the painter's responsibility | Included in the painter's original quote — no additional charge. These are rectification items. |
| **Trade damage** (scuffs from other trades working after painting) | Technically the responsibility of the trade that caused the damage | In practice, this is often absorbed into the painting contract or managed by the builder. |

**In managed renovation projects** (where a builder or project manager coordinates all trades), the painting quote typically includes a **touch-up allowance** — either a fixed amount or a half-day allocation for the painter to return after all other trades are finished and address any marks or minor damage. This is common practice among experienced Australian renovation builders.

**In owner-managed renovations** (homeowner coordinating individual trades directly), the touch-up visit is less likely to be included by default. The homeowner should explicitly request a touch-up allowance when getting painting quotes.

### 4.3 What does the touch-up visit cover?

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Scuffs from appliance delivery/installation | Refrigerators, dishwashers, and ovens being manoeuvred into position commonly scuff walls and door frames. |
| Marks from electrician's ladder | Ladder contact against walls and ceilings when installing light fittings. |
| Minor chips around cover plates | Electrician's screwdriver slipping when installing cover plates can chip surrounding paint. |
| Marks from plumber's tools | Wrench marks on walls near tapware locations. |
| Caulk line touch-ups | Where the painter's caulk line between skirting/architrave and wall has been disrupted by other trades. |
| Small nail hole fills | Occasionally, carpenters or other trades punch additional fixings after painting. |

### 4.4 When does the touch-up visit happen?

```
All painting complete (walls, ceilings, trim, doors)
        |
Plumber fit-off (tapware, accessories installed)
        |
Electrician fit-off (cover plates, light fittings installed)
        |
Appliances delivered and installed
        |
  >>> PAINTER RETURNS FOR TOUCH-UP VISIT <<<
        |
Final clean
        |
Handover to homeowner
```

The touch-up visit is the **very last trade visit** before the final clean and handover. It typically takes **2-4 hours** for a single room renovation, or a **half to full day** for multi-room renovations.

### 4.5 Recommendation for ScopeAI scope documents

The scope of works should include the touch-up visit as a **standard line item** with a note like:

> "Touch-up visit after completion of plumbing fit-off, electrical fit-off, and appliance installation. Includes repair of minor scuffs, marks, and chips caused by other trades."

This sets clear expectations with the homeowner and ensures the painting quote accounts for it.

## 5. Drying Times Between Coats

### 5.1 Recoat times by paint type

Recoat time is the minimum time you must wait before applying the next coat. These times are based on standard conditions of **25 degrees C and 50% relative humidity** — the baseline used by Australian paint manufacturers.

| Paint Type | Typical Use in Renovation | Touch Dry | Recoat Time | Full Cure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Acrylic (water-based) — flat/matt** | Ceilings | 30 minutes | **1-2 hours** | 14-30 days |
| **Acrylic (water-based) — low sheen** | Walls (living areas, bedrooms) | 30 minutes | **2 hours** | 14-30 days |
| **Acrylic (water-based) — semi-gloss** | Walls (kitchens, bathrooms, laundries) | 30 minutes | **2 hours** | 14-30 days |
| **Water-based enamel (e.g., Dulux Aquanamel)** | Trim, skirting, architraves, doors, window frames | 30-60 minutes | **2-4 hours** | 7-14 days |
| **Oil-based enamel (solvent-based)** | Trim, doors (less common now, still used for high-traffic timber) | 6-8 hours | **16-24 hours** | 7-14 days |
| **Plasterboard sealer/primer** | First coat on new plasterboard | 30 minutes | **1-2 hours** | N/A (overcoated) |

**Key Australian products and their specific recoat times:**

- **Dulux Wash & Wear** (most popular interior wall paint in Australia): 2 hours recoat
- **Dulux Aquanamel** (most popular water-based enamel for trim): 2 hours recoat minimum
- **Taubmans Endure** (popular interior wall paint): 2 hours recoat at 25 degrees C / 50% RH
- **Taubmans Easycoat**: 1-2 hours recoat, 4 hours in cold or humid conditions

### 5.2 How drying times affect scheduling

| Room Type | Typical Paint System | Estimated Time (Single Painter) |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard kitchen** (walls + ceiling, trim excluded) | 1 coat sealer + 2 coats semi-gloss acrylic | 1-2 days |
| **Standard bathroom** (ceiling + any unpainted wall sections above tiles) | 1 coat sealer + 2 coats semi-gloss acrylic | 0.5-1 day |
| **Laundry** | 1 coat sealer + 2 coats semi-gloss acrylic | 0.5-1 day |
| **Living area** (standard 3m x 4m room) | 1 coat sealer + 2 coats low sheen acrylic | 1-2 days |
| **All trim/skirting/architraves per room** | 1 coat primer + 2 coats water-based enamel | 1-1.5 days (enamel recoat times are longer) |

**Scheduling pattern for a single room:**

```
Day 1 AM:   Preparation (masking, drop sheets, minor filling/sanding)
Day 1 AM:   Prime/seal new plasterboard (if applicable)
Day 1 PM:   First coat — ceilings (acrylic flat/matt)
            Wait 2 hours
Day 1 PM:   First coat — walls (acrylic low sheen or semi-gloss)

Day 2 AM:   Second coat — ceilings
Day 2 AM:   Second coat — walls
Day 2 PM:   First coat — trim, skirting, architraves (water-based enamel)
            Wait 2-4 hours
Day 2 PM:   Second coat — trim (if time allows, otherwise Day 3)

Day 3 AM:   Second coat — trim (if not completed Day 2)
Day 3 AM:   Doors — 2 coats enamel (both sides)
Day 3 PM:   Final inspection, detail touch-ups, clean-up
```

### 5.3 Temperature and humidity effects

| Condition | Effect on Drying | Practical Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Temperature below 10 degrees C** | Paint dries much more slowly. Below 5 degrees C, some paints will not form a proper film at all. | Winter mornings in southern Australian states (VIC, TAS, SA, southern NSW) can drop below 10 degrees C. Avoid painting before 9-10am on cold mornings, or use indoor heating to raise the room temperature. |
| **Temperature above 35 degrees C** | Paint dries too quickly. Brush marks and roller marks become visible because the paint skins over before it can self-level. | Common in summer across much of Australia. Avoid painting in direct sunlight. Interior rooms are usually fine if air-conditioned or well-ventilated. |
| **Humidity above 85%** | Paint cannot release moisture fast enough. Drying time doubles or triples. Risk of sagging, drips, and mould growth under the paint film. | Tropical QLD and northern NSW experience high humidity year-round. Use dehumidifiers in enclosed rooms. Check humidity with a hygrometer before starting. |
| **Humidity below 30%** | Paint dries very quickly — can cause lap marks (visible edges where wet paint overlaps dried paint). | Less common issue. Mainly in arid inland areas during summer. Work in smaller sections. |
| **Ideal conditions** | 15-25 degrees C, 40-60% humidity | Most of coastal Australia achieves these conditions in autumn (March-May) and spring (September-November). |

### 5.4 Curing vs. drying

An important distinction:

- **Dry to touch / recoat:** The paint surface is dry enough to handle or overcoat. This takes hours.
- **Full cure:** The paint has reached its maximum hardness, adhesion, and washability. This takes **7-30 days** depending on the product.

**Why this matters for renovations:**

- Freshly painted surfaces should not be scrubbed or cleaned with chemicals for at least 7 days (acrylic) or 14 days (enamel).
- Homeowners should be advised not to hang pictures, attach hooks, or lean furniture against walls for at least 2 weeks after painting.
- Appliances should not be pushed hard against freshly painted walls during the curing period.
- The scope document should include a **post-painting care note** advising the homeowner of cure times.

---

## 6. Coordination with Other Trades

Painting interacts with more trades than any other discipline in a renovation. Getting the coordination right is essential to a professional finish and efficient scheduling.

### 6.1 Electrician

The painter-electrician coordination is one of the most critical relationships in a renovation.

**Sequence:**

```
Electrical second-fix (wiring terminated behind walls, cable connections made)
        |
  Painter completes all coats
        |
Electrician returns for final fit-off (cover plates, light fittings)
```

**Cover plates (power points, light switches):**

| Detail | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Cover plates must be **OFF** during painting | The painter needs to paint the wall right up to (and slightly behind) the position where the cover plate sits. If cover plates are already installed, the painter must mask around each one — this is time-consuming and produces an inferior result with visible paint edges. |
| Who removes cover plates? | In Australia, electrical work is legally restricted. Technically, only a licensed electrician should remove and reinstall cover plates, as the plates cover conductive terminal screws. In practice, many painters remove standard snap-on cover plates themselves (no tool required), but screw-fixed plates should be left to the electrician. |
| Painter paints the wall around the electrical box | The painter ensures paint coverage extends slightly past where the cover plate will sit, so no unpainted wall is visible around the plate edges. |
| Electrician reinstalls cover plates AFTER painting | The cover plates go on over the dried, finished paint. This produces the cleanest result — a crisp edge where the plate meets the painted wall. |

**Light fittings:**

- Downlights, pendants, and wall sconces are installed by the electrician AFTER painting is complete.
- The painter paints the ceiling including the downlight holes (paint goes slightly into the hole).
- The electrician then clicks the downlight trims into place over the painted ceiling.

### 6.2 Plumber

**Sequence:**

```
Plumbing second-fix (pipe connections behind walls, waste connections)
        |
  Painter completes all coats
        |
Plumber returns for final fit-off (tapware, accessories)
```

**Tapware and fixtures:**

| Detail | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Tapware (taps, shower mixers, spouts) installed AFTER painting | Painting behind and around installed tapware is extremely difficult and produces poor results. The painter needs clean, unobstructed wall surfaces. |
| Bathroom accessories (towel rails, toilet roll holders, robe hooks) installed AFTER painting | Same principle. The wall must be fully painted before accessories are fixed in place. |
| Toilet installed AFTER painting (where possible) | Painting behind a toilet is notoriously difficult. If the toilet can be left out until after painting, the result is far superior. In renovations where the toilet must remain functional during works, this may not be possible. |
| Tapware mounting points may need specific preparation | If tapware is being surface-mounted (not recessed into tiles), the painter should be aware of mounting locations so they do not fill or paint over pilot holes left by the plumber. |

### 6.3 Tiler

**Sequence:**

```
Tiling complete (all tiles laid and grouted, grout dried and cleaned)
        |
  Painter completes all coats
```

**Paint line meets tile line:**

| Detail | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Who is responsible for the junction? | The **painter** is responsible for cutting a clean paint line where the painted wall meets the tile edge. This is one of the most visible junctions in a kitchen or bathroom. |
| How is the junction finished? | The typical approach in Australian renovations: (1) The tiler finishes their tiles to a defined edge (often with a tile trim strip, or a bullnose tile, or a raw cut edge). (2) Any gap between the last tile and the plaster wall is filled with **paintable acrylic caulk** (not silicone — silicone cannot be painted). (3) The painter then paints the wall down to the tile edge, covering the caulk to create a seamless line. |
| Silicone vs. paintable caulk | **Critical distinction.** Silicone sealant (used by tilers and plumbers in wet areas) **cannot be painted over** — paint will not adhere to silicone. Any junction that needs to be painted must use a **paintable acrylic or latex caulk**. The tiler and painter need to coordinate on which product is used at visible junctions. |
| Above-tile wall areas | In bathrooms and kitchen splashbacks, the wall above the tile line is the painter's domain. The painter must achieve a clean, straight line at the top of the tiles. Using painter's tape along the tile edge is standard practice. |

### 6.4 Carpenter (Skirting, Architraves, Doors)

**Sequence:**

```
Carpenter installs skirting boards, architraves, door frames, doors
        |
Carpenter fills nail holes, caulks gaps between trim and walls
        |
  Painter paints trim and surrounding walls
```

**Skirting boards and architraves — painted before or after installation?**

| Approach | When Used | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-paint (primer + 1 coat) BEFORE installation, then final coat AFTER** | Common in new builds and larger renovations. Pre-primed MDF skirting/architrave is increasingly standard in Australia (e.g., from Intrim Mouldings, Porta, HMR ranges). | Faster — large quantities can be laid on trestles and rolled/sprayed efficiently. Less bending down. Better coverage on all faces (including back — important for moisture protection of MDF). | Requires touch-up after installation. Nail holes, caulk lines, and any transport/installation damage must be addressed in the final coat. |
| **Paint entirely AFTER installation** | Common in single-room renovations where trim quantities are small. | One mobilisation for the painter. No risk of damage during installation negating earlier work. Painter sees every junction in its final state. | Slower — painter must work around installed trim, cutting in at floor level. More masking required. Back of skirting/architrave remains uncoated (risk of moisture absorption for MDF, though not visible). |

**Australian common practice for renovations:** In single-room renovations (ScopeAI's target), the most common approach is to purchase **pre-primed skirting and architrave** (factory primer already applied), install them, fill nail holes, caulk the wall junction, then the painter applies **two coats of water-based enamel** over the pre-primed surface. This hybrid approach gets the benefit of factory priming without requiring a separate pre-painting visit.

**Doors:**

- Internal doors in Australian renovations are typically purchased **pre-primed** (e.g., Hume Doors, Corinthian Doors).
- The painter applies 2 coats of water-based enamel to all faces and edges after the door is hung.
- Door edges must be painted to seal the door against moisture — AS/NZS 2311:2017 notes that all faces (including top and bottom edges) should be coated.
- The painter typically paints doors in situ (on their hinges), propping them open and painting one side at a time to allow drying between sides.

## 7. Seasonal and Climate Considerations

### 7.1 Winter painting (June-August)

**Interior painting in winter is actually advantageous in most of Australia.**

| Factor | Winter Reality |
|---|---|
| **Humidity** | Generally lower than summer in most Australian climate zones (except tropical QLD). Lower humidity = faster drying, better paint film formation. |
| **Temperature** | Can be challenging in VIC, TAS, and highland areas where morning temperatures drop below 10 degrees C. Solution: start later in the morning (after 9-10am) or use indoor heating to warm the room above 15 degrees C before painting. |
| **Painter availability** | Winter is off-peak for painting. Painters may have shorter wait times and some offer discounted rates. |
| **Ventilation** | Windows can be opened for ventilation without the extreme heat or humidity that summer brings. |
| **UV exposure** | Not a factor for interior painting. |

**Winter precautions:**
- Do not apply paint when the surface temperature is below 10 degrees C. Use an infrared thermometer to check wall surface temperature, not just air temperature.
- Avoid late afternoon application of enamel paints — dew formation overnight on uncured enamel can cause blooming (milky appearance).
- Allow 50-100% longer recoat times on cold days (e.g., 4 hours instead of 2 hours for acrylic).

### 7.2 Summer painting (December-February)

| Factor | Summer Reality |
|---|---|
| **Heat** | Temperatures above 35 degrees C cause paint to dry too fast, leading to brush marks, roller marks, and poor self-levelling. Interior rooms with air conditioning are generally fine. |
| **Humidity** | Northern and coastal regions experience very high humidity (80%+). This significantly slows drying and risks adhesion failure. Use dehumidifiers in enclosed rooms. |
| **Painter availability** | Peak season — painters may have longer lead times (2-4 weeks wait). |
| **Ventilation** | Opening windows in humid conditions can actually introduce more moisture. In air-conditioned rooms, keep windows closed and rely on the AC to control temperature and humidity. |

**Summer precautions:**
- Never paint exterior surfaces in direct sunlight above 30 degrees C.
- For interior work, maintain room temperature below 30 degrees C using air conditioning.
- In tropical regions (QLD, NT, northern WA), check humidity before starting — if above 85%, delay painting.

### 7.3 Optimal seasons

| Season | Interior Painting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Autumn (March-May)** | Excellent | Mild temperatures, moderate humidity, reducing towards winter. Widely considered the best season for painting across most of Australia. |
| **Spring (September-November)** | Excellent | Similar to autumn — mild temperatures, moderate humidity. Slightly higher rainfall risk in some regions. |
| **Winter (June-August)** | Good (with precautions) | Excellent in QLD, northern NSW, WA. Requires care in VIC, TAS, SA (cold mornings). Interior painting is generally fine. |
| **Summer (December-February)** | Acceptable (with precautions) | Fine in southern states if air-conditioned. Challenging in tropical north due to humidity. |
