# Painting in Australian Residential Renovations
## Section 6: Common Exclusions

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Reference document for AI scope-of-works generator for homeowners renovating kitchens, bathrooms, laundries, living areas, and outdoor spaces in Australia.
**Confidence:** High (sourced from Australian trade publications, painting industry bodies, regulatory standards, and renovation specialists). Some items draw on general industry practice where Australia-specific published guidance is limited.

## Scope Impact: Why Clear Exclusions Prevent Disputes

Ambiguity about inclusions and exclusions is one of the most common sources of building disputes in Australia, often resulting in expensive tribunal claims at NCAT (NSW), VCAT (VIC), or QCAT (QLD). The painting trade is particularly vulnerable to scope disputes because homeowners routinely assume work is included that the painter considers outside their brief.

A comprehensive schedule of inclusions and exclusions, properly incorporated into a building contract, provides clear legal protection and prevents "he said, she said" disputes. Vague descriptions like "all necessary painting works" provide no legal protection and should never appear in a scope document.

**Every exclusion listed below should be explicitly stated in the scope-of-works document.** Even if something seems obvious (e.g., "we are not painting the roof"), naming it removes ambiguity. The cost of listing an exclusion is zero. The cost of a dispute over an unstated assumption can be thousands of dollars and weeks of delay.

## 6.1 Paint Supply

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The supply of paint, primer, undercoat, sealers, and sundries (brushes, rollers, drop sheets, tape, caulk, filler) required for the job. |
| **Why it may be excluded** | Some painters quote labour-only, expecting the homeowner to purchase paint separately. This is more common with budget-oriented or day-rate painters. It can also occur when the homeowner has a strong preference for a specific brand or colour and wants to purchase directly. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | In Australian renovation practice, the **standard and most common approach is "supply and apply"** — the painter supplies all paint and materials as part of the quoted price. Paint and supplies typically represent 15-25% of the total job cost. Painters generally prefer to supply their own materials because they purchase at trade pricing (significant discount off RRP) and the margin on materials contributes to their profit. Labour-only quotes are less common and usually result in higher labour charges to compensate. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope must explicitly state whether paint is painter-supplied or owner-supplied. If painter-supplied, it should specify the brand, product line, finish (e.g., Dulux Wash & Wear Low Sheen), and number of coats. If owner-supplied, the scope should note that the painter accepts no responsibility for product performance or coverage issues. |

**Australian context:** When requesting quotes, homeowners can ask for two versions — one supply-and-apply, one labour-only — to compare. However, the supply-and-apply model is strongly favoured because it simplifies accountability: if the paint fails, one party is responsible.

## 6.2 Wallpaper Removal

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Stripping existing wallpaper from walls before painting, including removal of adhesive residue, and preparing the bare substrate for paint. May involve steaming, chemical strippers, scraping, and wall washing. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Wallpaper removal is time-consuming, unpredictable, and can reveal hidden wall damage underneath (water damage, crumbling plaster, uneven surfaces). The time required varies enormously depending on wallpaper type (vinyl-coated vs paper, single layer vs multiple layers) and how well it was originally adhered. A painter cannot accurately price the painting until they know what condition the walls are in underneath. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | In Australian renovation practice, **wallpaper removal sits at the boundary between demolition and painting**. The industry convention is: (1) If a demolition contractor is already on site for other strip-out work, wallpaper removal is typically included in the demolition scope. (2) If there is no demolition contractor, the painter may offer wallpaper removal as a **separate line item** at an additional cost, not included in the standard painting price. (3) Some homeowners DIY the wallpaper removal to save cost. The key principle is that wallpaper removal is **never assumed to be included** in a standard painting quote unless explicitly stated. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope must state either "Wallpaper removal is included (specify rooms)" or "Wallpaper removal is excluded — walls to be presented wallpaper-free and in a paintable condition before painting commences." If the painter is doing removal, it should be a separate priced line item because it cannot be accurately estimated alongside painting. |

## 6.3 Plastering and Patching Beyond Minor Fill Work

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Repairing wall and ceiling surfaces before painting. This ranges from filling tiny nail holes to replacing entire sheets of plasterboard. The critical question is: what counts as "minor" (painter's responsibility) versus "major" (plasterer required)? |
| **Why it's excluded** | Painters are trained to do light surface preparation — they are not plasterers. Major plaster repair requires different skills, tools, and materials. If a painter attempts significant plaster repair, the result is often visible under paint (especially in raking light). A plasterer delivers a Level 4 or Level 5 finish that a painter cannot replicate. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | The Australian industry draws the line as follows: |

### What the Painter Handles (Included in Standard Scope)

- Nail holes and small screw holes (up to ~5mm diameter)
- Hairline cracks (less than ~2mm wide)
- Minor dents and scratches in plasterboard where the paper face is intact
- Light sanding of previously painted surfaces
- Filling gaps between architraves/skirting and walls with caulk
- Spot-priming filled areas before topcoating

### What Requires a Plasterer (Excluded from Painting Scope)

- Holes larger than approximately 50mm (fist-sized or larger)
- Cracks wider than ~2mm or structural cracking (indicates movement)
- Water-damaged plasterboard (swollen, bubbled, or delaminating)
- Areas where the plasterboard core is compromised (soft, crumbly, or flexing when pressed)
- New plasterboard installation (after wall modifications, niche creation, etc.)
- Joining and finishing new plasterboard sheets (tape, bed, and finish coats)
- Skim coating entire walls to achieve a smooth finish
- Cornice replacement or repair
- Repairing textured or patterned plaster finishes

| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state: "Includes minor patching (nail holes, hairline cracks, small dents up to 50mm). Excludes plastering, skim coating, plasterboard replacement, cornice repair, or repair of water-damaged surfaces. Walls and ceilings to be presented in a sound, plastered condition suitable for painting." |

**Australian context:** The Australian Standard AS/NZS 2311:2017 (Guide to the Painting of Buildings) addresses surface preparation requirements. Dulux and other major manufacturers define plasterboard finish levels (Level 1-5), with Level 4 being standard for residential painting and Level 5 for high-gloss or critical lighting conditions. The painter is responsible for preparing a Level 4+ surface for painting, but the plasterer is responsible for delivering that Level 4+ substrate in the first place.

## 6.4 Feature Walls Requiring Special Techniques

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Decorative wall finishes that go beyond standard brush/roller paint application. Includes limewash, venetian plaster, micro-cement, suede finishes, textured coatings, metallic finishes, faux finishes, and ombre/colour-wash effects. |
| **Why it's excluded** | These finishes require specialist training, specialist tools (steel trowels, specific application techniques), and often specialist products that differ from standard architectural paint. Venetian plaster, for example, involves multiple hand-troweled layers of lime-based plaster and polishing — it is an entirely different trade process. Even limewash, while simpler to apply, uses different products and produces a finish that cannot be touched up like standard paint. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Venetian plaster and micro-cement:** Specialist applicator (not a standard painter). Costs $150-$200+ per square metre for supply and installation in Australia. These tradespeople are typically rendering specialists or decorative plasterers, not painters. **Limewash:** Can be applied by a standard painter but uses different products (lime-based, not acrylic). Should be quoted as a separate line item at approximately $20/sqm for application. **Suede, metallic, textured finishes:** Some experienced painters offer these, but they should be quoted separately with a sample/test patch. Standard painting rates do not apply. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state: "Standard paint application only (brush, roller, or spray). Excludes decorative finishes including but not limited to venetian plaster, limewash, micro-cement, suede, metallic, textured, or faux finishes. Feature walls requiring specialist finishes to be quoted separately." |

## 6.5 Exterior Painting (When Scope Is Interior Only)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Any painting of external surfaces including weatherboards, rendered walls, fascia, soffits, gutters, downpipes, window frames (exterior side), doors (exterior side), fence lines, retaining walls, pergolas, or carports. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Interior and exterior painting are fundamentally different scopes. Exterior painting requires weather-resistant products (exterior-grade acrylic or oil-based systems), different preparation (pressure washing, scraping of peeling paint, mould treatment for exposed surfaces), and is affected by weather conditions and access requirements. Many renovation projects only involve interior spaces. If the scope is interior-only, exterior work must be explicitly excluded to prevent disputes about painting the "outside of the window" or "front door exterior." |
| **Who is typically responsible** | The same painter can do both interior and exterior, but they are quoted and scoped as separate projects. Exterior painting is its own scope document with its own inclusions, exclusions, preparation requirements, and product specifications. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state: "This scope covers interior surfaces only. All exterior painting — including but not limited to external walls, fascia, soffits, gutters, window frames (exterior face), door exteriors, fences, and outbuildings — is excluded." This is especially important when the renovation involves a room with an exterior wall (e.g., kitchen with an external window). |

## 6.6 Painting Areas Not Being Renovated

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Rooms, hallways, corridors, or areas adjacent to or connected to the renovation zone that are not part of the renovation project. For example, the hallway connecting to a kitchen being renovated, or the bedroom adjacent to a bathroom renovation. |
| **Why it's excluded** | A renovation painting scope covers only the surfaces within the defined renovation zone. Adjacent areas may need painting eventually (especially for colour matching), but they are not part of the current project. Including them without explicit agreement inflates the scope and cost. Conversely, a homeowner may expect the painter to "touch up" the hallway because it connects to the kitchen — this must be addressed upfront. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | The homeowner decides whether to add adjacent areas. The painter should flag that colour matching between freshly painted renovation areas and untouched adjacent areas may be noticeable, especially with white or light colours that yellow over time. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state: "Painting is limited to [specific room/area]. Adjacent rooms, hallways, ceilings outside the renovation zone, and common areas are excluded. Touch-up painting to adjacent areas (e.g., where new work meets existing finishes) can be quoted as an additional item." |

---

## 6.7 Furniture Moving and Storage

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Moving, covering, protecting, or storing furniture and belongings in the rooms being painted. Includes shifting large items away from walls, covering with drop sheets, and replacing after painting is complete. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Most painters expect rooms to be cleared or substantially cleared before they arrive. Moving heavy furniture (wardrobes, beds, entertainment units) is time-consuming, creates liability for damage, and is outside the painter's insurance coverage in most cases. Professional painters will move small items and protect fixed items with drop sheets, but they will not be responsible for emptying a room. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **The homeowner** is responsible for removing or relocating furniture and belongings before the painter starts. In a renovation context, the room is often already stripped during demolition, so this is less of an issue. For painting-only projects (e.g., repaint of a living area not undergoing structural renovation), the homeowner must clear the space. Some painters offer furniture moving as an **additional paid service**, but this is not standard. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes.** The scope should state: "Homeowner to clear rooms of furniture, wall hangings, and personal belongings before painting commences. Painter will protect fixed items and flooring with drop sheets. Painter accepts no liability for items left in the work area." |

## 6.8 Colour Consulting / Colour Selection

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The process of choosing paint colours, creating colour schemes, coordinating colours with finishes (benchtops, splashbacks, flooring), and specifying exact product codes for the painter to apply. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Painters apply paint — they do not typically advise on colour selection beyond basic suggestions. Colour consulting is a separate professional service offered by colour consultants, interior designers, or paint brand consultants (e.g., Dulux Colour Consultants, Porter's Paints on-site colourists). Getting colour wrong is costly (repainting) and emotionally charged. Painters do not want to be responsible for a homeowner's colour dissatisfaction. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **The homeowner** selects colours, either independently, via an interior designer, or using a colour consulting service. In Australia, Dulux, Haymes, and Porter's Paints all offer paid colour consulting services (typically $200-$400 per session for in-home consultations in metro areas). Some painting companies offer basic colour advice as a value-add, but this is informal and not a professional colour consultation. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes.** The scope should state: "Colour selection is the homeowner's responsibility. All colours and finish types (gloss level) must be confirmed in writing before painting commences. Colour consulting services are not included. The painter will apply sample patches for homeowner approval before proceeding with full application." |

## 6.9 Specialty Coatings

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Coatings that serve a functional purpose beyond decoration. Includes anti-graffiti coatings, intumescent (fire-retardant) coatings, acoustic coatings, anti-bacterial coatings, epoxy floor coatings, chemical-resistant coatings, and anti-condensation coatings. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Specialty coatings require specific products, application methods, and often trade certifications. For example, intumescent fire-retardant coatings must be applied by approved applicators who hold specific product certifications — an uncertified application may void the fire rating. Epoxy floor coatings require floor grinding, moisture testing, and multi-stage application that is fundamentally different from wall/ceiling painting. These are specialist trades within the broader coatings industry. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Specialist coating applicators**, not standard residential painters. In Australia, companies like McNaught Group, A&I Coatings, and Durable Concrete Coatings provide these services. Standard residential painters typically do not carry the products, equipment, or certifications for specialty coatings. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes.** The scope should state: "Standard interior architectural paint only. Excludes specialty coatings including but not limited to epoxy floor coatings, fire-retardant (intumescent) coatings, anti-graffiti coatings, acoustic coatings, anti-bacterial coatings, and chemical-resistant finishes. These require specialist applicators and are quoted separately." |

## 6.10 Timber Staining and Oiling

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Applying stain, oil, varnish, or polyurethane to timber surfaces including decks, exposed beams, timber window frames, timber floors, stairs, handrails, and built-in timber shelving. This is a different product system and application process to standard wall/ceiling paint. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Timber finishing uses fundamentally different products (oils, stains, polyurethanes, marine varnishes) rather than acrylic architectural paint. The preparation is different (sanding timber vs filling/caulking plaster). The application technique is different (often multiple thin coats with sanding between coats). Timber floors in particular require floor sanding specialists with drum sanders and edge sanders — a painter with a brush is not the right trade. Decks require their own products (e.g., Sikkens Cetol Deck, Intergrain UltraDeck) formulated for exterior timber and foot traffic. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Timber floors:** Floor sanding and polishing specialists (separate trade entirely). Costs $20-$80/sqm depending on sanding, staining, and coating requirements. **Decks:** Deck restoration specialists or experienced painters with deck-specific products. Costs $20-$50/sqm. **Exposed beams, handrails, timber joinery:** Can be done by the painter as a separate line item with timber-specific products, but it is not included in a standard painting scope. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state: "Excludes staining, oiling, varnishing, or polyurethane coating of timber surfaces including but not limited to timber floors, decks, exposed beams, handrails, stairs, and timber window/door frames. Timber finishing to be quoted separately or by a timber finishing specialist." |

## 6.11 Scaffolding

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Temporary elevated work platforms required for painting high areas — stairwell walls, double-height ceilings, vaulted ceilings, high external walls, or areas inaccessible by standard extension ladders. Includes scaffold erection, certification, hire period, and dismantling. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Scaffolding is a significant cost item that can range from $500 for a small internal tower to $5,000+ for full external scaffolding on a multi-storey home. It requires a licensed scaffolder to erect (for heights over 4 metres in most Australian states), inspection and certification before use, and a hire period that covers the painting duration. This cost is unpredictable and project-specific. Most standard interior renovation painting (single-storey rooms) does not require scaffolding — step ladders and extension ladders are sufficient. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **It depends on the arrangement:** (1) Some painters include scaffolding in their quote and manage the scaffolding hire themselves — this is more common for painting-specific projects. (2) On larger renovation projects with a builder/project manager, scaffolding is often a **principal-supplied item** (the builder organises and pays for scaffolding, and all trades share it). (3) In some cases, the homeowner hires scaffolding directly. The scope must make clear who is responsible for supply, erection, certification, hire costs, and dismantling. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state either: "Scaffolding is included in this quote for [specific areas]" or "Scaffolding is excluded. If scaffolding is required for high areas (e.g., stairwells, vaulted ceilings), this will be quoted separately or provided by the principal contractor." For standard single-storey interior renovation rooms, scaffolding is almost never required and a simple note of "Access via step ladders and extension ladders included" is sufficient. |

## 6.12 Lead Paint Testing and Abatement

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Testing painted surfaces for lead content and, if detected, safely removing or encapsulating lead-containing paint in compliance with Australian safety standards. Lead-based paint was commonly used in Australian homes built **before 1970** (high lead content) and may be present in homes built up to the **mid-1980s** (lower concentrations). It is estimated that approximately **3.7 million Australian homes** built before 1970 contain lead paint, often at concentrations up to 50%. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Lead paint management is a regulated safety matter governed by AS/NZS 4361.2:2017 (Guide to Hazardous Paint Management — Residential, Public and Commercial Buildings) and state/territory WHS regulations. Disturbing lead paint through sanding, scraping, or heat stripping creates toxic lead dust that poses serious health risks, particularly to children and pregnant women. A standard painter is not licensed or equipped for lead abatement. The training unit CPCCPD3031 ("Work safely with lead-painted surfaces in the painting industry") is available but not universally held by all painters. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Testing:** Should be arranged by the homeowner or builder before any painting work begins on pre-1970 homes. Lead test kits are available at hardware stores for basic screening, but laboratory analysis of paint chip samples is more reliable. Professional lead paint inspectors (e.g., SESA Environmental) provide comprehensive assessments. **Abatement:** If lead paint is confirmed and must be disturbed, a licensed lead abatement contractor handles removal using wet methods, HEPA-filtered equipment, and controlled waste disposal. If lead paint is present but intact and will simply be painted over (encapsulation), a painter can do this — but must not sand, scrape, or disturb the existing surface. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always — especially for pre-1970 homes.** The scope should state: "This scope assumes all surfaces are free of lead-based paint. For homes built before 1970, lead paint testing is recommended before work commences and is the homeowner's responsibility. If lead paint is detected, lead abatement by a licensed specialist is required before standard painting can proceed. Lead paint testing and abatement are excluded from this scope." |

## 6.13 Mould Treatment (Beyond Standard Wash)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Treatment of mould-affected surfaces before painting. Standard painting preparation includes a light wash with sugar soap or a mild bleach solution to remove surface dust and minor mildew. **This exclusion covers significant mould contamination** — black mould (Stachybotrys), widespread mould growth, mould penetrating into plasterboard or timber, or mould caused by ongoing moisture ingress (leaks, rising damp, condensation). |
| **Why it's excluded** | Painting over mould does not kill it. The mould will continue growing underneath the paint, eventually causing bubbling, peeling, and discolouration. Significant mould indicates a **moisture source** that must be resolved first (leaking pipes, failed waterproofing, inadequate ventilation). A painter is not qualified to diagnose or fix the underlying moisture problem, and they should not be painting over active mould growth. Black mould in particular can pose serious health risks and may require professional remediation with HEPA filtration and protective equipment. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Minor surface mildew:** The painter handles this as part of standard wash-down preparation. **Significant mould:** (1) The underlying moisture source must be identified and fixed by the relevant trade (plumber for leaks, waterproofer for failed membranes, builder for ventilation). (2) Professional mould remediation specialists (e.g., Mould Men, The Mould Doctor) treat the mould contamination. (3) Only then can the painter proceed. Queensland's WorkSafe guidance specifically addresses workplace mould management obligations. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes.** The scope should state: "Includes standard surface wash (sugar soap/mould wash) as part of preparation. Excludes professional mould remediation, treatment of black mould, or painting over active mould growth. If significant mould is discovered during preparation, work will stop and the homeowner will be notified. The moisture source must be resolved and mould professionally treated before painting can proceed." |

## 6.14 Ceiling Texture Removal (Stipple / Popcorn Ceiling)

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Removal of textured ceiling finishes — commonly known as "popcorn," "stipple," or "vermiculite" ceilings — that were popular in Australian homes built between the 1950s and 1990s. Removal involves scraping, sanding, or resurfacing the ceiling to achieve a smooth, modern finish before painting. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Ceiling texture removal is a **plastering/ceiling specialist** task, not a painting task. Methods include wet scraping, dry scraping, or ceiling resurfacing (overlaying with a new smooth surface). The process creates significant mess and dust. Critically, some textured ceilings in pre-1990 homes may contain **asbestos** — particularly vermiculite-based textures. Disturbing asbestos-containing material without testing is illegal in all Australian states and territories. Even non-asbestos textured ceilings require plastering skills to achieve a smooth, paint-ready finish after removal. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Ceiling resurfacing specialists or plasterers.** In Australia, companies like Ceiling Resurfacing Australia specialise in this work. The process typically takes 2-4 days depending on area size. After removal/resurfacing, the ceiling must be finished to a paintable standard (Level 4 minimum) by the plasterer before the painter commences. **Asbestos testing** must be done before any textured ceiling is disturbed — this is the homeowner's or builder's responsibility, not the painter's or plasterer's. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, always.** The scope should state: "Excludes removal of textured, stipple, or popcorn ceilings. Ceilings to be presented in a smooth, plastered condition suitable for painting. If textured ceilings are present, removal and resurfacing by a ceiling specialist or plasterer is required before painting. Asbestos testing of textured ceilings built before 1990 is the homeowner's responsibility." |

## 6.15 Roof Painting

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Painting or coating the roof of a building, including metal roofing (Colorbond), tiled roofs (concrete or terracotta), and flat roofing membranes. Roof painting involves high-pressure cleaning, rust treatment (for metal), primer application, and specialist roof coatings. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Roof painting is an entirely separate trade specialisation. It requires working at height (scaffolding and/or harness systems), specialist roof coatings (not standard architectural paint), high-pressure cleaning equipment, and knowledge of different roof substrates. Roof painters typically hold additional safety certifications for working at heights. The products used (e.g., roof membrane coatings, heat-reflective coatings) are fundamentally different from interior wall paint. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Specialist roof painting contractors.** Many roof painters also offer roof restoration services (repointing tiles, replacing broken tiles, treating rust). This is a standalone trade that is never part of an interior renovation painting scope. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes, if there is any possibility of confusion.** For interior renovation scopes, a brief statement is sufficient: "Excludes all roof painting, roof coating, and roof restoration." This may seem obvious, but naming it removes any ambiguity, especially on projects where the homeowner is getting multiple areas of work done simultaneously. |

## 6.16 Garage Floor Painting / Coating

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Applying epoxy, polyurethane, or specialist floor coatings to garage floors, carport slabs, or other concrete floor areas. This includes surface grinding/preparation, moisture testing of the concrete slab, primer application, and multi-coat epoxy or polyurethane systems, often with decorative flake or non-slip additives. |
| **Why it's excluded** | Garage floor coating is a specialist concrete coating trade, not standard painting. The process requires diamond grinding equipment to profile the concrete surface, moisture testing (excess slab moisture causes coating failure), and multi-component chemical coatings (two-pack epoxy, polyurethane) that are mixed and applied differently from standard paint. The products, equipment, application method, and trade skills are all different from residential interior painting. |
| **Who is typically responsible** | **Specialist floor coating contractors.** In Australia, companies like Durable Concrete Coatings, Sydney Epoxy, and Brisbane Epoxy Floors specialise in this work. Standard residential painters do not carry the grinding equipment or epoxy products required. Some painters offer basic concrete floor paint (single-pack floor paint), but this is a significantly inferior product compared to proper epoxy systems and should not be confused with professional floor coatings. |
| **Should it be called out?** | **Yes.** The scope should state: "Excludes garage floor, carport floor, or any concrete floor painting/coating. Floor coatings (epoxy, polyurethane) require a specialist floor coating contractor." |
