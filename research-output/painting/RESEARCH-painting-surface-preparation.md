## 1. Why Preparation Matters

Surface preparation accounts for approximately 70% of a quality paint job. The Australian Standard AS/NZS 2311:2017 (Guide to the Painting of Buildings) is the recognised industry standard and mandates that surface preparation and coating application are skilled activities requiring qualified personnel.

**Key principle:** Paint is only as good as the surface it is applied to. Poor preparation is the number one cause of paint failure (peeling, blistering, cracking, poor coverage). Preparation typically represents 40-50% of the total painting budget and a proportional amount of labour time.

## 2. New Plasterboard

### 2.1 Plasterboard Finish Levels (AS/NZS 2589:2017)

Before a painter touches new plasterboard, the plasterer must achieve the specified finish level. This affects what the painter needs to do.

| Level | Description | Use Case | Jointing System | Painter Prep Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Level 3** | Minimum finish, not decorated | Above ceilings, service shafts | 2 coats over tape + fasteners | None (not painted) |
| **Level 4** | Standard residential finish | General walls and ceilings, flat/low sheen paint | 3 coats (tape + 2 additional) over joints and fasteners, sanded smooth | Sealer/undercoat + 2 topcoats |
| **Level 5** | Premium finish | Semi-gloss/gloss paint, dark colours, critical lighting, feature walls | Level 4 + skim coat (specialty product or plaster) | Primer/surfacer + sealer/undercoat + 2 topcoats |

**Important:** A Level 4 finish with a skim coat applied after the fact is NOT equivalent to a true Level 5 finish. Level 5 must be specified at design stage and requires tighter framing tolerances (3mm over 1.8m for 90% of area vs 4mm for Level 4).

### 2.2 Step-by-Step Preparation -- Level 4 (Standard Residential)

1. **Inspect** -- Ensure all joints are smooth, free of tool marks and ridges, fastener heads covered
2. **Dust down** -- Remove all plaster dust with a soft brush or vacuum
3. **Spot-seal** -- Seal any exposed paper edges or scuffed areas with a sealer/binder if needed
4. **Apply sealer/primer coat** -- One full coat of acrylic sealer undercoat (ASU) or primer/sealer/undercoat (PSU)
5. **Dry** -- Allow minimum 2 hours drying (longer in cold or humid conditions)
6. **De-nib sand** -- Light sand with 220-grit sandpaper to remove dust nibs and imperfections
7. **Dust down** -- Remove sanding dust with a tack cloth or damp cloth
8. **Apply first topcoat** -- Full coat of selected topcoat by brush, roller, or spray (back-roll if sprayed)
9. **Dry** -- Allow full drying per manufacturer recommendation (typically 2-4 hours)
10. **De-nib sand** -- Light sand with 220-320 grit between coats
11. **Dust down** -- Clean surface again
12. **Apply second topcoat** -- Final coat applied

**Total coats on new plasterboard: 3 (1 sealer + 2 topcoats)**

This is the minimum per AS/NZS 2311:2017. Three coats must be applied to any bare plaster surface.

### 2.3 Step-by-Step Preparation -- Level 5 (Premium)

1. Steps 1-2 as above
2. **Apply primer/surfacer** -- Specialty high-build product (e.g., Dulux Professional FastFinish Level 5 Prep Coat) applied by spray or roller at high film thickness
3. **Dry thoroughly** -- As per manufacturer specification
4. **Fine sand** -- Detailed sanding of entire surface with ultra-fine sandpaper (320+ grit)
5. **Dust down**
6. **Apply sealer/undercoat** -- One coat of ASU/PSU
7. **De-nib sand and dust down**
8. **Apply two topcoats** -- With de-nib sanding and dust-down between coats

**Total coats on Level 5 plasterboard: 4 (1 primer/surfacer + 1 sealer + 2 topcoats)**

### 2.4 Products -- New Plasterboard

| Product | Manufacturer | Type | Use | Coverage |
|---------|-------------|------|-----|----------|
| **Dulux 1Step Prep (Water Based)** | Dulux | Acrylic PSU | General sealer for plasterboard, timber, masonry | ~16 m2/L |
| **Dulux Prepcoat Acrylic Sealer Undercoat (Ultrasmooth)** | Dulux | ASU | Premium sealer/undercoat for plasterboard, excellent sanding | ~12 m2/L |
| **Dulux Professional FastFinish Level 5 Prep Coat** | Dulux | Specialty surfacer | Level 5 plasterboard only, high-build, sandable | Per spec |
| **Dulux Precision Sealer Binder** | Dulux | Oil-based sealer | Sealing porous/powdery bare plaster | Per spec |
| **Taubmans 3 in 1** | Taubmans | PSU | General primer/sealer/undercoat for plasterboard and timber | ~16 m2/L (10 m2/L on new plasterboard) |
| **Haymes Elite Tricoat PSU** | Haymes | PSU | Multi-surface primer/sealer/undercoat | Per spec |

### 2.5 Sanding Between Coats on Plasterboard

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is sanding between coats standard? | Yes -- "de-nib" sanding is standard practice |
| What grit? | 220-320 grit (ultra-fine) |
| Why? | Remove dust nibs, foreign particles, roller stipple; improves adhesion and finish smoothness |
| Is it mandatory? | Not strictly for flat/low sheen finishes on Level 4, but professional standard. Essential for semi-gloss/gloss and Level 5 |
| Cleanup after sanding? | Tack cloth or barely damp cloth to remove all dust before next coat |

### 2.6 Time/Cost Implications -- New Plasterboard

- Standard Level 4 system (1 sealer + 2 topcoats): Minimum 1 day per room (drying time between coats)
- Level 5 system adds approximately 30-50% more labour due to additional coating and sanding
- Second coat of sealer may be needed where paper-face and jointing compound textures differ significantly
- De-nib sanding adds approximately 15-20 minutes per coat per room

### 2.7 Common Shortcuts on New Plasterboard

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Skipping the sealer coat | Topcoat soaks unevenly into paper vs joint compound, causing "flashing" (visible joint lines through paint) |
| Using cheap/thin sealer | Does not equalise porosity; joint lines show through topcoat |
| Only one topcoat | Insufficient opacity and uneven coverage, especially with deeper colours |
| Skipping de-nib sanding | Dust nibs and roller marks visible in finished surface, especially under side lighting |
| Using semi-gloss on Level 4 finish | Highlights every imperfection; Level 5 finish is required for semi-gloss or gloss |

---

## 3. Existing Painted Surfaces -- Good Condition

"Good condition" means the existing paint is firmly adhered, not peeling/flaking, not chalking excessively, and is generally sound. The surface may have minor scuff marks, nail holes, or accumulated grime.

### 3.1 Step-by-Step Preparation

1. **Inspect** -- Check adhesion by pressing masking tape firmly onto surface and pulling sharply. If paint comes off, treat as poor condition (Section 4)
2. **Remove fixtures** -- Remove switch plates, power point covers, light fittings, curtain hardware
3. **Wash with sugar soap** -- Dilute 1/2 cup Selleys Sugar Soap Original into 10L warm water. Wipe all surfaces top to bottom with a soft cloth, wrung out. Replace solution when murky
4. **Rinse** -- Wipe down with clean water and clean cloth to remove sugar soap residue
5. **Dry** -- Allow surface to dry completely (minimum 30 minutes for water-based paint, 2 hours for oil-based)
6. **Fill minor imperfections** -- Small nail holes, dents, hairline cracks with appropriate filler (see Section 8)
7. **Allow filler to dry** -- Typically 30 minutes for rapid fillers
8. **Sand** -- Light scuff-sand entire surface with 180-220 grit sandpaper. Sand filler patches smooth and flush
9. **Dust down** -- Tack cloth or damp cloth to remove all sanding dust
10. **Spot-prime** -- Prime any bare patches, filler spots, or stained areas with a coat of sealer/undercoat
11. **Apply topcoats** -- Two coats of selected topcoat

### 3.2 Number of Coats -- Existing Good Surfaces

| Scenario | Coats Required |
|----------|---------------|
| Same colour, same sheen, good condition | 2 topcoats (no sealer needed unless bare patches) |
| Different colour (similar tone) | 2 topcoats |
| Dramatically different colour (e.g., dark to light) | 1 tinted sealer/undercoat + 2 topcoats |
| Different sheen (e.g., flat to semi-gloss) | 2 topcoats (scuff-sand well for adhesion) |
| Over existing oil-based paint with water-based | 1 bonding primer/undercoat + 2 topcoats |

**Is one topcoat ever enough?** One coat over existing same-colour paint is sometimes done for budget refreshes, but it is NOT recommended for a professional result. Coverage will be uneven, touch-up areas will be visible, and longevity is significantly reduced. Always specify two topcoats minimum.

### 3.3 Products -- Existing Good Surfaces

| Product | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Selleys Sugar Soap Original** | Wall washing -- 1/2 cup per 10L water |
| **Selleys Spakfilla Rapid** | Quick-dry filler for nail holes and small dents |
| **Dulux 1Step Prep (Water Based)** | Spot-priming bare patches and filler spots |
| **220-grit sandpaper** | Scuff-sanding existing surfaces |

### 3.4 Time/Cost Implications

- Preparation of good-condition surfaces: approximately 1-2 hours per room (wash, sand, fill, spot-prime)
- Much faster than new plasterboard or poor-condition surfaces
- Two topcoats can typically be applied in the same day with 2-4 hours drying between

### 3.5 Common Shortcuts on Good Existing Surfaces

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Skipping the sugar soap wash | Grease, dust, and grime prevent adhesion; paint peels or doesn't bond properly |
| Not scuff-sanding | Paint has poor mechanical adhesion to glossy or smooth existing surfaces |
| Not spot-priming filler patches | Filler absorbs paint differently, showing as dull spots ("flashing") through topcoat |
| Applying only one topcoat | Uneven coverage, roller marks visible, significantly reduced lifespan |
| Painting over damp surfaces | Causes bubbling and blistering as moisture tries to escape |

---

## 4. Existing Painted Surfaces -- Poor Condition

"Poor condition" means visible peeling, flaking, cracking, blistering, chalking, water staining, or significant surface damage.

### 4.1 Step-by-Step Preparation

1. **Assess extent of damage** -- Determine if localised repair or full strip-back is needed
2. **Test for lead paint** -- MANDATORY for any home built before 1970 (see Section 12)
3. **Scrape** -- Remove all loose, flaking, and peeling paint with a paint scraper or broad knife. Scrape until you reach a firmly adhered surface
4. **Wash** -- Sugar soap wash all surfaces as per Section 3
5. **Rinse and dry**
6. **Sand** -- Sand all scraped edges smooth to feather into surrounding paint. Sand entire surface with 120-180 grit sandpaper
7. **Fill** -- Fill all cracks, holes, and uneven areas with appropriate filler. Multiple applications may be needed for deep damage
8. **Sand filler** -- Sand flush with 180-220 grit once dry
9. **Dust down** -- Thorough dusting/tack cloth
10. **Prime entire surface** -- One full coat of sealer/undercoat over the entire surface (not just spot-priming). This is essential for adhesion and uniform porosity
11. **De-nib sand primer** -- Light sand with 220+ grit once dry
12. **Apply two topcoats** -- With de-nib sanding between coats

**Total coats: 3 minimum (1 full primer + 2 topcoats), potentially 4 if severe staining requires a stain-blocking primer first**

### 4.2 When is a Full Strip-Back Required?

Full removal of existing paint is required when:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Paint is peeling/flaking over more than 30-40% of the surface | Full strip-back |
| Multiple layers of old paint that are separating from each other (inter-coat adhesion failure) | Full strip-back |
| Existing paint is heavily crazed/alligatored (network of fine cracks) | Full strip-back |
| Chalking so severe that it cannot be sealed with a binder/sealer | Full strip-back |
| Lead paint that needs to be disturbed (pre-1970 homes) | Professional lead paint removal required |
| Existing paint incompatible with new system (e.g., severely failing oil-based) | Full strip-back |
| Textured paint or coating being removed for smooth finish | Full removal by scraping, sanding, or chemical stripping |

**Methods for full strip-back:**
- **Scraping and sanding** -- Most common, most labour-intensive
- **Chemical strippers** -- Used for heavy multi-layered paint, especially on timber. Products like Diggers Paint Stripper
- **Heat gun** -- Softens paint for scraping. NOT to be used on suspected lead paint (creates toxic fumes)
- **Wet sanding** -- Required if lead paint is present (dry sanding prohibited)

### 4.3 Products -- Poor Condition Surfaces

| Product | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Dulux Precision Sealer Binder** | Oil-based sealer for powdery, chalky surfaces -- binds loose material |
| **Zinsser Gardz Problem Surface Sealer** | Water-based sealer for porous, chalky, crumbling surfaces |
| **Dulux 1Step Prep (Oil Based)** | Primer/sealer for stain blocking and tannin-rich surfaces |
| **Selleys Spakfilla** range | Filling cracks and holes |
| **120-180 grit sandpaper** | Coarser sanding for damaged surfaces |
| **220+ grit sandpaper** | Fine sanding for filler and between coats |

### 4.4 Time/Cost Implications

- Poor-condition preparation can take 3-5x longer than good-condition surfaces
- Full strip-back of a room can add 1-3 days of labour
- Professional painters typically price preparation separately when condition is poor
- The scope document should clearly state the extent of preparation work assumed
- If extensive filling or patching is needed, a plasterer may need to be engaged first

### 4.5 Common Shortcuts on Poor Condition Surfaces

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Painting over flaking paint without scraping | New paint pulls old paint off the wall; peeling within weeks/months |
| Not feathering scraped edges | Visible ridges and edges show through topcoat |
| Spot-priming instead of full priming | Uneven adhesion and porosity; patchy appearance |
| Not using a sealer on chalky surfaces | Paint cannot bond to powder; entire system fails |
| Using heat gun on suspected lead paint | Creates toxic lead fumes -- serious health hazard |

## 5. Previously Wallpapered Surfaces

### 5.1 Scope Responsibility

Wallpaper removal is typically within the painter's scope in Australian residential renovation, though it may be quoted as a separate line item due to the variable time and difficulty involved. Some homeowners engage a separate wallpaper removal specialist, particularly for large or difficult jobs.

### 5.2 Step-by-Step Preparation

**Phase 1: Wallpaper Removal**

1. **Protect floors** -- Drop sheets and plastic sheeting (water will be involved)
2. **Test a corner** -- Peel back to determine wallpaper type (vinyl, paper, fabric) and adhesion strength
3. **Score vinyl wallpaper** -- If vinyl, score the surface with a wallpaper scoring tool (e.g., Paper Tiger) to allow solution to penetrate
4. **Apply removal solution** -- Warm/hot water with wallpaper removal solution (e.g., Selleys Wallpaper Remover) OR use a wallpaper steamer for stubborn paper. Soak each section for 3-5 minutes
5. **Strip wallpaper** -- Peel/scrape off in sections using a broad scraper. Work from top to bottom
6. **Remove residual adhesive** -- Wash all surfaces with warm water and sugar soap or adhesive remover. Scrape any remaining glue residue
7. **Wash clean** -- Final wash with clean water to remove all traces of adhesive and solution

**Phase 2: Surface Repair**

8. **Assess wall damage** -- Wallpaper removal commonly damages the paper face of plasterboard (tears, gouges, delamination)
9. **Skim coat if needed** -- If the wall surface is rough, damaged, or has visible texture from adhesive residue, a skim coat of joint compound is required. This is typically a plasterer's task, not a painter's
10. **Sand** -- Once skim coat is dry, sand smooth with 180-220 grit
11. **Dust down**

**Phase 3: Painting Preparation**

12. **Seal the surface** -- Apply one coat of oil-based primer/sealer. Oil-based is preferred because it does not reactivate water-based wallpaper adhesive residue the way water-based primers can. Alternatively, use a specialised product like Zinsser Gardz Problem Surface Sealer
13. **Sand lightly** -- De-nib sand once dry
14. **Apply two topcoats** -- With de-nib sanding between coats

**Total coats: 3 minimum (1 sealer + 2 topcoats), potentially more if skim coating is required**

### 5.3 Products -- Wallpaper Removal and Prep

| Product | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Selleys Wallpaper Remover** | Wetting agent for wallpaper adhesive dissolution |
| **Wallpaper steamer** (hired equipment) | Heavy-duty removal for stubborn or multiple layers |
| **Paper Tiger / scoring tool** | Perforating vinyl wallpaper to allow solution penetration |
| **Zinsser Gardz Problem Surface Sealer** | Sealing damaged/porous surfaces after wallpaper removal |
| **Dulux 1Step Prep (Oil Based)** | Oil-based primer/sealer that won't reactivate paste residue |
| **Joint compound (plasterer's product)** | Skim coating damaged surfaces |

### 5.4 Time/Cost Implications

- Wallpaper removal is highly variable: $20-$50/hour labour in Australia
- Simple paper wallpaper on sealed plaster: 1-2 hours per room
- Multiple layers of vinyl wallpaper: 4-8+ hours per room
- Skim coating (if needed) adds a full day (application + drying + sanding)
- This is one of the most unpredictable preparation tasks -- always allow contingency in scope

### 5.5 Common Shortcuts on Wallpapered Surfaces

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Painting directly over wallpaper | Seams show through paint, paper bubbles with moisture from paint, peels over time |
| Skim coating over wallpaper (without removing) | Wallpaper separates from wall, taking skim coat and paint with it |
| Using water-based primer over residual paste | Reactivates adhesive, causing bubbling, poor adhesion, and surface failure |
| Not skim coating a damaged surface | Texture, ridges, and damage visible through every coat of paint |
| Rushing removal (pulling too fast) | Tears plasterboard paper face, creating more damage to repair |

## 6. Timber Surfaces -- New

### 6.1 Step-by-Step Preparation

1. **Inspect timber** -- Check for defects, raised grain, knots, resin pockets, moisture content
2. **Sand** -- Sand with 120-grit sandpaper in the direction of the grain, then with 180-grit for a smooth finish. Focus on raised fibres and rough areas
3. **Dust down** -- Remove all sanding dust thoroughly
4. **Seal knots and resin** -- Apply a knot sealer or shellac-based product (e.g., Zinsser B-I-N) to any knots or resin-rich areas to prevent bleed-through
5. **Apply primer/undercoat** -- One coat of timber-specific primer/undercoat. Use oil-based primer for tannin-rich timbers (cedar, redgum, merbau). Water-based PSU is fine for pine and other light timbers
6. **Dry** -- Allow full drying per manufacturer specification (typically 2-4 hours water-based, 16 hours oil-based)
7. **Fill grain and imperfections** -- Once primed, fill nail holes, grain, and imperfections with an appropriate filler. Priming first prevents filler from staining the timber
8. **Sand** -- Sand filler flush with 220-grit sandpaper
9. **Dust down**
10. **Apply first topcoat** -- Enamel paint (water-based or oil-based) by brush, roller, or spray
11. **Sand lightly** -- De-nib with 220-320 grit between coats. This is more important on timber than walls as brush marks and grain texture are more visible
12. **Apply second topcoat**

**Total coats: 3 minimum (1 primer/undercoat + 2 topcoats). Some specifications call for 4 coats (1 primer + 1 undercoat + 2 topcoats) for premium timber finishes.**

### 6.2 Products -- New Timber

| Product | Manufacturer | Use | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----|-------|
| **Dulux 1Step Prep Oil Based PSU** | Dulux | Primer/sealer for tannin-rich timbers | Best tannin blocking, longer dry time, higher odour |
| **Dulux 1Step Prep Water Based PSU** | Dulux | Primer/sealer for light timbers (pine, etc.) | Fast drying, low odour, adequate for non-tannin timbers |
| **Taubmans Wood Primer** | Taubmans | Premium timber primer | Penetrates and provides strong adhesion base, blocks tannin staining on specialist timbers |
| **Haymes Elite Quick Dry Primer Undercoat** | Haymes | Turps-based PSU | Fast drying, excellent tannin blocking |
| **Colormaker Pink Wood Primer** | Colormaker | Timber primer/undercoat | Great flow, excellent filling and sanding, pink colour shows coverage |
| **Intergrain UltraPrep Sealer & Primer** | Intergrain | Timber sealer/primer | Seals bare and coated timber, compatible with water-based topcoats |
| **Zinsser B-I-N** | Zinsser | Shellac-based knot sealer | Blocks knots, resin, and stains from bleeding through |

### 6.3 Key Considerations for New Timber

- **Moisture content:** Timber should be below 15% moisture content before painting. Freshly installed timber in a new build may need time to acclimatise
- **Grain filling:** Some open-grained timbers (oak, ash) benefit from a grain filler before priming for a glass-smooth finish
- **Tannin blocking:** Australian hardwoods are notorious for tannin bleed. Always use an oil-based primer on cedar, redgum, merbau, spotted gum, and similar species
- **Enamel vs flat paint:** Timber trim, doors, and joinery are almost always painted in enamel (semi-gloss or gloss) for durability and washability

### 6.4 Time/Cost Implications

- New timber prep takes longer than plasterboard due to grain, filling, and additional sanding
- Allow 1.5-2 days per room for full trim/door painting (all faces)
- Oil-based primers have 16+ hour recoat times, which significantly affects scheduling
- Water-based primers and enamels allow same-day multi-coat application

### 6.5 Common Shortcuts on New Timber

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Using water-based primer on tannin-rich timber | Yellow/brown tannin stains bleed through topcoat within weeks |
| Skipping knot sealing | Resin and tannin bleed through as yellow/brown spots |
| Not filling after priming | Filler absorbs differently into bare timber vs primed, creating colour variation |
| Insufficient sanding between coats | Brush marks, grain ridges, and nibs visible in enamel finish (especially semi-gloss/gloss) |
| Applying thick coats to "save time" | Runs, sags, curtaining -- especially on vertical surfaces like door frames |

---

## 7. Timber Surfaces -- Existing

### 7.1 Identifying Existing Paint Type

Before painting existing timber, it is essential to identify whether the current coating is oil-based or water-based. This determines the preparation approach and product compatibility.

**The Methylated Spirits Test:**
1. Dampen a clean white rag with methylated spirits (metho)
2. Rub firmly on an inconspicuous area of the painted surface
3. **If paint softens/comes off on the rag** = Water-based paint
4. **If paint does not budge** = Oil-based paint

**Visual indicators:**
- **Yellowed paint** (especially in areas without sunlight) = Likely oil-based (oil-based yellows over time)
- **Non-yellowed, consistent colour** = Likely water-based
- **Very hard, glass-smooth feel** = Likely oil-based
- **Slightly softer, rubbery feel** = Likely water-based

### 7.2 Compatibility Rules

| Existing Paint | New Paint | Preparation Required |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Water-based over water-based | Direct | Sand, clean, apply 2 topcoats |
| Oil-based over oil-based | Direct | Sand, clean, apply 2 topcoats |
| Water-based over oil-based | **Bonding primer required** | Sand well, apply bonding primer/undercoat (e.g., Dulux Aqua Prep PSU), then 2 topcoats |
| Oil-based over water-based | **NOT recommended** | Can cause cracking and peeling. Sand back and use appropriate system |

### 7.3 Step-by-Step Preparation -- Existing Timber (Good Condition)

1. **Identify existing paint type** -- Methylated spirits test (above)
2. **Clean** -- Wash with sugar soap solution, rinse, dry
3. **Sand** -- Scuff-sand entire surface with 180-220 grit to remove gloss and provide mechanical key
4. **Dust down**
5. **Fill** -- Fill any nail holes, dents, or damage with appropriate filler
6. **Sand filler** -- Flush with surrounding surface
7. **Spot-prime** -- Prime any bare timber, filler spots, or damaged areas
8. **Apply bonding primer** -- If switching from oil-based to water-based (see compatibility table)
9. **Apply two topcoats** -- With de-nib sanding between coats for enamel finishes

### 7.4 Oil-Based vs Water-Based on Existing Timber

The Australian painting industry has largely moved toward water-based enamels for timber trim and joinery. Modern water-based enamels offer:

| Property | Oil-Based Enamel | Water-Based Enamel |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Drying time | 16-24 hours between coats | 2-4 hours between coats |
| Yellowing | Yellows significantly over time | Does not yellow |
| Odour | Strong solvent odour | Low odour |
| Durability | Very hard, excellent scrub resistance | Slightly softer, good scrub resistance |
| Finish quality | Glass-smooth, self-levelling | Excellent with modern formulations |
| Cleanup | Turps/mineral spirits | Water |
| VOC content | High | Low |
| Best for | Rarely specified in modern residential work | Standard choice for modern residential |

**Recommendation for scope generation:** Default to water-based enamel topcoats on timber. If existing timber has oil-based paint, include a bonding primer coat in the scope.

### 7.5 Time/Cost Implications

- Existing timber in good condition: Similar time to new timber, minus the knot sealing
- Switching from oil-based to water-based adds the cost of a bonding primer coat
- Badly deteriorated existing enamel on timber (thick buildup, runs, drips from previous bad work) may require full strip-back, which is very labour-intensive on detailed profiles like architraves and skirting

### 7.6 Common Shortcuts on Existing Timber

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Not identifying existing paint type | Applying incompatible paint system causes peeling/cracking |
| Painting water-based directly over oil-based without bonding primer | Poor adhesion; paint peels off in sheets |
| Not sanding glossy existing enamel | New paint has no mechanical key; chips and peels on contact |
| Not cleaning before sanding | Grinds dirt and grease into the surface, contaminating the paint bond |

---

## 8. Patching and Filling

### 8.1 Scope Boundary: Painter vs Plasterer

This is a frequent source of confusion in renovation scopes. The general rule in Australia:

| Work Type | Whose Scope? | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Small nail holes** (< 5mm) | Painter | Standard filling, included in painting scope |
| **Small dents and dings** (< 25mm) | Painter | Filled with lightweight filler as part of prep |
| **Hairline cracks** (< 2mm wide) | Painter | Filled and sanded as part of prep |
| **Screw holes from fixtures** (< 10mm) | Painter | Standard filling |
| **Cracks > 2mm wide** | Grey area | Painter can fill, but may recommend plasterer for recurring/structural cracks |
| **Holes > 50mm** (e.g., old power points, damage) | Plasterer | Requires plasterboard patching, not just filling |
| **Water-damaged plasterboard** | Plasterer | Damaged board must be cut out and replaced |
| **Plasterboard replacement** (from demolition, new openings) | Plasterer | Full plastering scope |
| **Skim coating** (wallpaper damage, textured surface removal) | Plasterer | Applied by plasterer, sanded, then painter takes over |
| **Cornices/ceiling roses** | Plasterer | Installation and finishing is plasterer's scope |

**Scope generation rule:** The painting scope should include "minor filling of nail holes, small cracks, and surface imperfections." Any patching larger than approximately 50mm diameter should be flagged as a plastering item, not a painting item.

### 8.2 Products -- Filling

| Product | Use | Drying Time | Max Depth |
|---------|-----|-------------|-----------|
| **Selleys Spakfilla Rapid** | General-purpose rapid filler for nail holes, dents, small cracks | 30 minutes | ~6mm |
| **Selleys Spakfilla Multipurpose** | Larger fills, deeper cracks | 2-4 hours | ~12mm |
| **Selleys No More Gaps Interior** | Flexible gap filling (not structural filling) | 30 min for paint | 25mm wide x 12mm deep |
| **Dunlop Wall & Ceiling Repair** | Plasterboard patch repairs | Varies | Patch repairs |
| **Joint compound** | Plasterer's product for skim coating and large repairs | 24+ hours | N/A |

### 8.3 Filling Technique for Painters

1. Apply filler slightly proud of the surface using a flexible broad knife
2. Skim in two directions to eliminate air pockets
3. Allow to dry fully (typically 30 minutes for rapid fillers, longer for deep fills)
4. Sand flush with 180-220 grit sandpaper wrapped around a sanding block
5. Dust off
6. Spot-prime the filled area before topcoating (essential to prevent flashing)

### 8.4 Common Shortcuts with Filling

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Not letting filler dry completely before sanding | Filler tears and crumbles, leaves uneven surface |
| Not sanding filler flush | Raised bumps visible through topcoat |
| Not spot-priming filled areas | Filler absorbs paint differently, showing as dull spots (flashing) |
| Using gap filler (caulk) where structural filler is needed | Caulk shrinks and is too flexible; cracks reappear |
| Over-filling and relying on sanding to level | Wastes time and creates excessive dust |

---

## 9. Caulking

### 9.1 Scope Responsibility

Caulking of internal gaps and joints is **standard painter's scope** in Australian residential painting. It is part of preparation work and is performed before priming and topcoating. This is universally accepted as the painter's responsibility, not the carpenter's or plasterer's.

### 9.2 Where Caulking is Required

| Location | Included in Painting Scope? | Notes |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| Skirting board to wall junction | Yes | Top edge of skirting where it meets the wall |
| Architrave to wall junction | Yes | Both sides of door/window architrave where it meets the wall |
| Cornice to wall junction | Usually | May be plasterer's scope for new cornice installation |
| Cornice to ceiling junction | Usually | As above |
| Window frame to wall junction (interior) | Yes | Where the frame meets the wall |
| Door frame to wall junction (interior) | Yes | Where the frame meets the wall |
| Gaps between adjacent trim pieces | Yes | Mitred joints, butt joints |
| Skirting board to floor junction | No (not standard) | This is typically a silicone sealant joint, not paintable caulk |
| Wet area sealing (shower, bath) | No | Silicone sealant, typically tiler's or plumber's scope |
| External caulking (weatherproofing) | Separate item | Often quoted separately due to different products and exposure |

### 9.3 Step-by-Step Caulking Process

1. **Clean the gap** -- Remove any loose material, dust, old failed caulk
2. **Cut caulk tube nozzle** -- Cut at 45 degrees, sized to match the gap width (smaller is better; easier to control)
3. **Apply caulk** -- Hold gun at 45 degrees, push caulk firmly into the gap in a continuous bead
4. **Smooth** -- Run a wet finger or caulking tool along the bead to smooth and press into the gap. Wipe excess with a damp cloth
5. **Dry** -- Allow 30 minutes minimum before painting with water-based paint (2 hours for oil-based)
6. **Paint over** -- Caulk is painted as part of the wall or trim painting. Unpainted caulk will discolour and attract dirt

### 9.4 Products -- Caulking

| Product | Use | Paintable? | Gap Size |
|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
| **Selleys No More Gaps Interior Multipurpose** | General interior caulking -- skirting, architraves, cornices | Yes (30 min) | Up to 25mm wide, 12mm deep |
| **Selleys No More Gaps Coloured Gaps** | Colour-matched caulking where painting is not desired | N/A (pre-coloured) | As above |
| **Selleys No More Gaps Exterior** | External caulking -- weatherboards, eaves | Yes | As above |

### 9.5 Gap Size Guidance

| Gap Width | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| < 2mm | May not need caulking; paint will bridge small gaps |
| 2-8mm | Standard caulking with acrylic gap filler |
| 8-15mm | Caulking with backer rod inserted first for deep gaps |
| > 15mm | Not a caulking job -- this is a carpentry or plastering repair |

### 9.6 Time/Cost Implications

- Caulking is typically 30-60 minutes per room (standard room with skirting, door architraves, window architraves)
- Cost is minimal (1-2 tubes per room at ~$8-12 per tube)
- Labour is the main cost, but it is bundled into overall painting preparation
- Well-caulked joints are one of the biggest visual differences between professional and amateur paint jobs

### 9.7 Common Shortcuts with Caulking

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Skipping caulking entirely | Gaps between trim and walls are immediately visible and look unprofessional |
| Using silicone sealant instead of paintable acrylic caulk | Silicone cannot be painted over; paint beads off and peels |
| Applying too thick a bead | Excessive shrinkage as it dries, cracking, messy appearance |
| Not painting over caulk | Bare caulk yellows, attracts dirt, and deteriorates faster |
| Caulking over existing failed caulk | New caulk fails to bond; remove old caulk first |

## 10. Masking and Protection

### 10.1 Scope Responsibility

Masking and protection is **fully the painter's responsibility** and is included in all painting quotes as a standard item. The painter is responsible for protecting all surfaces not being painted from paint damage.

### 10.2 What Must Be Protected

| Item | Protection Method | Painter's Responsibility? |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Floors -- hard surfaces** | Heavy canvas drop sheets or adhesive floor protection film | Yes |
| **Floors -- carpet** | Adhesive carpet protection film (e.g., Monarch Carpet Protective Film) | Yes |
| **Furniture** | Plastic dust sheets or removed from room | Homeowner moves furniture to centre of room; painter covers with plastic sheeting |
| **Benchtops** | Plastic sheeting or cardboard | Yes |
| **Built-in wardrobes/cabinetry** | Masking tape + plastic sheeting | Yes |
| **Light fittings** | Masking tape or removal | Yes (painter removes/reinstalls basic fittings; electrician for hardwired) |
| **Switch plates and power points** | Removed before painting, reinstalled after | Yes |
| **Door hardware** | Masked or removed | Yes |
| **Window glass** | Masking tape on edges | Yes |
| **Bath/shower/toilet** | Plastic sheeting if painting bathroom | Yes |
| **Staircase handrails** | Masked if not being painted | Yes |
| **External landscaping** | Drop sheets, plastic sheeting | Yes (for external painting) |

### 10.3 Protection Products

| Product | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **Heavy canvas drop sheets** | Floor protection -- main work areas. Durable, reusable, absorbs drips |
| **Plastic drop sheets** | Covering furniture, large areas, carpets (less durable than canvas) |
| **Monarch Carpet Protective Film** | Self-adhesive film for carpet protection. Stays in place, prevents slips |
| **Painter's masking tape** (blue/green) | Edging around fixtures, glass, trim. Clean removal without residue |
| **Masking film with tape edge** | Pre-taped plastic sheeting for quick coverage of large areas |
| **Cardboard sheets** | Protecting benchtops and horizontal surfaces from drips |

### 10.4 Homeowner Responsibilities (Before Painters Arrive)

The scope should note what the homeowner should do before painting commences:

- Move small furniture, personal items, and wall decorations out of the room
- Move large furniture to the centre of the room (painters will cover it)
- Provide clear access to all surfaces being painted
- Remove curtains and blinds if possible (or painters will mask)
- Secure pets away from work areas

### 10.5 Time/Cost Implications

- Protection and masking is typically 30-60 minutes per room for brush/roller application
- For spray application, protection time increases to 1-3 hours per room (see Section 11)
- Materials cost is relatively low ($50-150 per project for drop sheets, tape, plastic)
- Canvas drop sheets are reusable and are part of a professional painter's standard kit
- Protection is not typically itemised separately in a quote -- it is included in the per-room or per-m2 rate

### 10.6 Common Shortcuts with Protection

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Using only thin plastic drop sheets on floors | Slippery, tears easily, doesn't absorb drips -- paint tracks around the house |
| Not masking fixtures properly | Paint on door handles, hinges, light switches looks amateur and is difficult to remove |
| Not removing switch plates | Paint buildup on plate edges looks terrible and is permanent |
| Rushing masking for spray application | Overspray on floors, fixtures, and adjacent rooms. Very costly to fix |
| Not protecting carpet edges at doorways | Paint on carpet is nearly impossible to fully remove |

## 11. Spray Application vs Brush/Roller Preparation

### 11.1 Preparation Comparison

| Preparation Step | Brush/Roller | Spray Application |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Surface cleaning | Standard | Standard (same) |
| Filling and sanding | Standard | Standard (same) |
| Caulking | Standard | Standard (same) |
| Floor protection | Canvas drop sheets | Canvas drop sheets + plastic sheeting overlay |
| Wall masking | Minimal (cut-in by brush) | ALL adjacent surfaces must be masked or covered |
| Fixture protection | Remove or mask | Remove or mask + additional plastic sheeting around all edges |
| Window masking | Tape on glass edges | Full glass masking with tape and paper/plastic |
| Door masking (if different colour) | Tape edges | Full masking with tape and paper/plastic |
| Furniture | Move or cover | MUST be removed from room or completely sealed in plastic |
| Adjacent rooms | Close doors | Seal door openings with plastic sheeting to prevent overspray migration |
| HVAC returns/vents | No special action | Must be sealed/covered to prevent overspray entering ductwork |

### 11.2 Preparation Time Impact

| Room Type | Brush/Roller Prep | Spray Prep | Difference |
|-----------|------------------|------------|------------|
| Standard bedroom | 30-60 min | 1.5-3 hours | 2-3x more masking time |
| Bathroom (small) | 20-40 min | 1-2 hours | 3-4x more masking time |
| Open-plan living | 45-90 min | 2-4 hours | 2-3x more masking time |
| Kitchen (painting walls only) | 40-75 min | 2-3.5 hours | 3-4x more masking time |

**However:** Spray application time is 3-5x faster than brush/roller. For large areas (whole house, new builds, empty renovations), the total project time is often less with spray despite the extra masking.

### 11.3 Back-Rolling Requirement

Per AS/NZS 2311:2017, when paint is applied by spray to a plasterboard surface, the first and last coat must be "back-rolled" -- meaning a roller is run over the sprayed surface while it is still wet. This:

- Ensures even film thickness
- Works paint into the surface texture
- Eliminates overspray texture (orange peel)
- Provides a consistent roller-finish appearance

**Scope implication:** Spray application does NOT eliminate the need for a roller. It requires both a spray operator and a roller operator working simultaneously.

### 11.4 When to Specify Spray vs Brush/Roller

| Scenario | Recommended Method | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| New build, empty house | Spray + back-roll | Fast, efficient, no furniture to protect |
| Full renovation, rooms stripped back | Spray + back-roll | As above |
| Occupied home, room-by-room painting | Brush/roller | Less masking, less disruption, safer for furnishings |
| Single room repaint | Brush/roller | Masking time for spray not justified |
| Ceilings only | Spray + back-roll (often) | Large flat area, efficient |
| Trim/joinery only | Brush (cutting in) + mini-roller | Detail work, spray not practical in occupied home |
| Exterior walls | Spray + back-roll or brush/roller | Depends on access, windows, landscaping |

### 11.5 Common Shortcuts with Spray Application

| Shortcut | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Not back-rolling sprayed plasterboard | Orange peel texture, uneven finish, visible differences in sheen |
| Inadequate masking of adjacent areas | Overspray on floors, ceiling, trim, or adjacent rooms. Very expensive to remedy |
| Not sealing HVAC vents | Paint particles enter ductwork and are distributed throughout the house |
| Spraying too close or too far | Runs/sags (too close) or dry/rough texture (too far). Correct distance is ~30cm |
| Not overlapping spray passes by 50% | Striping and uneven coverage |

## 12. Lead Paint Safety

### 12.1 When to Test

- **Mandatory** for any home built before 1970 (lead in paint up to 50% by weight was common)
- **Recommended** for homes built 1970-1997 (lead progressively reduced: 1% by 1970, 0.5% by 1990, 0.25% by 1992, 0.1% by 1997)
- **Not required** for homes built after 1997

### 12.2 Where Lead Paint is Most Likely Found

- Window frames and sills
- Door frames and doors
- Skirting boards
- Kitchen and bathroom cupboards
- Exterior walls, fascias, and gutters
- Any surface with multiple layers of old paint

### 12.3 Key Safety Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **No dry sanding** | Dry sanding lead paint is prohibited. Creates toxic dust. Use wet sanding only |
| **No heat guns** | Creates toxic lead fumes |
| **No dry scraping** | Use misting with water to suppress dust, or chemical strippers |
| **PPE required** | P2 respirator (minimum), disposable coveralls, gloves, disposable overshoes |
| **Containment** | Seal work area with plastic sheeting, prevent dust migration |
| **Cleanup** | Wet cleanup only. No sweeping (creates airborne dust). HEPA vacuum |
| **Disposal** | Lead paint waste is classified waste -- dispose per local council regulations |
| **Testing** | DIY test kits available but unreliable. Professional XRF testing recommended for certainty |

### 12.4 Scope Implication

The painting scope for pre-1970 homes should include a line item for lead paint testing before any preparation work begins. If lead is detected, preparation methods must be modified accordingly, and this will significantly increase cost and time.

## 13. Common Shortcuts That Lead to Poor Results

This section consolidates the most impactful shortcuts across all surface types.

### 13.1 Top 10 Preparation Failures (Ranked by Impact)

| Rank | Shortcut | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Skipping surface cleaning** | Paint fails to adhere; peels, blisters, and flakes within months |
| 2 | **Not scraping loose paint** | New paint lifts old paint; entire system fails |
| 3 | **Painting over damp surfaces** | Bubbling and blistering as moisture escapes |
| 4 | **Skipping primer on bare surfaces** | Uneven absorption, poor adhesion, flashing, reduced paint life |
| 5 | **Incompatible paint systems** (e.g., water-based over oil without bonding primer) | Inter-coat adhesion failure; peeling in sheets |
| 6 | **Insufficient coats** (1 topcoat instead of 2) | Uneven coverage, visible roller marks, reduced durability |
| 7 | **Not caulking gaps** | Unprofessional appearance; gaps attract dust and insects |
| 8 | **Applying coats too thick** | Runs, sags, cracking; trapped solvents cause bubbling |
| 9 | **Rushing between coats** (not allowing full drying) | Solvent entrapment, bubbling, soft film, poor durability |
| 10 | **Skipping de-nib sanding between coats** | Dust nibs, brush marks, and imperfections visible in finish |

### 13.2 Environmental Conditions That Cause Failure

| Condition | Risk | Minimum Requirement |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Temperature too low | Paint won't cure properly | Min 10 degrees C for water-based, 5 degrees C for oil-based |
| Temperature too high | Paint dries too fast, poor levelling | Max 35 degrees C |
| Humidity too high | Extended drying, risk of sagging | Below 85% relative humidity |
| Direct sunlight on surface | Paint dries unevenly, blistering | Avoid painting in direct sun |
| Poor ventilation | Slow drying, fume buildup | Ensure adequate airflow |
