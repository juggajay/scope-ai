## A. Kitchen Renovation

Kitchen tiling in an Australian residential renovation is primarily focused on splashback tiling (the area between the benchtop and overhead cabinets) and, less commonly, floor tiling. The splashback is both a functional requirement (protecting walls from water, grease, and food splatter) and a major design element. Kitchen tiling must comply with AS 3958:2023 for installation and, where behind a gas cooktop, must meet NCC requirements for clearance from heat sources.

**Key principle:** All tiling work should be performed by a licensed tiler. While tiling is not a licensed trade in all Australian states (unlike plumbing or electrical), engaging a qualified tiler with relevant trade certification ensures compliance with AS 3958:2023 and results in warranty-eligible work. Many builders and homeowners now require evidence of trade qualifications.

### A1. Kitchen Splashback Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The tiled area on the wall between the benchtop surface and the underside of overhead cabinets (or rangehood). This is the most common tiling scope item in a kitchen renovation. The splashback protects the wall substrate from water, steam, grease, and food splatter while serving as a primary visual design element in the kitchen. |
| **What it involves** | Preparing the wall surface (must be flat, clean, and primed). Applying tile adhesive using the correct notched trowel size for the tile format. Setting tiles in the chosen layout pattern. Grouting all joints. Applying silicone sealant where tiles meet the benchtop and where tiles meet the underside of overhead cabinets. Cutting tiles to fit around power points, window openings, and rangehood ducting. |
| **Area calculation** | Standard splashback height is **600mm** (from benchtop surface to underside of overhead cabinets). This is the industry default for Australian kitchens, though custom kitchen designs may use 650mm, 700mm, or 750mm. Splashback area = linear length of benchtop with overhead cabinets above x splashback height. Behind the cooktop, the splashback typically extends higher (to the base of the rangehood, often 750-900mm from benchtop) and may be wider than the cooktop itself. Behind a freestanding cooker, the splashback extends to the full height of the wall or to 900mm minimum. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **Subway tiles:** 75x150mm (classic), 100x200mm, 100x300mm (most popular in Australia 2024-2026). **Large format:** 300x600mm, 600x600mm, or slab tiles up to 1000x3000mm (minimal grout lines, contemporary look). **Mosaics:** Sheet-mounted (e.g., 300x300mm sheets of small tiles — penny round, hexagonal, fish scale). **Kit Kat / finger tiles:** 25x150mm or similar narrow format. All tiles must be rated for wall use (PEI rating is not critical for walls as they do not bear foot traffic). |
| **Layout patterns** | **Stack bond (grid):** Tiles aligned vertically and horizontally in a perfect grid. Simplest to install, lowest labour cost. Clean, modern aesthetic. Works best with rectified tiles and tight grout joints. **Brick bond (stretcher bond/running bond):** Each row offset by half a tile width. The most popular splashback pattern in Australia. Traditional but versatile. Standard labour rate. **Herringbone:** Tiles set at 45-degree angles in a V-shape. Requires 15-20% additional tile quantity due to angled perimeter cuts. Premium labour — typically 20-30% more than standard brick bond due to complexity and time. **Chevron:** Similar to herringbone but tiles are cut at a parallelogram angle rather than rectangular. Even higher waste percentage (up to 20%). Premium labour. **Vertical stack:** Subway tiles oriented vertically. Growing in popularity. Standard labour cost. |
| **Grout type** | **Epoxy grout (RECOMMENDED for kitchens):** Waterproof, stain-resistant, does not require sealing, consistent colour. Ideal for kitchen splashbacks where exposure to grease, food, and water is constant. Costs 3-5x more than cement grout for product alone, plus tiler may charge a premium (epoxy is harder to work with and sets faster). **Cement-based grout:** Lower cost, easier to apply, but absorbs water and stains. Requires sealing (initially and periodically). Acceptable for kitchens if sealed properly, but epoxy is the professional recommendation for splashbacks. |
| **Grout joint width** | **Rectified tiles:** 1.5-2.5mm joints (tight, minimal grout lines). **Non-rectified tiles:** 3-5mm joints to accommodate size variation between tiles. AS 3958:2023 recommends 1.5mm minimum for dust-pressed wall tiles and 6mm for extruded tiles. The Australian standard does not mandate a specific joint width but requires the joint to accommodate manufacturing size tolerances. |
| **Edge finishing** | **Where tiles meet benchtop:** Silicone sealant joint (not grout) in a colour-matched or neutral silicone. This joint must be flexible to accommodate differential movement between the benchtop and wall. Typical joint width 2-3mm. **Where tiles meet overhead cabinets:** Silicone sealant joint (flexible) between the top tile edge and the underside of the cabinet. If no overhead cabinets, the top edge requires finishing — options include metal trim (Schluter profile in aluminium, stainless steel, or brass), bullnose tile edge, or mitre-cut tile edge. **At external corners and exposed edges:** Metal trim profile (L-shaped or quarter-round) or mitre-cut tile edges at 45 degrees. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — splashback tiling is included in virtually every Australian kitchen renovation. Some homeowners choose alternative splashback materials (glass panels, stone slabs, pressed metal) but tiles remain the most common choice by a significant margin. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023 for tile installation. Wall substrate must be suitable — cement sheet (Villaboard/Hardiflex 6mm minimum) or rendered masonry. Plasterboard alone is acceptable for dry areas but cement sheet is preferred behind splashbacks. Minimum adhesive coverage of 65% for wall tiles in wet areas (AS 3958:2023). Gas cooktop clearance: if tiles are classified as combustible, a minimum of 200mm horizontal clearance from the cooktop burners is required per NCC. Non-combustible tiles (ceramic, porcelain) can be installed directly behind a gas cooktop without clearance restrictions. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not confirming the exact splashback height with the kitchen designer before ordering tiles — a 50mm height difference can ruin the tile layout and require additional cuts or a visible gap. (2) Not accounting for power point cutouts — splashbacks typically have 2-4 power points that require precise tile cutting. (3) Using cement grout without sealing it — grease and food stains permanently discolour unsealed cement grout within months. (4) Not using flexible silicone (instead of grout) at the benchtop-to-tile junction — rigid grout cracks due to differential movement. (5) Choosing a complex pattern (herringbone) without budgeting for the 20-30% labour premium and 15-20% extra tile quantity. (6) Not waterproofing behind the splashback where required — while not a wet area per AS 3740, areas directly behind the sink and cooktop benefit from a waterproof membrane or water-resistant substrate. (7) Installing tiles before the benchtop — tiles should sit on top of the benchtop or have a precise gap for the benchtop to slide under. Coordination with the benchtop installer is critical. |

### A2. Kitchen Splashback Feature Panel (Behind Cooktop)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A distinct tiled section behind the cooktop that differs from the main splashback in tile type, size, pattern, or material. This creates a visual focal point in the kitchen and is a common design feature in Australian renovations. |
| **What it involves** | Tiling a defined area (typically the width of the cooktop or rangehood, from benchtop to rangehood base) with a different tile or pattern than the surrounding splashback. Requires careful planning of transition lines where the feature tile meets the main splashback tile. May require different adhesive or grout if the feature tile is a different material (e.g., natural stone vs ceramic). |
| **Typical specifications** | Feature panel width: typically 600mm, 750mm, or 900mm (matching the cooktop or rangehood width). Height: benchtop to rangehood base (typically 750-900mm, taller than the standard 600mm splashback). Common feature tile choices: **mosaic sheet tiles** (hexagonal, penny round, fish scale), **marble-look porcelain**, **zellige/handmade tiles**, **patterned/decorative tiles**, or the same tile as the main splashback laid in a different pattern (e.g., herringbone feature behind cooktop with brick bond elsewhere). |
| **Edge transition** | Where the feature tile meets the main splashback tile, options include: (a) a simple butt joint with a grout line — works if both tiles are the same thickness; (b) a metal trim strip separating the two tile types; (c) a shadow gap (recessing one tile slightly). Tile thickness differences between the feature and main tiles must be managed — if the feature tile is thicker, additional adhesive build-up is needed on the main splashback to create a flush surface, or the transition must be detailed with trim. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — a design upgrade, not a structural or compliance requirement. Adds cost for additional tile type, more complex cutting, and potentially different grout/adhesive. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Same as main splashback (AS 3958:2023). If behind a gas cooktop, ensure the feature tile material is non-combustible or meets NCC clearance requirements. Mosaic tiles on mesh backing should use adhesive compatible with the mesh material. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not aligning the feature panel edges with the rangehood or cooktop edges — misalignment looks unintentional and unprofessional. (2) Using tiles of significantly different thickness without planning the transition — creates an unsightly step between feature and main tiles. (3) Not ordering enough feature tile — specialty and handmade tiles often have long lead times and limited stock. Order 15-20% extra. (4) Using incompatible grout between the two tile types (e.g., epoxy on the main splashback but cement on the feature, or vice versa, creating a visible difference in grout appearance). |

### A3. Kitchen Window Sill Tiling

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the window sill (the horizontal ledge at the base of a kitchen window) when the window is located within the splashback area. Common in Australian kitchens where the sink is positioned under a window. |
| **What it involves** | Tiling the horizontal window sill surface and the vertical window reveals (sides and top of the window opening) to match or complement the splashback tiles. Requires precise measurement and cutting to fit tiles around the window frame. The sill must have a slight fall (slope) toward the room to prevent water pooling against the window frame. |
| **Typical specifications** | The window sill tile typically matches the splashback tile. Sill depth depends on wall thickness — typically 100-200mm. Tile is cut to fit the sill depth with a finished front edge (bullnose, mitred, or metal trim). Window reveals (sides and top) are tiled with tiles cut to the reveal depth (typically 100-150mm). All junctions between tile and window frame are sealed with silicone (not grout) to allow for movement and provide a waterproof seal. Substrate: cement sheet (Villaboard) is recommended for window sills and reveals as it provides a stable, water-resistant base. Standard plasterboard is not suitable for window sills in wet-adjacent areas. |
| **Edge finishing** | The front edge of the sill tile (the edge facing into the room) must be finished. Options: **Bullnose tile** (if available in the same tile range), **metal trim profile** (Schluter or similar L-profile or quarter-round), **mitred edge** (tile cut at 45 degrees and joined to a vertical piece — creates a clean, trimless look but requires skilled cutting). |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — required when a window exists within the splashback area. If there is no window in the splashback zone, this item is not applicable. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023. Substrate must be water-resistant (cement sheet recommended). Silicone sealant at all tile-to-window-frame junctions. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not creating a fall (slope) on the sill — water pools against the window frame and causes rot or mould. (2) Using plasterboard as substrate for the sill — it absorbs moisture and deteriorates. Cement sheet is essential. (3) Grouting (instead of siliconing) the junction between tile and window frame — grout cracks due to differential movement and allows water ingress. (4) Not considering the window sill depth when selecting tile size — a 300mm tile may overhang a 150mm sill, requiring a cut that leaves an awkward narrow strip. (5) Forgetting to tile the reveals (sides) of the window — leaving them painted while the sill is tiled looks incomplete. |

### A4. Kitchen Floor Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the kitchen floor. While many Australian kitchen renovations retain existing floor finishes or use alternative materials (timber, vinyl, hybrid), floor tiling remains a popular choice for its durability, water resistance, and ease of cleaning. |
| **What it involves** | Removing existing floor covering (if applicable). Preparing the substrate (concrete slab or sheet flooring over timber frame). Levelling the substrate with a self-levelling compound if required (floors must be flat to within tolerance — see F2 for substrate flatness requirements). Waterproofing is not required for kitchen floors under AS 3740:2021 (kitchens are not classified as wet areas unless they contain a floor waste). Applying tile adhesive and setting tiles. Grouting. Applying silicone at perimeter junctions (tile to skirting, tile to cabinetry kickboards). Installing transition strips where tiles meet other floor materials at doorways. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **Large format porcelain:** 600x600mm, 600x1200mm (most popular for modern Australian kitchens). **Standard porcelain/ceramic:** 300x300mm, 450x450mm. **Timber-look porcelain planks:** 200x1200mm, 200x1000mm (very popular — provides the look of timber with the durability of porcelain). **Natural stone:** Marble, travertine, limestone (premium, requires sealing). Porcelain tiles are preferred over ceramic for kitchen floors due to lower water absorption (<0.5%) and higher durability. |
| **Slip resistance** | Kitchen floors are not specifically mandated by the BCA to have slip-rated tiles (unless the kitchen has a floor waste, making it a wet area). However, **P3 minimum (or R10)** is recommended by industry best practice for any area where water spills are likely. Most porcelain floor tiles in standard ranges meet P3/R10 or higher. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — depends on the homeowner's choice of floor material. Floor tiling is a separate scope item from splashback tiling and should be quoted independently. If the kitchen floor is being tiled as part of a larger open-plan floor tiling scope (kitchen/dining/living), it falls under the Living Areas (Section D) scope. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023 for installation. Adhesive coverage: 90-100% for floor tiles (no voids around edges per AS 3958:2023). Movement joints required per AS 3958:2023 Section 5.4.7 — maximum 4.5m spacing in each direction for internal floors (see F3). Transition strips at junctions with other floor materials must account for height differences. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not levelling the substrate before tiling — large format tiles amplify any unevenness, causing lippage and rocking. (2) Tiling the floor before cabinetry is installed (debatable — some tilers tile the entire floor first, others tile up to the cabinet footprint; the key is coordinating with the kitchen installer to avoid height issues with appliance fitment under benchtops). (3) Not planning tile layout to avoid thin slivers at room edges or door openings — a professional tiler will dry-lay and centre the tile layout to ensure balanced cuts. (4) Forgetting transition strips at doorways — especially where kitchen tile meets hallway carpet or timber, a transition strip is needed for a clean, safe junction. (5) Using incorrect adhesive for large format tiles — tiles over 400x400mm require medium-bed adhesive and back-buttering (adhesive applied to both the substrate and the back of the tile). |

## B. Bathroom Renovation

Bathroom tiling is the most complex and specification-intensive tiling scope in a residential renovation. It involves floor tiling with fall-to-waste requirements, wall tiling at various heights, shower-specific tiling with waterproofing integration, and numerous detail items (niches, hobs, bath surrounds). Compliance with AS 3740:2021 (waterproofing), AS 3958:2023 (tile installation), and AS 4586:2013 (slip resistance) is critical. Waterproofing must be completed and certified by a licensed waterproofer before any tiling commences.

**Key principle:** Tiling in bathrooms is applied over a waterproofing membrane. The tiler must not damage the membrane during installation. The waterproofer and tiler must coordinate closely — in many cases, the same tradesperson or company performs both waterproofing and tiling to ensure system compatibility and warranty coverage.

---

### B1. Bathroom Floor Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the entire bathroom floor. The bathroom floor must be waterproofed (AS 3740:2021) before tiling. The floor must have adequate fall (gradient) to the floor waste for drainage. This is one of the most technically demanding tiling tasks in residential renovation. |
| **What it involves** | (1) Substrate preparation — the screed (sand/cement bed) must be laid by the tiler or screeder to create the required fall to the floor waste. The screed is laid over the waterproof membrane. (2) Tiles are bedded into adhesive applied over the screed, maintaining the fall gradient. (3) Grouting all joints. (4) Silicone sealant at all perimeter junctions (tile to wall, tile to shower screen, tile to bath, tile to vanity, tile to door threshold). (5) Installing the floor waste grate (point drain or tile-insert drain). |
| **Fall (gradient) requirements** | AS 3740:2021 and AS 3958:2023 specify fall requirements: **General bathroom floor (with vertical separation from shower — e.g., shower screen, hob, step-down):** Minimum fall of 1:100 toward the floor waste. **Shower floor (no vertical separation or within shower enclosure with hob):** Minimum fall of 1:80, maximum fall of 1:50. The standard range is 1:60 (approximately 10mm fall per 600mm) to 1:80 (approximately 12.5mm per metre). **Important:** The fall must be consistent — no ponding (standing water) anywhere on the floor after the shower is used. Water must drain completely to the floor waste. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **Standard format:** 300x300mm — the most practical size for bathroom floors as it follows the contours of the fall to waste with minimal lippage. **Mosaics:** Sheet-mounted mosaics (e.g., 50x50mm, 25x25mm on 300x300mm sheets) — excellent for following complex falls, especially to central point drains where the fall comes from all four directions. Used frequently on shower floors. **Large format (with linear drain only):** 600x600mm or 600x1200mm — only feasible if a **linear drain (channel drain)** is installed along one wall, allowing a single-direction fall. Large format tiles cannot follow a four-way fall to a central point drain without visible lippage or "tenting." **Hexagonal tiles:** 100mm or 200mm hexagons — follow fall contours well, modern aesthetic. **Penny round mosaics:** Diameter 19-25mm on mesh sheets — excellent for fall compliance, popular for shower floors. |
| **Slip resistance** | **Minimum P3 (or R10)** for bathroom floors per industry best practice. AS 4586:2013 defines the testing methodology. The BCA/NCC does not mandate specific slip ratings for residential bathroom floors (only for commercial/public buildings and stair nosings), but **P3/R10 is the accepted industry standard** for residential wet areas. Most bathroom floor tiles from reputable Australian suppliers are rated P3 or higher. **Shower floors should be P4 (or R11) minimum** for barefoot wet conditions. Mosaics inherently have higher slip resistance due to the quantity of grout joints providing texture. |
| **Waterproofing integration** | The waterproof membrane is applied before tiling. The membrane must extend: up the walls a minimum of 150mm from the finished floor level in the general bathroom area; up the walls a minimum of 1800mm in the shower area (or 50mm above the shower rose, whichever is higher). The floor waste must have a puddle flange that integrates with the membrane. The tiler must use adhesive compatible with the membrane system. Bond breakers or flexible fillets must be installed at all wall-floor junctions before the membrane is applied. The tiler must not puncture or damage the membrane during tile installation. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — every bathroom renovation includes floor tiling. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023 (tile installation), AS 3740:2021 (waterproofing of wet areas), AS 4586:2013 (slip resistance). Adhesive coverage must be 90-100% for wet area floor tiles per AS 3958:2023 with no voids around tile edges. Movement joints required per AS 3958:2023 at perimeters and at maximum 4.5m centres. Waterproofing certification must be obtained before tiling commences. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Insufficient fall to the floor waste — causes ponding (standing water), mould growth, and slip hazards. This is the number one defect in bathroom tiling. (2) Using large format tiles (600x600mm+) with a central point drain — the tile cannot follow the four-way fall, resulting in ponding or severe lippage. Large format floor tiles require a linear drain. (3) Damaging the waterproof membrane during tile installation — punctures compromise the entire waterproofing system. (4) Not checking the floor waste position before screeding — the waste position determines the fall directions and affects tile layout. (5) Insufficient adhesive coverage — voids under floor tiles in wet areas allow water to track under tiles, degrading the adhesive and substrate. (6) Using tiles with inadequate slip resistance — P2 or lower tiles on a bathroom floor become dangerously slippery when wet. (7) Not coordinating with the waterproofer on adhesive compatibility — some adhesives are incompatible with certain membrane systems. |

### B2. Bathroom Wall Tiling — General Area (Non-Shower)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the bathroom walls outside the shower enclosure. This includes walls behind the vanity, around the toilet, and any remaining walls. The height of wall tiling is a significant scope variable — options range from no tiling (paint only above the waterproof zone) to full floor-to-ceiling tiling. |
| **What it involves** | Preparing the wall substrate (cement sheet such as James Hardie Villaboard 6mm is the standard substrate for bathroom wall tiling in Australia). Applying tile adhesive and setting tiles. Grouting. Silicone at all internal corners, at tile-to-floor junctions, and at tile-to-fixture junctions (vanity, mirror, toilet). |
| **Tiling height options** | **Full height (floor to ceiling — 2400mm typical):** Most common in modern Australian bathroom renovations. Creates a seamless, waterproof, easy-to-clean surface. Higher material and labour cost. Recommended when ceiling height is 2400mm or less. **2100mm height:** Tiles to the top of the shower area line (common compromise). Creates one consistent tile line around the room at the typical shower height. **1200mm height (half height):** Tiles to approximately halfway up the wall. Budget-friendly option. Allows for a painted feature colour above the tile line. Suitable where moisture exposure is low (away from shower). **Minimum (waterproof zone only):** Tiles only where required by AS 3740:2021 — 150mm above the basin, 150mm above the bath edge (for walls adjacent to fixtures). Above the tile line, the wall is painted with a moisture-resistant paint. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **300x600mm:** The most popular bathroom wall tile size in Australia. Provides good coverage with manageable weight and few grout lines. Typically laid in a brick bond (horizontal, offset) pattern. **600x600mm:** Large format, modern aesthetic. Heavier — requires skilled installation and medium-bed adhesive on walls. **Subway tiles (various sizes):** 75x150mm (classic), 75x300mm, 100x300mm. Extremely popular, especially in brick bond pattern. **Large format slabs:** 600x1200mm, 900x1800mm. Minimal grout lines, dramatic look. Requires two-person installation, suction cups, and medium-bed adhesive. Not suitable for DIY. **Mosaics:** Used as accent strips, niche linings, or feature panels. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — bathroom wall tiling at some height is included in every bathroom renovation. The height is the key variable and must be specified in the scope. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023. Minimum adhesive coverage 65% for wall tiles in wet areas. Substrate must be cement sheet (not standard plasterboard) in wet areas. Water-resistant plasterboard (green board) is acceptable only for areas outside the designated wet area per AS 3740:2021. Walls adjacent to basins must have water-resistant lining to a minimum of 150mm above the fixture. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not specifying the tiling height clearly in the scope — "tile the bathroom walls" is ambiguous and causes disputes. Always state the height in millimetres or "floor to ceiling." (2) Using standard plasterboard instead of cement sheet in wet-adjacent areas. (3) Not planning the tile layout to avoid thin slivers at corners, ceiling lines, or fixture cut-outs. (4) Inconsistent tile line heights around the room — if tiling to 2100mm, that line must be level and consistent on every wall. (5) Using the wrong adhesive for the tile weight — heavy large-format wall tiles require C2 (improved) adhesive and back-buttering. (6) Not leaving a silicone joint (instead of grout) at internal corners — grout cracks at corners due to differential movement between walls. |

### B3. Shower Wall Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the walls within the shower enclosure. Shower walls receive the most direct and sustained water exposure of any surface in the bathroom. All shower walls must be tiled over a waterproof membrane to a minimum height defined by AS 3740:2021. |
| **What it involves** | Tiling over the waterproof membrane (which has been applied to cement sheet substrate). Adhesive must be compatible with the membrane. Full coverage tiling from the shower floor up to the required height. Grouting all joints. Silicone at all internal corners, at tile-to-shower-screen junctions, and at tile-to-shower-tray/hob junctions. |
| **Minimum tiling height** | **1800mm from finished floor level, or 50mm above the shower rose outlet height — whichever is greater** (per AS 3740:2021). In practice, most Australian bathroom renovations tile shower walls to **full ceiling height (2400mm)** or to a consistent line at **2100mm**. Tiling only to the 1800mm minimum leaves an exposed painted strip at the top that is difficult to maintain and aesthetically inferior. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | Same range as general bathroom walls (B2 above). The most popular shower wall tiles in Australia are **300x600mm porcelain** in brick bond, **subway tiles** in various sizes, and **large format tiles (600x1200mm)** for a minimal-grout look. Shower walls often use the same tile as the general bathroom walls, with a potential feature tile on the shower back wall. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — shower wall tiling is mandatory in every bathroom renovation. Cannot be omitted. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023, AS 3740:2021. Waterproof membrane must be certified before tiling. Minimum adhesive coverage 65% for wall tiles in wet areas. In shower areas where tiles will be directly and frequently wetted, higher coverage (80-90%) is recommended by industry best practice. Adhesive must be compatible with the waterproof membrane. Silicone (not grout) at all internal corners and change-of-plane junctions. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not tiling to adequate height — tiling only to 1800mm when the shower rose is at 1900mm-2000mm leaves an exposed, unmaintained gap. (2) Using incompatible adhesive over the waterproof membrane — some adhesives delaminate from certain membranes. Always verify compatibility with the membrane manufacturer. (3) Grouting internal corners instead of using silicone — grout cracks and water penetrates behind tiles at corners. (4) Insufficient adhesive coverage — voids behind shower wall tiles allow water to accumulate, degrading adhesive and potentially breaching the membrane over time. (5) Not coordinating shower screen fixing points with the tiler — screen brackets must be drilled through tiles and membrane, requiring the waterproofer to repair any membrane penetrations. |

### B4. Shower Floor Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the floor of the shower recess. This is one of the most technically critical tiling items due to the strict fall-to-waste requirements and the interaction with waterproofing, the drainage system, and tile format. |
| **What it involves** | The shower floor is screeded (over the waterproof membrane) to create the required fall to the floor waste. Tiles are then set into adhesive over the screed. The tile format must be appropriate for the fall configuration (see below). Grouting must be thorough — no voids. A tile-insert floor waste or standard grate is installed flush with the tile surface. |
| **Fall requirements** | **Central point drain:** Fall must come from all four directions toward the centre point drain. Minimum fall 1:80, maximum 1:50. This creates a "four-way" or "cone" fall. Only small-format tiles (300x300mm or smaller) or mosaics can follow this multi-directional fall without significant lippage. **Linear drain (channel drain):** Fall runs in a single direction toward the linear drain, which is typically installed along one wall (usually the back wall or the wall opposite the shower entry). Single-direction fall allows the use of large format tiles (600x600mm, 600x1200mm) as the fall does not require multi-directional bending. Minimum fall 1:80. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **Mosaics (RECOMMENDED for central point drains):** 50x50mm, 25x25mm on mesh sheets, penny rounds (19-25mm diameter), hexagonal mosaics. These follow complex fall contours and provide excellent slip resistance through numerous grout lines. **300x300mm tiles:** Acceptable for central point drains in smaller shower recesses. Larger than 300x300mm is problematic with a central drain. **Large format tiles (600x600mm, 600x1200mm):** ONLY suitable with a linear drain. The fall runs in one direction, so the flat tile plane can follow the gradient. **Feature tiles:** Some homeowners use a different tile on the shower floor for contrast (e.g., mosaic floor with large format walls). |
| **Slip resistance** | **Minimum P4 (or R11)** recommended for shower floors. The shower floor is the highest-risk slip area in the home — bare feet on a wet, soapy, sloping surface. Mosaic tiles inherently provide higher slip resistance due to the density of grout joints. Textured or matte-finish tiles provide better grip than polished tiles. **Never use polished/glossy tiles on a shower floor.** |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — required in every bathroom renovation with a shower. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023, AS 3740:2021, AS 4586:2013. Fall to waste must comply with AS 3740:2021 (1:80 to 1:50). Adhesive coverage 90-100% — no voids around edges (wet area floor). Waterproof membrane integrity must be maintained. Floor waste puddle flange must integrate with membrane. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using tiles too large for a central point drain — 600x600mm tiles cannot follow a four-way fall without severe lippage or ponding. (2) Insufficient fall — water ponds on the shower floor, creating mould and slip hazards. (3) Lippage between tiles on the fall — tiles must be set carefully to follow the screed gradient without creating "lips" that catch toes or trap water. (4) Not using a tile levelling system on the shower floor — levelling clips/wedges are essential to minimise lippage on falls. (5) Poor grouting on shower floors — grout voids allow water under tiles. (6) Choosing polished/glossy tiles for the shower floor — extremely dangerous slip hazard. |

### B5. Shower Niche Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A recessed shelf built into the shower wall for storing soap, shampoo, and other items. The niche is tiled on all internal surfaces (back wall, top, bottom, and two sides). The niche opening edges must be finished with an appropriate edge treatment. Shower niches are one of the most requested features in Australian bathroom renovations. |
| **What it involves** | The niche is framed (typically during the carpentry/framing stage) and lined with cement sheet. The waterproofer applies the membrane continuously over the niche surfaces (inside and around). The tiler tiles all internal surfaces of the niche — back, top, bottom (shelf), and two sides. The niche bottom must have a slight fall (2-3mm) toward the shower to prevent water pooling inside. The niche opening edges are finished with one of the edge treatment options below. |
| **Standard dimensions** | **Width:** Typically 300mm, 350mm, or 600mm (double width). Must be planned to align with stud spacing (standard 450mm or 600mm centres) — a niche must fit between studs unless additional framing is provided. **Height:** 300mm (single shelf) or 600mm (double shelf with a horizontal divider). **Depth:** 80-100mm minimum (deep enough for standard shampoo bottles — a 90mm depth is the most common). Must not protrude into the wall cavity so far that it weakens the wall structure or interferes with plumbing. |
| **Edge finishing options** | **Mitred edge (45-degree mitre):** The tile is cut at a 45-degree angle at the niche opening, creating a clean, trim-free edge where two mitred tiles meet at the corner. This is the premium, most contemporary option. Requires skilled cutting (wet saw with mitre adjustment). The mitre must not be so thin at the edge that it chips — leave at least 1-2mm of tile face at the tip. **Bullnose tile:** A tile with a factory-finished rounded edge used at the niche opening. Provides a smooth, safe edge. Limited to tile ranges that offer a matching bullnose piece. Classic, traditional look. **Metal trim (Schluter profile):** An L-shaped or quarter-round metal profile (aluminium, stainless steel, or brass) installed at the niche opening edges. Clean and modern. Available in various finishes to match tapware (brushed nickel, matte black, brushed brass). **Pencil liner:** A small, cylindrical tile trim piece placed at the edge. Decorative, traditional feel. Less common in contemporary bathrooms. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — shower niches are a very common inclusion but not structurally required. Must be specified in scope if included. Number, size, and position of niches should be confirmed. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Waterproofing must be continuous across all niche surfaces — the membrane must not be interrupted at the niche framing. AS 3740:2021 applies. Niche bottom must have a fall toward the shower opening. If the niche is lit (LED strip lighting — increasingly common), electrical work must be completed before waterproofing and tiling. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not waterproofing inside the niche — water sitting on an unwaterproofed niche shelf leaks into the wall cavity. (2) No fall on the niche bottom — water pools in the niche, growing mould and staining grout. (3) Niche positioned at a stud location — requires additional framing and creates coordination issues. Plan niche positions during the framing stage. (4) Niche too shallow — standard bottles (especially pump bottles) don't fit. Minimum 80mm depth, 90mm preferred. (5) Poor mitre cuts that chip or leave razor-sharp edges — mitres must be executed cleanly with a quality wet saw. (6) Not aligning the niche tile pattern with the surrounding wall tile pattern — the niche tiles should continue the wall tile layout seamlessly through the niche back wall. |

### B6. Shower Hob (Curb) Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The raised threshold (hob or curb) at the entrance to the shower recess that contains water within the shower area. The hob is typically 50-100mm high and is tiled on the top, inside face (shower side), and outside face (bathroom side). |
| **What it involves** | The hob is constructed from masonry (bricks, concrete blocks, or formed concrete) during the building stage. The waterproofer applies the membrane continuously over the hob — across the top, down both faces, and extending a minimum of 50mm onto the bathroom floor on the outside face. The tiler tiles all three visible faces of the hob (top, inside, outside). The top of the hob must have a slight fall toward the shower side to direct any water back into the shower. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Height:** 50-100mm above the finished floor level on the bathroom side. Lower hobs (50mm) with frameless shower screens are the contemporary preference. Higher hobs (75-100mm) are required for shower-over-bath configurations or where the floor waste is recessed. **Width:** Typically 75-100mm (one brick width). **Tile application:** Top of hob — tiled with the same tile as the bathroom floor or shower floor (homeowner preference). Inside face — tiled with the same tile as the shower walls. Outside face — tiled with the same tile as the bathroom floor or walls. All edges where hob tiles meet floor or wall tiles — silicone sealant (not grout) to accommodate movement. |
| **Hobless (step-down) alternative** | Increasingly, Australian bathrooms use a **hobless (zero-threshold) shower** where there is no raised curb. Instead, the shower floor is recessed (stepped down 10-15mm below the bathroom floor level) and a channel drain or linear drain contains water. This requires precise floor level coordination between the tiler, waterproofer, and builder. The scope should specify whether the shower has a hob or is hobless. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — required if the shower design includes a hob. Not required for hobless/step-down shower designs. The scope must specify which configuration is being used. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 — waterproof membrane must extend continuously over the hob and minimum 50mm onto the bathroom floor outside the hob. AS 3958:2023 for tile installation. Silicone at all change-of-plane junctions. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Waterproof membrane not extending far enough over the hob — water tracks under tiles and leaks onto the bathroom floor. (2) Hob top not falling toward the shower — water sits on top of the hob and drips onto the bathroom floor. (3) Using grout instead of silicone at hob-to-floor and hob-to-wall junctions — grout cracks and leaks. (4) Hob too high for the shower screen design — frameless screens often require specific hob heights for channel installation. Coordinate with shower screen supplier. (5) Not tiling the outside face of the hob — leaving raw render or cement looks unfinished. |

### B7. Bath Surround Tiling

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the walls surrounding a bathtub. The scope varies significantly depending on whether the bath is freestanding, built-in (alcove/drop-in), or a shower-over-bath configuration. |
| **What it involves — Built-in/alcove bath** | Tiling the walls adjacent to the bath from the bath rim upward. AS 3740:2021 requires walls adjacent to a bath to be water-resistant to a minimum of **150mm above the bath rim** for the extent of the bath. In practice, most renovations tile to a consistent height (1200mm, 1800mm, or full ceiling height) on walls adjacent to the bath. If the bath has a shower over it, the walls must be waterproofed and tiled to a minimum of **1800mm** (same as a shower enclosure). The bath apron (front panel) may also be tiled if it is a built-in/drop-in bath without a pre-finished apron. |
| **What it involves — Freestanding bath** | Freestanding baths do not require wall tiling by code, but it is recommended to tile (or apply a water-resistant finish) on the wall behind and adjacent to the bath to at least **300-600mm above the bath rim** to protect from splashing. If a shower mixer or handheld shower is installed above the freestanding bath, the wall behind must be waterproofed and tiled to the same standard as a shower wall (1800mm minimum). |
| **Typical specifications** | Wall tile behind a bath matches the general bathroom wall tile. Silicone sealant (not grout) at the junction between the bath rim and the wall tiles — this joint must be flexible to accommodate the bath's movement when filled with water (a full bathtub adds significant weight that can cause minor deflection). The silicone colour should match the grout or be a neutral colour. **Bath apron tiling (if applicable):** Tiles are applied to the front face of a drop-in or built-in bath frame. Requires a cement sheet substrate fixed to the bath frame. Must include an access panel for bath plumbing maintenance. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — required where a bath is present. The extent of tiling depends on the bath type and whether a shower is installed over the bath. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3740:2021 — minimum 150mm above bath rim for water-resistant wall finish. If shower-over-bath: full shower waterproofing and tiling requirements apply (1800mm minimum). AS 3958:2023 for installation. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not using silicone at the bath rim-to-tile junction — grout cracks as the bath flexes when filled, allowing water behind tiles. (2) Insufficient tiling height for a shower-over-bath — must meet shower wall requirements (1800mm minimum), not just bath requirements (150mm). (3) Not providing an access panel in a tiled bath apron — when plumbing maintenance is needed, tiles must be destroyed if no access point exists. (4) Not waterproofing behind a freestanding bath that has a wall-mounted shower/handshower above it. |

### B8. Feature Wall Tiling

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A section of bathroom wall tiled with a different tile type, size, pattern, or material than the main bathroom walls. Used to create a visual focal point. Common locations include the shower back wall, the wall behind the vanity, or a full wall behind a freestanding bath. |
| **What it involves** | Selecting a feature tile that complements the main tile. Planning the feature tile layout and its junction/transition with the main tile. Tiling the feature area. Managing thickness differences between the feature and main tiles (may require adhesive build-up or furring out the substrate). Potentially different grout type or colour for the feature area. |
| **Common feature tile types** | **Mosaics:** Hexagonal, penny round, fish scale, chevron — on mesh sheets. **Zellige / handmade tiles:** Irregular, artisan look. Require wider grout joints (3-5mm) to accommodate variation. **Marble / stone-look porcelain:** Bookmatched pairs for a dramatic veined statement. **Kit Kat / finger tiles:** 25x150mm or similar narrow format. **Textured / 3D tiles:** Tiles with a sculptural surface — create visual interest through light and shadow. **Pattern tiles (encaustic-look):** Decorative patterned tiles, often used as a bathroom floor feature or vanity wall accent. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — a design upgrade. Adds cost for the feature tile material, potential complexity in transition details, and possible labour premium for specialty tile types (handmade tiles, mosaics, 3D tiles require more skill and time). |
| **Compliance requirements** | Same as general wall tiling (AS 3958:2023). If in the shower area, waterproofing requirements per AS 3740:2021 apply. If the feature tile is natural stone, it may require sealing before and after installation. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Feature tile significantly thicker or thinner than main tile — creates an ugly step at the transition. Plan substrate furring or adhesive build-up to achieve a flush surface. (2) Not ordering enough feature tile — specialty tiles often have long lead times and limited production runs. Order 15-20% overage. (3) Incompatible grout between feature and main tiles — use consistent grout across the bathroom where possible, or ensure the colour match is acceptable. (4) Feature wall in a location not visible from the bathroom entry — the visual impact is lost. Position feature walls opposite the entry door. |

### B9. Tile-Insert Floor Waste Grates

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A floor waste drain with a removable tile tray that accepts a cut piece of the floor tile, creating a near-invisible drain that blends with the tiled floor. Available as square point drains (typically 100x100mm or 120x120mm) and linear/channel drains (900mm, 1000mm, 1200mm, or custom lengths, typically 120mm wide). |
| **What it involves** | The plumber installs the floor waste body (drain housing) during the plumbing rough-in stage. The waterproofer integrates the puddle flange with the waterproof membrane. The tiler cuts a tile piece to fit inside the removable tile tray (typically 10mm deep to accommodate standard floor tile thickness) and adheres it in place. The tile tray is then placed into the drain body. The result is a floor surface where the drain is barely visible — the tile pattern continues across the drain with only a narrow gap (2-3mm) around the tray edge. |
| **Typical specifications** | **Square point drain:** 100x100mm or 120x120mm external dimensions. 80mm or 50mm pipe outlet (matching the plumber's waste pipe). 316 marine-grade stainless steel for wet areas (corrosion resistance). Tile tray depth: 10mm (accepts standard 8-10mm floor tiles plus adhesive). **Linear drain (channel drain):** 120mm wide. Lengths: 600mm, 900mm, 1000mm, 1200mm, 1500mm. 316 stainless steel or brushed/matte black finish. Tile tray depth: 10mm. Fall within the channel toward the outlet. Typically installed along one wall of the shower. **Finishes:** Polished stainless steel, brushed stainless steel, matte black, brushed brass, gun metal — to match tapware and bathroom hardware. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL but increasingly standard** — tile-insert drains are now the expected standard in mid-to-high-end Australian bathroom renovations. Traditional visible grates (round or square with slots/holes) are still used in budget renovations. The scope should specify the drain type. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Must comply with Australian plumbing standards (AS/NZS 3500.2) for drainage. Must integrate with the waterproof membrane via a puddle flange per AS 3740:2021. The tile tray must be removable for drain cleaning and maintenance. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Ordering the wrong drain size for the plumber's waste pipe (e.g., 80mm outlet drain with a 50mm pipe, or vice versa). (2) Tile tray too shallow for the chosen floor tile thickness — if the tile is 12mm thick and the tray is 10mm deep, the tile sits proud of the floor surface. (3) Not cutting the tile insert piece accurately — a sloppy cut is highly visible against the surrounding floor tile. (4) Not leaving a gap around the tray edge — the tray must be removable for maintenance. A 2-3mm gap is standard. (5) Incorrect fall to the drain — even with a tile-insert drain, the floor must fall correctly to the drain location. (6) Choosing a linear drain but not coordinating its position with the tiler — the drain must align with the tile grid to avoid awkward cuts. |

## C. Laundry Renovation

Laundry tiling in Australia is less extensive than bathroom tiling. The laundry is classified differently under AS 3740:2021 — it requires water-resistant flooring but does not require full waterproofing unless a floor waste is present. Wall tiling is typically limited to a splashback behind the laundry tub and washing machine.

---

### C1. Laundry Floor Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the laundry floor. The laundry floor must be water-resistant per NCC requirements. Tiles are one of the most popular floor materials for Australian laundries due to their durability and water resistance. |
| **What it involves** | Substrate preparation (concrete slab or sheet flooring over timber frame). Levelling if required. Waterproofing the floor if a floor waste is present (per AS 3740:2021). If no floor waste, waterproofing is not mandatory on a concrete slab — tiles can be laid directly with standard adhesive. On a timber subfloor, a waterproof membrane or water-resistant underlayment is recommended regardless. Tiling, grouting, and silicone at perimeters. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **300x300mm or 450x450mm ceramic/porcelain:** Standard, cost-effective. **600x600mm porcelain:** Modern look, fewer grout lines. **Timber-look porcelain planks:** Popular to match adjoining living areas. Tiles should be durable (PEI rating 3 or above) and easy to clean. |
| **Slip resistance** | **P3 (R10) minimum recommended.** Laundry floors are exposed to water spills from the washing machine, tub, and general cleaning. While not mandated by the BCA for residential laundries, P3 is sensible industry practice. |
| **Waterproofing** | **With floor waste:** Full waterproofing required per AS 3740:2021. The floor must be waterproofed, and wall-floor junctions must be waterproofed with a horizontal leg of not less than 40mm. **Without floor waste (concrete slab):** Waterproofing is not required per NCC. However, water-resistant flooring is still required. Tiles on a concrete slab satisfy this requirement. **Without floor waste (timber subfloor):** A waterproof membrane over the timber subfloor is recommended to protect the timber from moisture damage, even though not strictly mandated. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — laundry floor tiling is included in most laundry renovations. Alternative floor materials (vinyl, hybrid) are also common. |
| **Compliance requirements** | NCC Part 10.2 (wet area waterproofing — if floor waste present). AS 3958:2023 for tile installation. Water-resistant flooring is required by NCC for laundries. If waterproofed, the membrane must extend up walls adjacent to the laundry tub to 150mm above the tub rim for the width of the tub (where the tub is within 75mm of the wall). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Assuming the laundry floor needs full waterproofing when there is no floor waste — check whether a floor waste exists or is being installed. (2) Not waterproofing when a floor waste IS present — this is a code violation. (3) Not extending waterproofing up the wall behind the washing machine and tub when required. (4) Using non-slip-rated tiles — laundry floors get wet regularly. |

---

### C2. Laundry Splashback Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the wall area behind the laundry benchtop, tub, and washing machine. Protects the wall from water splashing and moisture. Functionally identical to a kitchen splashback. |
| **What it involves** | Tiling from the benchtop surface to the underside of any overhead cabinets (typically 600mm height, same as kitchen). If there are no overhead cabinets, tiling to a minimum of 150mm above the tub rim is required by NCC, though tiling to 600-900mm is standard practice for aesthetics and protection. |
| **Typical specifications** | Often matches the bathroom tiles for a cohesive home aesthetic, or uses a simple, cost-effective tile (white subway is extremely common for laundry splashbacks in Australia). Tile sizes: subway (75x150mm, 100x300mm), 300x600mm, or mosaics. Grout: cement-based grout is generally acceptable for laundry splashbacks (lower moisture exposure than bathroom). Epoxy grout is optional but unnecessary for most laundry applications. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — included in virtually all laundry renovations where a benchtop or tub is present. |
| **Compliance requirements** | NCC — walls adjacent to laundry tubs must have a water-resistant finish to a minimum of 150mm above the fixture. Substrate: cement sheet (Villaboard) recommended behind splashbacks. AS 3958:2023 for installation. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Only tiling to the minimum 150mm — this is code minimum but looks unfinished and provides minimal protection. Tile to 600mm minimum or to overhead cabinets. (2) Not extending the splashback behind the washing machine area — splashing during load/unload is common. (3) Using plasterboard substrate behind the splashback — cement sheet is far more durable against moisture. |

---

### C3. Laundry Wall Tiling (Extended)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling laundry walls beyond the splashback area — to half height (1200mm) or full height (floor to ceiling). This is an optional upgrade that provides a fully waterproof, easy-to-clean laundry interior. |
| **What it involves** | Same process as bathroom wall tiling — cement sheet substrate, adhesive, tiles, grout, silicone at internal corners and perimeters. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — a design/functionality upgrade. Most laundry renovations include only the splashback. Full or half-height wall tiling is specified when the homeowner wants a premium, fully tiled laundry. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023. Substrate must be cement sheet in areas below 1200mm (splash zone). Water-resistant plasterboard acceptable above 1200mm. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Tiling over standard plasterboard in the splash zone — moisture causes the board to deteriorate. (2) Not specifying the wall tiling height clearly in the scope. |

---

## D. Living Areas

Living area tiling (lounge, dining, hallway, entryway) in Australian renovations is primarily floor tiling. This is often the largest tiled area by square metre in a home. The key considerations are tile format (large format is dominant), porcelain vs ceramic performance characteristics, substrate preparation for flatness, and compatibility with underfloor heating if specified.

---

### D1. Living Area Floor Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the floor in living rooms, dining rooms, hallways, and entry areas. Large format porcelain tiles are the dominant choice in modern Australian living area renovations. Often forms part of an open-plan tiling scope that extends through the kitchen, dining, and living areas in one continuous tile surface. |
| **What it involves** | Removing existing floor covering. Substrate preparation — levelling the concrete slab or installing cement sheet over timber subfloor. Levelling is critical for large format tiles. Applying adhesive (medium-bed for large format), back-buttering tiles where required. Setting tiles using a tile levelling system (clips and wedges) to minimise lippage. Grouting. Silicone at all perimeter junctions. Transition strips at doorways where tiles meet other floor materials. Movement joints at specified intervals. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **600x600mm porcelain:** The baseline "large format" size. Popular, cost-effective, and suitable for most rooms. **600x1200mm porcelain:** The most popular living area tile size in Australia (2024-2026). Dramatic, fewer grout lines. Requires meticulous substrate flatness and back-buttering. **800x800mm porcelain:** Less common but available. **900x900mm or 1200x1200mm:** Premium large format. Requires two-person installation, suction cups, and expert-level substrate preparation. **Timber-look porcelain planks:** 200x1000mm, 200x1200mm. Extremely popular — provides the look and warmth of timber with the durability and ease-of-maintenance of porcelain. Typically laid in a brick bond pattern with 1/3 offset. **Natural stone (marble, travertine, limestone, slate):** Premium option. Requires sealing before and after installation. More maintenance than porcelain. |
| **Substrate flatness** | For large format tiles (any side longer than 400mm), the substrate must be flat to within **3mm over 3 metres** (per AS 3958:2023 recommendations and industry best practice). For tiles over 600mm on any side, flatness should be within **2mm over 2 metres**. Self-levelling compound is typically required on concrete slabs to achieve this tolerance. On timber subfloors, cement sheet overlay (6mm minimum) must be fixed to the joists with joints taped and filled. Any unevenness results in visible lippage (one tile edge sitting higher than the adjacent tile). |
| **Tile levelling systems** | **Essential for large format tile installation.** These systems consist of clips that are placed between tiles and wedges that are driven in to force adjacent tiles flush. They hold the tiles level while the adhesive cures. Common brands in Australia: Precise Levelling System, DTA, Raimondi, and various clip-and-wedge systems. The cost of levelling system consumables (clips are single-use, wedges are reusable) should be included in the tiling scope. |
| **Layout and pattern** | **Brick bond (1/3 offset):** Most common for rectangular tiles (600x1200mm, timber-look planks). **Note:** AS 3958:2023 recommends a maximum 1/3 offset for large format rectangular tiles (not the traditional 1/2 offset used for brick bond) to minimise lippage caused by tile bow/warpage. A 1/2 offset amplifies lippage. **Stack bond (grid):** Used for square tiles (600x600mm). **Herringbone:** Used for timber-look planks. Labour premium 20-30%. Tile overage 15-20%. |
| **Movement joints** | Required per AS 3958:2023, Section 5.4.7. **Internal floors:** Movement joints at maximum **4.5m** spacing in each direction. At all perimeters (wall-floor junctions — filled with silicone, not grout). Where tiles meet other materials or fixed elements (columns, stairs, door frames). Where the building has structural movement joints — these must be carried through the tiled surface. Minimum movement joint width: **6mm**. Filled with a flexible silicone sealant, not grout. Movement joints are not optional — they are a code requirement to prevent tile cracking and adhesive failure caused by building movement, thermal expansion, and substrate shrinkage. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — when the homeowner has chosen tiles as their living area floor material. The scope must specify the exact area to be tiled (room dimensions or square metre measurement). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023 for installation. Adhesive coverage: 90-100% for floor tiles. No voids around tile edges. Back-buttering required for tiles over 400x400mm. Movement joints at 4.5m maximum spacing. Transition strips at junctions with other floor materials must comply with accessibility requirements if applicable. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not levelling the substrate adequately — the single biggest cause of lippage in large format tile installations. A self-levelling compound pour is almost always required. (2) Using 1/2 offset with large format rectangular tiles — amplifies the lippage effect of any tile bow. Use 1/3 offset maximum. (3) Not back-buttering large format tiles — insufficient adhesive coverage causes hollow spots (tiles "drum" when tapped). (4) Skipping tile levelling systems — lippage is visible and ugly, and clients will reject the work. (5) Forgetting movement joints — tiles will crack, especially in large open-plan areas. (6) Not planning the tile layout from the main entry point or focal point — layout should minimise thin slivers at walls and ensure symmetry at visual focal points (fireplace, main entry). (7) Not allowing for transition strips at doorways — especially where tile meets carpet, timber, or vinyl at different heights. |

### D2. Porcelain vs Ceramic Tiles — Scope Implications

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Understanding the difference between porcelain and ceramic tiles is critical for scope specification. They have different performance characteristics, installation requirements, and cost implications. |
| **Manufacturing difference** | **Ceramic tiles:** Made from coarser clay, fired at lower temperatures (1000-1100 degrees C). Water absorption rate: typically 3-7% (above 0.5%). **Porcelain tiles:** Made from finer clay (kaolin), fired at higher temperatures (over 1200 degrees C) under greater pressure. Water absorption rate: less than 0.5% (per ASTM standards and AS 4459.3 testing). This is the definitive technical difference. |
| **Durability** | Porcelain is significantly harder and more durable. PEI rating 5 (highest) for most porcelain. Ceramic ranges from PEI 1 to PEI 4. Porcelain is more resistant to chipping, scratching, and wear. For high-traffic living areas, porcelain is the recommended choice. |
| **Water absorption** | Porcelain's low water absorption (<0.5%) makes it suitable for wet areas, outdoor use, and areas subject to freeze-thaw cycles. Ceramic's higher absorption (3-7%) makes it unsuitable for outdoor use and less ideal for high-moisture areas. **Scope implication:** If the tiling area is outdoor or a wet area, porcelain must be specified. Ceramic is acceptable for dry interior walls and low-traffic floors. |
| **Cutting and installation** | Porcelain is harder to cut than ceramic — requires a quality wet saw with a diamond blade rated for porcelain. Ceramic can be scored and snapped with a manual tile cutter. **Scope implication:** Porcelain installation may carry a slight labour premium due to cutting difficulty, especially for complex patterns or numerous cuts. |
| **Cost** | Porcelain tiles are typically 20-50% more expensive than equivalent ceramic tiles. Porcelain: $50-$100/m2 for the tile product. Ceramic: $35-$95/m2 for the tile product. (These are tile material costs; labour is additional.) |
| **Scope recommendation** | **For floors (especially living areas, kitchens, bathrooms):** Specify **porcelain**. Its durability, low water absorption, and high PEI rating make it the professional choice. **For walls (especially internal walls, splashbacks):** Ceramic is acceptable and cost-effective. Walls do not bear foot traffic, so the lower durability of ceramic is not a concern. **For outdoor:** Always specify **porcelain** (external-rated, see Section E). Ceramic is not suitable for outdoor use. |

---

### D3. Rectified vs Non-Rectified Tiles — Scope Implications

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Rectified and non-rectified tiles differ in their edge finish, which directly affects grout joint width and the overall aesthetic of the installation. |
| **Rectified tiles** | After firing, the tile edges are precision-cut (ground) by machine to produce perfectly straight, square edges. All tiles in a batch are exactly the same size. Allows for tight grout joints (1.5-2.5mm). Produces a clean, minimal-grout aesthetic. More expensive due to the additional manufacturing step. Most large-format porcelain tiles sold in Australia are rectified. |
| **Non-rectified tiles** | Tile edges are as they come out of the mould/kiln. Minor size variations exist between individual tiles (typically +/- 1-2mm). Require wider grout joints (3-5mm) to accommodate the size variation. More rustic or traditional aesthetic. Subway tiles and handmade tiles are often non-rectified. Generally less expensive than rectified equivalents. |
| **Grout joint width** | **Rectified:** 1.5-2.5mm. Industry standard is 2mm for floor tiles and 1.5mm for wall tiles. **Non-rectified:** 3-5mm. Industry standard is 3mm. The Australian Standard AS 3958:2023 recommends: 1.5mm minimum for dust-pressed wall tiles, 3mm for dust-pressed floor tiles, and 6mm for extruded tiles. These are minimums — the joint must be wide enough to accommodate the tile's manufacturing size tolerance. |
| **Scope implication** | The scope should specify whether tiles are rectified or non-rectified, as this determines the grout joint width and affects the quantity of grout required. Tight grout joints (rectified tiles) require more precise installation and are less forgiving of substrate unevenness or tile warpage. The tiler's quote may differ for rectified vs non-rectified tiles due to the precision required. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Specifying a 1.5mm grout joint on non-rectified tiles — the size variation between tiles makes this impossible, resulting in uneven joints. (2) Using rectified tiles with 5mm grout joints — wastes the visual benefit of rectified edges (the tight joint is the whole point). (3) Not informing the tiler whether the tiles are rectified or non-rectified — the tiler needs to know to set up spacers correctly. |

### D4. Underfloor Heating Compatibility

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | When electric underfloor heating mats are installed beneath tiled floors, the tiling scope must account for the heating system. Tiles are the ideal floor finish for underfloor heating because they conduct heat efficiently. This applies to living areas, bathrooms, kitchens, and any tiled floor. |
| **What it involves** | The electrician installs the electric heating mat (a thin, self-adhesive mesh with embedded heating cables, typically 3mm thick) over the substrate. The tiler then tiles directly over the heating mat using a modified thin-set adhesive (flexible, heat-resistant adhesive rated for underfloor heating use). The tile adhesive embeds the heating mat and bonds the tiles to the substrate. Total added floor height: 3-6mm for the mat (depending on adhesive build-up). |
| **Heating mat specifications** | Heat output: **150W/m2** for living areas, **200W/m2** for bathrooms (Australian standard). Mat thickness: approximately 3mm. Must be installed on a primed, clean substrate. Must be connected to an RCD-protected circuit by a licensed electrician. Thermostat sensor wire must be embedded in the adhesive between heating cables. |
| **Tile compatibility** | **Ceramic and porcelain tiles:** Fully compatible. Standard thickness (8-12mm) is ideal. **Natural stone:** Compatible but slower to heat due to greater thermal mass. Typically 10-15mm thick. **Large format tiles:** Compatible, but the additional adhesive bed (embedding the mat plus bonding the tile) means a slightly thicker overall build-up. **Important:** The tile adhesive used over underfloor heating mats must be flexible (S1 or S2 classification per EN 12002) to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction. Standard rigid adhesive will crack. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — underfloor heating is a comfort upgrade, not a tiling requirement. The scope must specify whether underfloor heating is included, as it affects adhesive selection, floor build-up height, and coordination with the electrician. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Electrical installation by licensed electrician. Heating mat must comply with AS/NZS 60335.2.96 (underfloor heating systems). Tile adhesive must be suitable for use with underfloor heating (flexible, heat-rated). The heating mat must be fully embedded in adhesive — no air pockets. The system must not be energised until the adhesive has fully cured (typically 14-28 days per adhesive manufacturer instructions). |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using rigid (non-flexible) adhesive over the heating mat — the adhesive cracks with thermal cycling, tiles delaminate. (2) Turning the heating on before the adhesive has fully cured — can cause adhesive failure. Most systems require 14-28 days cure time before first use. (3) Damaging the heating mat cables during tile installation — a severed cable means the entire mat fails. The tiler must use extreme care when applying adhesive and setting tiles. (4) Not embedding the thermostat sensor correctly — it must be placed between heating cables, not directly on top of a cable, for accurate temperature reading. (5) Not accounting for the added floor height (3-6mm) — this affects transition strips at doorways and clearance under doors. |

## E. Outdoor / Alfresco

Outdoor tiling in Australia must withstand UV exposure, temperature variation, rain, and (in some areas) salt spray. The standards and material specifications are significantly more demanding than interior tiling. All outdoor tiling must be over a waterproof membrane (AS 4654.2 for above-ground external waterproofing), and materials must be rated for external use.

---

### E1. Patio / Alfresco Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the floor of a covered or uncovered patio, alfresco, verandah, or outdoor entertaining area. This is the most common outdoor tiling scope item in Australian renovations. |
| **What it involves** | Substrate preparation (concrete slab — must be structurally sound, level, and have adequate falls for drainage). Waterproofing the slab with an external-grade membrane (AS 4654.2). Tiling with external-rated tiles using flexible, external-grade adhesive. Grouting with external-grade grout. Movement joints at specified intervals and at all perimeter junctions. |
| **Tile material requirements** | **Porcelain ONLY** for outdoor tiling — ceramic tiles are not suitable due to their higher water absorption rate (>0.5%). Water absorption causes deterioration, spalling, and cracking over time, especially with temperature cycling. **Water absorption: <0.5%** (porcelain classification). **Frost resistance:** Not typically an issue in most of coastal Australia, but relevant for elevated/alpine regions and parts of southern Victoria, Tasmania, and the ACT. Low water absorption porcelain is inherently frost resistant. **UV resistance:** Porcelain is UV stable — colours do not fade. **Salt resistance:** Important in coastal areas. Porcelain with low porosity resists salt crystallisation damage. Specify "salt pool grade" or "marine grade" porcelain for pool surrounds or coastal installations. |
| **Common tile types and sizes** | **20mm porcelain pavers:** The premium standard for outdoor tiling. 20mm thick (vs standard 10mm interior tiles). Extremely durable — can withstand heavy furniture, foot traffic, and weather. Available in 600x600mm, 600x1200mm, and 600x900mm. Can be installed with adhesive on a slab (like standard tiles) or on a pedestal system (see E5). **Standard porcelain (10mm):** Acceptable for covered patios with lighter use. Must be external-rated. **Timber-look porcelain planks:** Popular for alfresco areas. Must be external-rated with appropriate slip resistance. **Natural stone (granite, bluestone, sandstone):** Premium option. Requires sealing. Ensure it is rated for external use and slip resistance. |
| **Slip resistance** | **Minimum P4 (R11)** for outdoor areas. Outdoor areas are exposed to rain, garden hose water, and morning dew. P4/R11 is the minimum for safe use. **P5 (R12)** recommended for areas exposed to heavy water (pool surrounds, uncovered patios in high-rainfall areas). Most 20mm porcelain pavers have a textured surface and meet P4 or P5. |
| **Drainage** | Outdoor tiled areas must have adequate surface fall for water drainage: **Minimum 1:100 (1%) fall** away from the building and toward garden, drainage grates, or stormwater. If the outdoor area adjoins an internal floor (e.g., alfresco connected to living room via sliding doors), the outdoor tile surface must be **at least 50mm below the internal floor level** (per NCC) to prevent water ingress. |
| **Standard or optional** | **STANDARD** — when the homeowner is tiling an outdoor area. The scope must specify the area dimensions and whether the area is covered or uncovered (this affects material selection and waterproofing requirements). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023 (tile installation). AS 4654.2 (external waterproofing — for above-ground surfaces). External-rated adhesive (flexible, C2S1 minimum classification). Adhesive coverage: 90% minimum for external floor tiles. Movement joints at maximum **3m centres** for external installations (more frequent than internal due to greater thermal expansion). Minimum 6mm joint width for movement joints. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using ceramic tiles or interior-rated porcelain for outdoor installation — they absorb water, crack, and fail within 1-3 years. (2) Insufficient drainage fall — water pools on the tiled surface, creating slip hazards and accelerating deterioration. (3) Not waterproofing the slab — water penetrates through the slab, causing efflorescence (white salt deposits on the tile surface) and structural damage. (4) Using rigid adhesive instead of flexible external-grade adhesive — thermal expansion/contraction causes delamination. (5) Insufficient movement joints — outdoor tiles experience greater thermal movement than interior tiles. Joints must be at 3m maximum centres. (6) Not maintaining the 50mm step-down from internal floor level — water can flow into the house during heavy rain. |

---

### E2. Pool Surround Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the area around a swimming pool — the pool coping, the paved surround (deck), and any associated step or planter tiling. Pool surrounds are one of the most demanding outdoor tiling applications due to the combination of water exposure, chemical exposure (chlorine, salt), UV, and the critical safety requirement for slip resistance. |
| **What it involves** | Tiling the pool coping (the edge tiles that cap the pool shell wall and overhang the water — often a bullnose or drop-face profile). Tiling the pool surround deck area. Ensuring all tiles are pool-grade (chemical resistant, salt resistant, UV stable, high slip resistance). Waterproofing the substrate. Using pool-grade adhesive and grout. |
| **Material requirements** | **Porcelain only** — with water absorption <0.5%. Must be specifically rated for pool use: **chlorine resistant** (saltwater pools generate chlorine through salt chlorination, which is aggressive to some materials), **salt resistant** (resists salt crystallisation damage — critical for saltwater pools), **UV stable** (no colour fading), **low porosity** (resists chemical absorption and staining). **20mm porcelain pavers** are ideal for pool surrounds. Some natural stones (granite, bluestone) are suitable if properly sealed and rated for pool use. Avoid limestone and sandstone near pools — they are porous and susceptible to chemical damage. |
| **Slip resistance** | **Minimum P4 (R11)** for pool surrounds. **P5 (R12) recommended** for areas immediately adjacent to the pool edge and any ramps or steps. The pool coping edge must have high slip resistance — it is the area where people exit the pool with wet feet. Textured finishes are essential — never use polished or honed tiles near a pool. |
| **Pool coping** | The coping tile is the edge tile that sits on top of the pool shell wall. It typically has a rounded or bullnose front edge that overhangs the pool water by 25-50mm. Coping tiles are available as purpose-made pool coping pieces (with a factory-finished rounded edge and drip groove on the underside). Alternatively, standard 20mm pavers can be used with a bullnose edge profile cut on site (though factory coping pieces are preferred for consistency and safety). |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — only applicable when the renovation includes a pool area. The scope must specify the pool surround area (m2), coping linear metres, and whether the pool is chlorine or saltwater (affects material selection). |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 3958:2023, AS 4654.2 (external waterproofing), AS 4586:2013 (slip resistance). Pool coping and surrounds must comply with AS 1926.1 (Swimming Pool Safety) for any fencing and barrier integration. Pool surround drainage must fall away from the pool edge at minimum 1:100 gradient toward garden or drainage. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using tiles not rated for pool/salt environments — salt crystallisation causes tiles to spall and crack within 1-3 years. (2) Insufficient slip resistance on pool coping — extremely dangerous as this is where people stand with wet feet at the pool edge. (3) Pool surround falling toward the pool — dirty runoff water flows into the pool. The surround should fall away from the pool. (4) Not using pool-grade adhesive and grout — standard products degrade under chemical and water exposure. (5) Coping tiles not properly adhered — they are subjected to people sitting on them, stepping on them when wet, and thermal cycling. Adhesive coverage must be 100%. |

---

### E3. Step / Stair Tiling (Outdoor)

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling outdoor steps and stairs — including risers (vertical face), treads (horizontal surface), and the critical stair nosing (front edge of the tread). Outdoor stair tiling has specific safety requirements under Australian Standards, particularly for the stair nosing which must provide high slip resistance and visual contrast. |
| **What it involves** | Tiling the tread surface (horizontal) and riser face (vertical) of each step. Installing an anti-slip stair nosing on the front edge of each tread. The tread surface must have a slight fall (toward the front edge) for drainage. All tiles must be external-rated porcelain. |
| **Stair nosing requirements** | Per **AS 1428.1:2021** (Design for Access and Mobility) and NCC requirements: the stair nosing must have a **luminance contrast strip** of at least 50mm depth on the tread and 30mm on the riser to provide visual identification of the step edge. This is typically achieved with a dedicated stair nosing profile — an aluminium extrusion with an anti-slip insert (carborundum or rubber) that is fixed to the front edge of each tread. **Slip resistance:** Stair nosings must achieve **P5 (R12)** — the highest slip resistance classification. This is the only area in residential construction where the BCA/NCC mandates specific slip ratings. **Anti-slip stair nosing products** are available from Australian suppliers (Stair Nosing Australia, Classic Architectural, Safety Xpress) in aluminium with various insert materials and finishes. |
| **Tread specifications** | Tread tiles must be external-rated porcelain with minimum P4 (R11) slip resistance. Tread surface should fall approximately 1:100 toward the front edge for drainage. Tile must be cut to fit the tread depth precisely — overhang beyond the nosing profile is not acceptable. |
| **Riser specifications** | Riser tiles can be the same tile as the tread or a contrasting tile. No slip resistance requirement for risers (vertical surface). Tile cut to match the riser height (typically 150-190mm per NCC stair dimension requirements). |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — required when outdoor steps are being tiled. The scope must specify the number of steps, dimensions, and nosing type. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 1428.1:2021 (stair nosing luminance contrast). NCC stair dimension requirements (riser height, tread depth, uniformity). AS 4586:2013 (slip resistance — P5 for stair nosings). AS 3958:2023 for tile installation. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not installing anti-slip stair nosings — this is a safety and compliance failure. Tiled stair edges without nosings are extremely slippery when wet. (2) Stair nosing not providing luminance contrast — the nosing must be visually distinct from the tread tile to identify the step edge. (3) Water pooling on treads — treads must fall toward the front edge for drainage. (4) Inconsistent riser heights — NCC requires consistent riser height across all steps (maximum 5mm variation). The tile thickness must be factored into the step construction to maintain uniformity. |

### E4. Balcony Tiling

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tiling the floor of a balcony — a suspended outdoor area (not on ground level). Balcony tiling is one of the most technically demanding tiling applications due to the combination of waterproofing requirements, structural loading, drainage, and the critical need to prevent water ingress to the building interior below. |
| **What it involves** | Waterproofing the balcony slab with an external-grade membrane system complying with AS 4654.2. Applying screed with adequate falls for drainage. Tiling with external-rated porcelain using flexible adhesive. Movement joints at specified intervals. Ensuring proper drainage (primary and overflow/secondary drainage outlets). Maintaining the required step-down from the internal floor level. |
| **Waterproofing requirements** | **AS 4654.2** governs external waterproofing for balconies. The waterproof membrane must: extend under all drainage flanges and up all turn-ups; extend a minimum of **25mm above the finished floor height** at door sills; be compatible with the tiling system applied over it; be applied by a licensed waterproofer and certified. **The 50mm step-down:** The balcony finished floor level must be at least **50mm below the adjacent internal floor level** per NCC, to prevent water flowing into the building during heavy rain. Some states (notably NSW since 2025) have strengthened balcony waterproofing regulations significantly. |
| **Drainage requirements** | **Primary drainage:** The balcony surface must fall at a minimum of **1:100 (1%)** toward the drainage outlet. The fall must be away from the building (toward the balcony edge or designated drain). **Secondary (overflow) drainage:** A backup drainage outlet must be provided in case the primary drain blocks. This is typically a scupper (opening in the balcony edge or upstand) set at a height above the primary drain. **All balconies must have both primary and secondary drainage** per AS 4654.2 and NCC requirements. |
| **Tile material** | Same as patio tiling (Section E1): external-rated porcelain with <0.5% water absorption. 20mm porcelain pavers are ideal, especially on a pedestal system (see E5) which allows drainage beneath the tiles. Standard 10mm external porcelain on adhesive is also acceptable. |
| **Pedestal system option** | 20mm porcelain pavers can be installed on adjustable pedestals (10-550mm height range) rather than adhered directly to the slab. The tiles sit on the pedestals with open joints — water drains through the gaps between tiles, runs across the waterproof membrane, and exits via the primary drain. Benefits: easy access to the membrane for inspection and repair; tiles are replaceable individually; accommodates uneven slab falls; creates a ventilated air gap reducing heat transfer. This is increasingly popular for Australian balcony renovations. |
| **Standard or optional** | **CONDITIONAL** — required when a balcony is being tiled or re-tiled. The scope must specify the balcony dimensions, drainage locations, and whether adhesive-fixed or pedestal-system tiles are used. |
| **Compliance requirements** | AS 4654.2 (external waterproofing). AS 3958:2023 (tile installation). NCC Part 3.8.1 (wet areas and external waterproofing). Movement joints at **3m maximum centres** for external installations. The waterproofer and tiler should ideally be the same company or closely coordinated — incompatible membrane and adhesive systems are a leading cause of balcony waterproofing failure. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Not providing secondary (overflow) drainage — if the primary drain blocks, water accumulates on the balcony and eventually enters the building. (2) Insufficient fall — water ponds on the balcony surface, degrading the waterproof membrane and tiles over time. (3) Not maintaining the 50mm step-down from the internal floor — water ingress to the building interior is the most common and expensive balcony defect in Australian apartments. (4) Using incompatible membrane and adhesive systems — the adhesive must bond to the membrane without degrading it. Always use products from the same manufacturer's system or verify compatibility. (5) Not enough movement joints — external tiles experience significant thermal expansion. Joints at 3m centres maximum. (6) Waterproof membrane not extending high enough at door sills — minimum 25mm above finished floor level. |

---

### E5. Porcelain Paver Pedestal System

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A raised paver system where 20mm porcelain tiles are supported on adjustable plastic pedestals rather than adhered to the substrate. The tiles sit on the pedestals with open joints (typically 3-5mm), creating a raised, ventilated surface that allows water to drain through to the waterproof membrane below. Used for balconies, rooftop terraces, patios, and pool surrounds. |
| **What it involves** | Waterproofing the substrate (slab). Installing the drainage system (the membrane surface acts as the drainage plane, with falls directing water to outlets). Placing adjustable pedestals at each tile corner intersection. Setting 20mm porcelain pavers on the pedestals. Adjusting pedestal heights to achieve a level surface (pedestals compensate for up to 5% floor gradient). No adhesive or grout is required. Tiles can be individually lifted for membrane inspection, repair, or replacement. |
| **Pedestal specifications** | **Height range:** 10mm to 550mm+ (adjustable by screwing the pedestal body). **Head diameter:** Typically 120-200mm. **Load capacity:** 400-1000kg per pedestal (depends on brand). **Slope compensation:** Most pedestals have a slope-correcting head that compensates for up to 5% (3 degrees) of substrate fall — the tile surface can be level even if the slab slopes. **Brands available in Australia:** Elmich VersiPave, KEKSIA, Buzon, Eterno. **Material:** UV-stabilised polypropylene (recyclable). |
| **20mm paver specifications** | 20mm thick porcelain tiles, also called "2cm pavers." **Sizes:** 600x600mm (most common), 600x1200mm, 600x900mm. **Weight:** Approximately 48-50 kg/m2 (including pedestal system). **Edge profile:** Square-cut (not rectified edge — the open joints mean edge precision is less critical than for adhered tiles). **Slip resistance:** P4 (R11) minimum for outdoor use. Most 20mm pavers have a textured surface achieving P4 or P5. |
| **Advantages over adhered tiling** | No adhesive or grout required — faster installation. Tiles are individually removable for membrane inspection/repair. Drainage is inherent — water falls through the open joints. Ventilated air gap reduces heat transfer to the slab. Lighter overall system weight (important for suspended slabs and balconies). Pedestal adjustment accommodates uneven substrates. |
| **Standard or optional** | **OPTIONAL** — an alternative to traditional adhered outdoor tiling. Preferred for balconies and rooftop terraces where membrane access is important. The scope must specify if a pedestal system is being used, as it affects the tiling methodology, material requirements, and cost structure. |
| **Compliance requirements** | Substrate waterproofing per AS 4654.2. Pedestal system must be compliant with NCC structural loading requirements for the specific application (balcony, rooftop). 20mm pavers must be external-rated with appropriate slip resistance. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using standard 10mm tiles on pedestals — they are not strong enough and will crack under load. 20mm minimum. (2) Not waterproofing the substrate — the pedestal system does not replace waterproofing; water runs under the pavers and must be managed by the membrane and drainage system. (3) Not providing adequate drainage falls on the membrane surface — water must flow to drains, not pool under the pavers. (4) Pedestal spacing too wide — pedestals must be at every tile corner. Missing pedestals cause tiles to flex and crack. (5) Not securing perimeter pavers — tiles at the edges (especially on balconies) may need additional securing to prevent wind uplift or displacement. |

## F. General Tiling Specifications (Cross-Room)

These specifications apply across all room types and should be referenced by the AI scope generator for any tiling scope.

---

### F1. Adhesive Types and Coverage Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Tile adhesive selection and coverage requirements per AS 3958:2023. The adhesive is the bond between the tile and the substrate — incorrect adhesive or insufficient coverage is a leading cause of tile failure. |
| **Adhesive types** | **C1 (Standard):** Cement-based adhesive for standard interior wall and floor tiling. Suitable for tiles up to approximately 400x400mm on prepared substrates. **C2 (Improved/Enhanced):** Higher bond strength cement-based adhesive. Required for large format tiles (>400x400mm), porcelain tiles, and tiles on substrates that may experience moisture or movement. Recommended for all wet area tiling. **C2S1 (Flexible):** C2 adhesive with S1 deformability classification. Required for external tiling, underfloor heating, and substrates that experience movement (timber subfloors). **C2S2 (Highly Flexible):** C2 adhesive with S2 (highly deformable) classification. Used for extreme movement scenarios (e.g., structural joints, highly flexible substrates). **Rapid-set variants:** Available in all classifications — shorter working time but faster setting. Useful when time is limited. |
| **Coverage requirements (AS 3958:2023)** | **Internal wall tiles (dry area):** Minimum 65% adhesive coverage. **Internal wall tiles (wet area):** Minimum 65% adhesive coverage (80-90% recommended by industry best practice). **Internal floor tiles:** Minimum 90% adhesive coverage, no voids around tile edges. **External wall tiles:** Minimum 90% adhesive coverage. **External floor tiles:** Minimum 90% adhesive coverage (100% target). **Back-buttering:** For tiles over 400x400mm, adhesive should be applied to both the substrate (combed with notched trowel) and the back of the tile (a thin "butter" coat). This ensures full coverage and eliminates voids. |
| **Notched trowel sizing** | **Tiles up to 300x300mm:** 6mm notched trowel on substrate. **Tiles 300x300mm to 400x400mm:** 10mm notched trowel on substrate. **Tiles over 400x400mm:** 12mm notched trowel on substrate, plus back-butter on the tile. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Using C1 (standard) adhesive for large format or porcelain tiles — insufficient bond strength. C2 minimum. (2) Not back-buttering large format tiles — leaves voids (hollow spots) that cause tiles to crack under load. (3) Using rigid adhesive on flexible substrates (timber floors, underfloor heating) — the adhesive cracks and tiles delaminate. Use C2S1 or C2S2. (4) Insufficient adhesive coverage in wet areas — voids allow water to track under tiles, degrading the system. (5) Not checking adhesive compatibility with the waterproof membrane — always verify with the membrane manufacturer. |

---

### F2. Substrate Preparation and Flatness

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | The substrate (the surface beneath the tiles) must be properly prepared to receive tiles. Substrate flatness directly determines tile lippage (the height difference between adjacent tile edges) — the flatter the substrate, the flatter the finished tile surface. |
| **Substrate types** | **Concrete slab:** Most common in Australian residential construction (slab-on-ground). Must be clean, free of loose material, cured (minimum 28 days for new concrete), and primed before tiling. Cracks in the slab must be addressed — a crack isolation membrane may be required. **Cement sheet (Villaboard, Hardiflex):** The standard substrate for wall tiling in wet areas. Minimum 6mm thick. Fixed to timber or steel framing with appropriate fasteners. Joints taped and filled. Must be primed before tiling. James Hardie rates 6mm Villaboard for tiles up to 9mm thick at a maximum weight of 30kg per tile. **Sand/cement screed:** Applied over concrete slabs or waterproof membranes to create falls (in showers and wet areas) or to level the substrate. Typically 20-40mm thick. Must cure for a minimum of 7 days per 10mm of thickness before tiling. **Self-levelling compound:** Applied over concrete slabs to achieve the flatness required for large format tiles. Poured and self-levels to within 1-2mm over 2 metres. Typically 3-10mm thick. |
| **Flatness tolerance** | **Standard tiles (up to 400x400mm):** Substrate should be flat to within **5mm over 3 metres** (AS 3958:2023 general recommendation). **Large format tiles (over 400mm on any side):** Substrate should be flat to within **3mm over 3 metres**. Industry best practice for tiles 600mm+ is **2mm over 2 metres**. Self-levelling compound is almost always required to achieve this tolerance on Australian residential concrete slabs. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Tiling directly on an unprepared slab — dust, debris, curing agents, and surface contamination prevent adhesive bonding. (2) Not levelling the substrate before laying large format tiles — any dip or hump is amplified across the tile surface as lippage. (3) Not priming the substrate — the primer provides a consistent absorption rate and improves adhesive bond. (4) Tiling over a damp or uncured substrate — adhesive does not cure properly. (5) Not addressing slab cracks — cracks telegraph through the tile bed and crack the tiles above (a crack isolation membrane such as Mapei Mapeguard or Laticrete Strata Mat can bridge cracks). |

---

### F3. Movement Joints

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Movement joints (also called expansion joints or control joints) are compressible gaps in the tiled surface that allow for building movement, thermal expansion/contraction, and substrate shrinkage without cracking tiles or adhesive. They are a code requirement under AS 3958:2023, Section 5.4.7. |
| **Types of movement joints** | **Perimeter joints:** At all edges where tiles meet walls, columns, door frames, or other fixed elements. Filled with flexible silicone sealant. Width: minimum 6mm. **Intermediate joints:** Dividing large tiled areas into smaller panels. Filled with flexible silicone sealant or a compressible backer rod with silicone cap. Width: minimum 6mm. **Structural movement joints:** Where the building has designed structural joints (e.g., between building stages, at slab joints). These must be carried through the tiled surface — tiles must never bridge a structural joint. Covered with a proprietary movement joint profile or filled with a compressible joint sealant. |
| **Maximum spacing** | **Internal floors:** 4.5m maximum in each direction. **External floors:** 3m maximum in each direction (greater thermal movement outdoors). **Walls:** 3-4.5m depending on exposure and tile size. **All changes of plane** (e.g., wall-floor junction, internal corners) must have a movement joint (silicone, not grout). |
| **Standard or optional** | **MANDATORY** — movement joints are a code requirement under AS 3958:2023. They are not optional. The scope should include movement joint locations and the silicone sealant specification. |
| **Common mistakes** | (1) Omitting movement joints — the most common tiling defect in Australia. Without movement joints, tiles and adhesive crack as the building moves. (2) Using grout instead of silicone at perimeter joints and internal corners — grout is rigid and cracks at these locations. Silicone is mandatory. (3) Movement joints too narrow — minimum 6mm width is required to allow adequate compression. (4) Not carrying structural joints through the tile surface — tiles crack along the structural joint line. (5) Not including movement joints in the scope/quote — tilers who omit movement joints save time but produce a non-compliant installation. |

---

### F4. Grout Types and Selection

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Grout fills the joints between tiles, providing structural support to the tile edges, preventing water ingress behind tiles, and creating the finished aesthetic of the tiled surface. Grout type selection significantly affects the durability, appearance, and maintenance of the tiled surface. |
| **Cement-based grout** | **Composition:** Portland cement, sand (for sanded versions), and additives. **Joint width:** Sanded cement grout for joints 3mm and wider. Unsanded cement grout for joints under 3mm. **Properties:** Absorbs water (not waterproof). Stains easily. Requires sealing (initial seal after curing, then periodic re-sealing every 1-2 years). Relatively easy to work with and inexpensive. **Best for:** Dry interior areas (walls, living room floors), areas with minimal moisture exposure, budget-conscious projects. **Cost:** $15-$30 per 5kg bag (covers approximately 2-5m2 depending on tile size and joint width). |
| **Epoxy grout** | **Composition:** Epoxy resin and hardener (two-part system, no cement). **Joint width:** Available for all joint widths. **Properties:** Waterproof. Stain-proof. Chemical-resistant. Does not require sealing — ever. Extremely durable. Consistent colour. Mould and mildew resistant. **Downsides:** 3-5x more expensive than cement grout. Harder to work with — sets faster, requires more skill to apply cleanly. Some colours have a slight plastic/resin sheen (though modern formulations have improved). **Best for:** All wet areas (bathrooms, showers, kitchen splashbacks, laundries), pool areas, areas requiring hygiene (food preparation areas). **Cost:** $50-$100+ per 5kg unit (covers approximately 2-5m2). **Professional recommendation for Australian wet areas: epoxy grout.** |
| **Polymer-modified cement grout** | **Composition:** Cement grout with added polymer (either pre-mixed or requiring a liquid polymer additive). **Properties:** Better water resistance and flexibility than standard cement grout. Improved stain resistance. Still requires sealing but less frequently. **Best for:** A middle-ground option between standard cement and epoxy. Suitable for bathrooms and kitchens if budget is a concern. |
| **Scope implication** | The scope should specify the grout type for each area. A common specification is: epoxy grout for all wet areas (shower, bathroom floor, kitchen splashback) and polymer-modified cement grout for dry areas (living area floors, dry walls). The homeowner should be informed of the cost difference and maintenance implications. |

### F5. Tile Waste Percentages (Ordering Guide)

**Confidence: HIGH**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Additional tile quantity that must be ordered beyond the measured area to account for cutting waste, breakage, and future replacements. The waste percentage varies by layout pattern and room complexity. |
| **Waste percentages by pattern** | **Stack bond / grid:** 10% overage. **Brick bond / running bond:** 10% overage. **Herringbone:** 15-20% overage (extensive angled perimeter cuts). **Chevron:** 15-20% overage. **Diagonal (45-degree):** 12-15% overage. **Mosaics (sheet-mounted):** 10% overage. |
| **Additional factors** | **Small rooms (<5m2):** Add an extra 5% on top of the pattern-based overage (more perimeter cuts relative to area). **Rooms with many cut-outs (windows, niches, pipes, columns):** Add an extra 5%. **Natural stone tiles:** Add an extra 5% for potential defects/veining mismatches. **Spare tiles for future repairs:** Recommend keeping 2-4 spare tiles of each type for future crack replacements or matching. These should be stored on-site by the homeowner. |
| **Ordering formula** | **Total tiles to order = Measured area x (1 + waste percentage).** Example: 12m2 bathroom floor in brick bond = 12 x 1.10 = 13.2m2 order (round up to the next full box). Example: 8m2 splashback in herringbone = 8 x 1.20 = 9.6m2 order (round up to the next full box). Always order from the same batch/lot number to ensure colour consistency. Different production batches can have noticeable colour variation (called "shade variation"). |
