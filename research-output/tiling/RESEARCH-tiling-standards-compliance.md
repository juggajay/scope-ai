## 1. AS 3958 — Installation of Ceramic and Stone Tiles

**Current version:** AS 3958:2023 (replaces AS 3958.1-2007)
**Related standard:** AS 3958.2-1992 (Guide to the selection of a ceramic tiling system)
**Confidence:** HIGH (standard references cross-checked against HIA, ATCA, and industry sources)

AS 3958:2023 is the primary Australian Standard governing the installation of ceramic and stone tiles. It provides instructions on background preparation, bonded fixing, and grouting of floor and wall tiles including mosaic tiles and panels. It applies to all internal and external tile installations.

### 1.1 Substrate Preparation Requirements

The substrate (background) must be properly prepared before any tiling begins. This is a critical scope item.

| Requirement | Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Structural soundness** | Substrate must be structurally sound, with no loose material, drummy render, or cracked concrete that could compromise adhesion | HIGH |
| **Flatness tolerance** | Deviation under a 2m straightedge must not exceed 3-4mm from the required plane. Large-format tiles (600x600mm+) require even flatter substrates | HIGH |
| **Surface cleanliness** | Must be free from dust, oil, grease, curing agents, release agents, barrier films, old adhesives, and any other contaminants | HIGH |
| **Moisture content** | Substrate must have appropriate moisture content. Newly poured concrete requires minimum 28 days curing before tiling | HIGH |
| **Priming** | Highly porous substrates require priming per adhesive manufacturer's instructions to control suction and improve bond | MEDIUM |
| **Waterproofing in wet areas** | Where tiling is in wet areas, substrate must comply with AS 3740 before tiling commences. Waterproofing membrane must be certified before tiles are laid | HIGH |

**Acceptable substrate types:**

| Substrate | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Concrete** | Must be fully cured (28+ days), no excessive cracking, surface ground or scabbled if too smooth |
| **Sand/cement render** | Must be sound, not drummy or peeling, keyed surface for adhesion |
| **Cement sheet / fibre cement** | Must be appropriate thickness for application, fixed per manufacturer specs |
| **Plasterboard** | Only water-resistant plasterboard in wet areas. Standard plasterboard for dry wall tiling only |
| **Existing tiles** | Can tile over if existing tiles are sound, well-bonded, clean, and surface is prepared (diamond grinding or bonding agent) |
| **Timber / particleboard** | Requires adequate stiffness (deflection limits), typically needs fibre cement sheet overlay. Direct tiling to timber is high-risk |
| **Compressed sheet flooring** | Acceptable if structurally adequate and manufacturer allows tiling |

**Scope impact:** Every tiling scope MUST include a substrate preparation line item. If the substrate is out of tolerance, remedial work (screeding, levelling compound, grinding) must be scoped separately. The tiler should never be expected to tile over an unprepared or non-compliant substrate.

### 1.2 Adhesive Selection & Coverage Requirements

AS 3958 specifies minimum adhesive coverage based on the installation location. Insufficient coverage causes tile delamination, cracking, and water ingress.

**Adhesive coverage minimums (% of tile back covered):**

| Location | Minimum Coverage | Notes | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internal residential walls (dry) | 65% | Standard cement-based adhesive acceptable | HIGH |
| Internal residential floors (dry) | 80% | No voids around tile edges | HIGH |
| Wet areas (floors and walls) | 90% | No voids around edges. Back-buttering recommended | HIGH |
| Swimming pools | 90% | Specialist adhesive required | HIGH |
| External walls | 90% | Flexible adhesive required | HIGH |
| External floors, decks, roofs | 90% | Flexible adhesive, must accommodate thermal movement | HIGH |

**Adhesive types (classified per AS ISO 13007):**

| Type | Classification | Best For | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cementitious (C1)** | Standard cement-based, mixed with water | Internal dry-area wall and floor tiles on cement substrates | HIGH |
| **Cementitious (C2)** | Higher bond strength, performance modifiers (polymer-modified) | Wet areas, large-format tiles, external tiling, tiling over existing tiles, timber substrates | HIGH |
| **Dispersion (D)** | Ready-mixed paste, no cement | Light-duty internal wall tiles only. NOT for floors or wet areas | MEDIUM |
| **Epoxy/Reaction resin (R)** | Two-part chemical set | Commercial, high-moisture, chemical-resistant applications. Rarely needed in residential | MEDIUM |

**Application method:**

| Method | When Used | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Thin-bed (notched trowel)** | Standard method for most residential tiling. Adhesive applied to substrate with notched trowel, tile pressed into bed. Bed thickness typically 3-6mm | HIGH |
| **Back-buttering** | Required for large-format tiles (600x600mm+), textured-back tiles, natural stone, and all tiles in wet areas to achieve required coverage | HIGH |
| **Medium-bed** | Adhesive bed 6-15mm. Used where minor substrate irregularities need to be taken up without separate screeding | MEDIUM |
| **Thick-bed (sand/cement mortar)** | Traditional method. Mortar bed 10-40mm. Used for floor levelling, falls to drains, and where substrate is significantly out of tolerance | HIGH |

**Scope impact:** The adhesive type must be specified in the scope based on the tile type, substrate, and location. Wet area tiling always requires C2-class adhesive minimum. Large-format tiles require back-buttering as a separate labour consideration. The scope should note if thick-bed mortar is required for creating falls (e.g., shower floors), as this is significantly more labour and material than thin-bed.

### 1.3 Grouting Requirements

| Requirement | Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Grout types** | Cementitious (CG1, CG2 per AS ISO 13007) for most residential. Epoxy (RG) for high-moisture, high-chemical areas. CG2 is polymer-modified and preferred for wet areas | HIGH |
| **Joint width** | Must be consistent throughout installation. Minimum grout joint depends on tile type: rectified tiles typically 2-3mm, non-rectified 3-5mm. Natural stone may require wider joints | HIGH |
| **Joint filling** | Joints must be filled completely with no air pockets or voids | HIGH |
| **Curing** | Minimum 24-48 hours before heavy cleaning or water exposure. Full cure up to 7 days | MEDIUM |
| **Sealing** | Cementitious grout in wet areas and high-traffic areas should be sealed after full cure. Natural stone grout joints always sealed | MEDIUM |
| **Movement joints** | Grout must NOT be used in movement joints. Movement joints must be filled with flexible sealant (silicone or polyurethane) | HIGH |

**Scope impact:** Grout type and colour should be specified. Epoxy grout is significantly more expensive and labour-intensive than cementitious grout but is superior in showers and splashbacks. Grout sealing should be a separate line item if specified.

### 1.4 Tolerances and Finish Quality

| Tolerance | Specification | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Surface flatness** | Finished tiled surface: +/- 4mm in 2m from required plane | HIGH |
| **Lippage (tile-to-tile step)** | Maximum 1mm for tiles with edges <3mm joint width. Increases to 2mm for wider joints. Brick-bond (offset) patterns with large-format tiles should offset by max 30% (not 50%) to minimise lippage risk | HIGH |
| **Joint width consistency** | Joints must be visually consistent throughout. Variation should not exceed 1mm | MEDIUM |
| **Falls in wet areas** | Shower floors: 1:60 to 1:80 fall (12.5-16.7mm per metre) to waste. External balconies: 1:80 to 1:100 | HIGH |
| **Void detection** | Tapping tiles to detect voids (hollow sound) indicates poor adhesive coverage. Any hollow-sounding tile is a defect | MEDIUM |

## 2. AS 3740 — Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas

**Current version:** AS 3740:2021 (replaces AS 3740:2010)
**Referenced by:** NCC 2022 Volume Two, Part 10.2 (Housing Provisions)
**Confidence:** HIGH

AS 3740:2021 sets out the minimum requirements for materials, design, and installation of waterproofing in domestic wet areas. This standard is critical for tiling because **all wet area tiling is laid OVER a waterproofing membrane**, and the tiler must verify waterproofing compliance before tiling.

### 2.1 Wet Area Risk Categories

AS 3740 categorises wet areas by risk level, which determines the extent of waterproofing required:

| Category | Risk Level | Areas Included | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Category 1** | High Risk | Enclosed shower recesses, unenclosed shower areas, baths with hand-held shower fittings, areas within reach of shower spray | HIGH |
| **Category 2** | Moderate Risk | Bathroom areas outside the shower zone (e.g., vanity area, toilet area within bathroom) | HIGH |
| **Category 3** | Low Risk | Laundry, toilet rooms (without shower), kitchen (at sink area) | HIGH |

### 2.2 Waterproofing Height Requirements

These are minimum heights. Waterproofing MUST be complete before tiling commences.

| Location | Minimum Waterproofing Height | Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shower walls (enclosed)** | 1800mm above finished floor level (FFL) OR 50mm above shower rose — whichever is higher | Entire shower wall area to this height | HIGH |
| **Shower walls (unenclosed / no screen)** | 1800mm from FFL, extending 500mm beyond shower spray area | Larger zone than enclosed showers | HIGH |
| **Shower floor** | Entire floor of shower recess | Full membrane coverage, falls to waste | HIGH |
| **Bathroom floor (general)** | Entire floor where on timber/upper storey construction | Minimum 100mm turn-up at walls | HIGH |
| **Bathroom floor (ground floor on slab)** | Shower area mandatory. Remainder of floor varies by state interpretation | Some certifiers require full floor, others only shower zone | MEDIUM |
| **Bathroom wall (outside shower)** | 150mm above FFL (minimum) | Around perimeter of wet area | HIGH |
| **Bath hob/surround** | To top of hob + 150mm on surrounding walls | Where bath has a shower fitting, treat as Category 1 | HIGH |
| **Laundry floor** | Where required, membrane to walls at 150mm minimum | Requirements vary — timber floors always require full membrane | MEDIUM |

### 2.3 Floor Fall Requirements

| Requirement | Specification | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimum fall** | 1:80 (12.5mm per metre) to floor waste | HIGH |
| **Maximum fall** | 1:50 (20mm per metre) to floor waste | HIGH |
| **Continuous fall** | Fall must be continuous from all points to the waste — no ponding allowed | HIGH |
| **Practical test** | A ping-pong ball should roll towards the drain from any point | MEDIUM |

### 2.4 Junction and Penetration Requirements

| Detail | Requirement | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Wall-floor junctions** | Must be sealed. Bond breaker (100% pure silicone bead) applied before Class III membrane. Tape/reinforcing fabric embedded across junction | HIGH |
| **Wall-wall junctions (corners)** | Must be sealed with bond breaker and membrane carried around corners | HIGH |
| **Pipe penetrations** | Puddle flanges MUST be installed into the concrete slab for all waste pipes. Sealed with manufacturer-specified collars or grommets | HIGH |
| **Floor waste** | Puddle flange clamped to membrane. Must be accessible for maintenance. Three-part puddle flange system preferred | HIGH |
| **Shower screen fixings** | Any fixings through the membrane must be sealed. Frameless shower screens with base channels require membrane under and up the channel | MEDIUM |

### 2.5 Additional Requirements (AS 3740:2021 Updates)

| New/Updated Clause | Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Clause 4.8.5 — Shower near door** | Where shower extremity is within 200mm of a wet area exit, must have: (a) enclosed shower, AND (b) waterstop 5mm above FFL under screen, OR a hob, OR 15mm step-down, AND (c) vertical waterstop where screen meets wall | HIGH |
| **Clause 4.9.2 — Door frame protection** | Timber door frames must NOT be embedded in tiles. Minimum 2mm sealed gap between architrave and floor. Underside of jamb/architrave must be moisture-treated | HIGH |
| **Membrane types** | Class III (liquid-applied) most common in residential. Sheet membranes acceptable. Membrane must be compatible with adhesive and tile system | HIGH |

**Scope impact:** The tiling scope must include a line item for "verify waterproofing certification" or "inspect waterproofing membrane" BEFORE tiling commences. The tiler does NOT install the waterproofing (in most cases — see Section 3 for licensing), but must verify it has been done, is certified, and the membrane is undamaged. If membrane is damaged during tiling, it must be repaired by the waterproofer before tiles are laid over it.

---

## 3. Tiling Licensing Requirements by State

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from state government licensing body websites)

All states and territories require the **CPC31320 — Certificate III in Wall and Floor Tiling** (or recognised equivalent) as the base qualification. Licensing thresholds and bodies vary.

### 3.1 Tiling Licence Summary Table

| State/Territory | Licensing Body | Licence Required? | Dollar Threshold | Licence Duration | Key Notes | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | NSW Fair Trading | YES | > $5,000 (incl GST) | 1, 3, or 5 years | Contractor licence for $5k+. Supervisor certificate also available. Must hold CPC31320 + 2 years experience | HIGH |
| **VIC** | Victorian Building Authority (VBA) | CONDITIONAL | No specific threshold for single-trade tiling | Ongoing (renew) | Single-task tiling work (e.g., just tiling, not broader building work) is EXEMPT from practitioner registration regardless of value. However, VBA offers "Domestic Builder (Limited to Floor and Wall Tiling)" registration for those doing broader work. This is unusual compared to other states | HIGH |
| **QLD** | QBCC (Qld Building & Construction Commission) | YES | > $3,300 (incl GST) | Annual renewal | Most restrictive threshold. Contractor licence needed. Must hold CPC31320 + experience | HIGH |
| **SA** | Consumer & Business Services (CBS) | YES | All residential building work | Registration card | CBS issues registration cards (equivalent to licences). Tiler must hold a Wall & Floor Tiling registration. May also hold "Waterproofing Limited to Bathrooms, Laundries & Balconies" | HIGH |
| **WA** | Building Services Board (Dept of Mines, Industry Regulation & Safety) | CONDITIONAL | > $20,000 (incl GST) | 3-year renewal | Tilers employed by a registered builder do NOT need their own licence. Independent contractors doing work over $20k need Building Contractor registration | HIGH |
| **TAS** | Consumer, Building & Occupational Services (CBOS) | YES | > $5,000 (incl GST) | Renewable | Restricted builder's licence for tiling. Must be accredited by Dept of Justice for specific tiling activities | HIGH |
| **ACT** | ACT Planning & Land Authority (ACTPLA) | YES | > $5,000 (incl GST) | Renewable | Must be licensed and accredited before any residential tiling work over threshold | HIGH |
| **NT** | Self-regulated (Contractor Accreditation Ltd — CAL) | NO (voluntary) | No legal requirement | N/A | No mandatory tiling licence in NT. Voluntary accreditation through CAL (Tiling — Wall and Floor). For building work over $12,000 requiring a building permit, a licensed builder must be involved | MEDIUM |

### 3.2 Waterproofing Licence — Separate from Tiling?

This is a critical distinction for scope generation. In most states, waterproofing is a SEPARATE licensed trade from tiling.

| State | Can a Tiler Do Waterproofing? | Separate Licence Required? | Key Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Only with separate waterproofing licence | YES — separate waterproofing contractor licence required for work > $5,000 | Only licensed waterproofers can issue compliance certificates. A tiler CANNOT waterproof unless they also hold a waterproofing licence | HIGH |
| **VIC** | YES (no mandatory licence for waterproofing) | NO mandatory licence | Victoria does not require a specific waterproofing licence. However, mandatory inspection by a building inspector/surveyor is required BEFORE covering the membrane. Plumbers can also waterproof as part of their scope | HIGH |
| **QLD** | YES (tilers can waterproof for their own tiling work) | Separate WP licence available but tilers can waterproof bathroom/balcony tiling under their tiling licence | QBCC allows tilers to apply waterproofing where it is incidental to their tiling work. Separate waterproofing licence exists for standalone WP work | HIGH |
| **SA** | YES (with additional registration) | Separate "Waterproofing Limited" registration | SA tilers often hold both Wall & Floor Tiling AND Waterproofing Limited to Bathrooms, Laundries & Balconies registrations | HIGH |
| **WA** | Varies | No specific waterproofing licence category | Waterproofing typically performed by the tiler or plumber. Building surveyor inspection required | MEDIUM |
| **TAS** | Varies | No specific waterproofing licence category | Licensed builders or tilers may perform waterproofing. Compliance certificate required | MEDIUM |
| **ACT** | Varies | Separate waterproofing class exists | Tilers may need additional endorsement for waterproofing work | MEDIUM |
| **NT** | YES (no licensing requirement) | NO | No mandatory licensing for either trade. Voluntary accreditation available | MEDIUM |

**Scope impact:** The AI scope generator should ALWAYS treat waterproofing and tiling as SEPARATE trades in the scope unless the user is in QLD, VIC, or SA where the tiler may also waterproof. The default assumption should be: waterproofing is done by a separate waterproofer BEFORE the tiler arrives. The scope must include "Verify waterproofing certificate before commencing tiling" as a prerequisite.

## 4. Waterproofing Certification

**Confidence:** HIGH (sourced from state government and regulatory body websites)

### 4.1 What is a Waterproofing Certificate?

A waterproofing compliance certificate is a formal document confirming that the waterproofing installation in a wet area complies with AS 3740 and any applicable state building regulations. It is critical evidence that the membrane was correctly installed before being concealed by tiles.

### 4.2 Who Issues It?

| Issuer | When | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Licensed waterproofer** | After completing waterproofing work and before tiles are laid. The installing waterproofer issues the certificate in most states | HIGH |
| **Building inspector / surveyor** | As part of a mandatory inspection stage. In VIC, this is a legislated requirement under the Building Regulations 2017 | HIGH |
| **Plumber** (in some states) | Where the plumber performs waterproofing (VIC, QLD), they may issue the certificate. In VIC, plumbers must lodge certificates with the VBA within 5 business days | MEDIUM |

### 4.3 When is it Issued?

The certificate is issued AFTER the waterproofing membrane is applied and cured, but BEFORE any tiling, screeding, or other covering work begins. The membrane must be visible and inspectable at the time of certification.

**Timeline in the construction sequence:**

```
1. Substrate preparation (by builder/tiler)
2. Plumbing rough-in (pipes, waste, floor waste)
3. Waterproofing membrane applied (by licensed waterproofer)
4. Membrane cures (24-48 hours typical, per manufacturer)
5. --> WATERPROOFING INSPECTION & CERTIFICATE ISSUED <--
6. Tile screed / falls created (if not done before WP)
7. Tiling commences
```

### 4.4 What Does the Tiler Need to Verify?

Before commencing any wet area tiling, the tiler MUST verify:

| Check | Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Certificate exists** | A signed waterproofing compliance certificate must be on site or available from the builder/homeowner | HIGH |
| **Certificate matches the job** | Certificate must reference the correct property address, specific wet areas waterproofed, and date | HIGH |
| **Licensed installer** | Certificate must show the waterproofer's licence/registration number (in states requiring licensing) | HIGH |
| **Membrane is undamaged** | Visual inspection of the membrane for tears, punctures, lifting at edges, or incomplete coverage | HIGH |
| **Membrane is compatible** | The tile adhesive must be compatible with the waterproofing membrane. Check both manufacturers' technical data sheets | MEDIUM |
| **Falls are correct** | Before tiling, verify the screed falls comply with 1:80 to 1:50 (check with level) | HIGH |
| **Penetrations are sealed** | Puddle flanges installed, pipe penetrations sealed, floor waste flanges clamped | HIGH |

### 4.5 What Happens if the Tiler Tiles Over Uncertified Waterproofing?

| Consequence | Detail | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Liability transfer** | The tiler may assume liability for waterproofing failures if they proceed without verifying certification | HIGH |
| **Insurance issues** | Home warranty insurance and builder's insurance may void claims for water damage if no WP certificate exists | HIGH |
| **Rectification cost** | If waterproofing fails, ALL tiling must be removed to access and repair the membrane. This can cost $5,000-$25,000+ depending on the area | HIGH |
| **Non-compliance** | The building work is non-compliant with the NCC and AS 3740. Building certifiers can refuse to issue occupancy certificates or final inspection approvals | HIGH |
| **State enforcement** | In NSW and QLD, performing tiling over uncertified waterproofing can result in fines and licence sanctions for the tiler | MEDIUM |

**Scope impact:** The scope MUST include a line item: "Confirm waterproofing compliance certificate prior to commencing wet area tiling." The scope should note: "Tiling of wet areas will not commence until a valid waterproofing certificate is provided. Any delay in waterproofing certification may delay the tiling schedule." This protects both the homeowner and the tiler.

---

## 5. Slip Resistance Requirements (AS 4586)

**Current version:** AS 4586:2013 — Slip Resistance Classification of New Pedestrian Surfaces
**Companion handbook:** HB 198:2014 — Guide to the Specification and Testing of Slip Resistance of Pedestrian Surfaces
**Companion standard:** AS 4663:2013 — Slip Resistance Measurement of Existing Pedestrian Surfaces (on-site testing)
**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.1 P-Rating Classification (Wet Pendulum Test)

The Wet Pendulum Test is the **primary slip resistance test used in Australia** and is the basis for NCC compliance. It measures the Slip Resistance Value (SRV) using a British Pendulum device. Two rubber sliders are used: Slider 96 (shod/shoe traffic) and Slider 55 (barefoot traffic).

| P Rating | SRV Range (Slider 96 — Shod) | SRV Range (Slider 55 — Barefoot) | Slip Risk Level | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | < 12 | — | Extremely High | HIGH |
| **P1** | 12-24 | < 20 | Very High | HIGH |
| **P2** | 25-34 | 20-34 | High | HIGH |
| **P3** | 35-44 | 35-39 | Moderate | HIGH |
| **P4** | 45-54 | 40-44 | Low | HIGH |
| **P5** | > 54 | > 44 | Very Low | HIGH |

### 5.2 R-Rating Classification (Oil-Wet Ramp Test)

The Oil-Wet Ramp Test is primarily used for commercial and industrial applications. A person wearing standardised footwear walks on an oil-covered panel at increasing angles.

| R Rating | Ramp Angle Range | Slip Resistance Level | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R9** | 6 to < 10 degrees | Minimal | HIGH |
| **R10** | 10 to < 19 degrees | Moderate | HIGH |
| **R11** | 19 to < 27 degrees | Good | HIGH |
| **R12** | 27 to < 35 degrees | Very Good | HIGH |
| **R13** | 35+ degrees | Extreme | HIGH |

### 5.3 Barefoot Ramp Rating (A, B, C)

Used specifically for areas where people walk barefoot on wet surfaces (pools, communal showers, change rooms).

| Rating | Mean Angle Threshold | Typical Application | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | 12 to < 18 degrees | Dry change rooms, low-risk barefoot areas | HIGH |
| **B** | 18 to < 24 degrees | Pool surrounds, shower rooms, communal change areas | HIGH |
| **C** | 24+ degrees | Sloped pool entries, water slides, extreme wet barefoot areas | HIGH |

### 5.4 Recommended Slip Ratings by Location

The NCC **only mandates** slip-rated flooring for stairs, landings, and ramps in residential buildings (Class 1). However, HB 198:2014 provides strong recommendations for other areas. Industry best practice follows these guidelines:

| Location | Recommended P Rating (minimum) | Recommended R Rating (minimum) | Barefoot Rating | Mandatory or Recommended? | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Internal stairs, ramps, landings** | P3 (Slider 96) | R10 | — | MANDATORY (NCC) | HIGH |
| **Bathroom floor (general)** | P3 | R10 | — | Recommended (HB 198) | HIGH |
| **Shower floor** | P4 | R11 | B | Recommended (HB 198) — strongly advised | HIGH |
| **Kitchen floor** | P3 | R10 | — | Recommended (HB 198) | MEDIUM |
| **Laundry floor** | P3 | R10 | — | Recommended (HB 198) | MEDIUM |
| **Living room, bedroom (dry)** | P0-P2 | R9 | — | No requirement | HIGH |
| **Outdoor patio / alfresco (covered)** | P3-P4 | R10-R11 | — | Recommended (HB 198) | MEDIUM |
| **Outdoor walkway (exposed)** | P4 | R11 | — | Recommended (HB 198) | HIGH |
| **Pool surround** | P4-P5 | R11 | B | Recommended (HB 198) — strongly advised | HIGH |
| **Pool entry (sloped)** | P5 | R12-R13 | C | Recommended (HB 198) | MEDIUM |
| **Front porch / entry** | P4 | R10-R11 | — | Recommended (HB 198) | MEDIUM |
| **Garage floor** | P3 | R10-R11 | — | Recommended | LOW |

### 5.5 How Slip Ratings Affect the Scope

**Scope impact:** The scope should specify the **minimum slip rating** for each tiled area. For residential renovations, the key requirements are:

1. **Shower floors:** Must specify minimum P4 or R11 tiles. This directly affects tile selection and therefore cost.
2. **Bathroom floors:** Minimum P3 or R10 tiles recommended.
3. **Outdoor areas:** Minimum P4 or R11. Higher-slip-resistance tiles are typically more expensive and have a more textured finish.
4. **Internal dry areas:** No minimum required, but the scope should note that polished/glazed tiles (P0-P1) should NOT be used in any area that may get wet.

The scope should include a note: "All tiles selected for wet areas must meet a minimum P3 slip resistance rating per AS 4586. Shower floor tiles must meet minimum P4. Tile selection is the responsibility of the homeowner; the tiler must advise if selected tiles do not meet the required slip resistance for the intended area."

---

## 6. Movement Joints (Expansion Joints)

**Standard reference:** AS 3958:2023, Section 5, Clause 5.4.7
**Confidence:** HIGH

Movement joints are one of the most commonly omitted items in tiling scopes, yet their absence causes cracking, tenting (tiles lifting), and grout failure. AS 3958 is explicit about when and where they are required.

### 6.1 Types of Movement Joints

| Joint Type | Purpose | Filled With | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Structural movement joints** | Carry through from the building structure. Where the substrate has a structural joint (e.g., building expansion joint), the tile installation must have a corresponding joint in exactly the same location | Flexible sealant or purpose-built movement joint profile. NEVER grout | HIGH |
| **Intermediate movement joints** | Stress-relieving joints to accommodate thermal expansion, moisture movement, and substrate deflection in large tiled areas | Flexible sealant (silicone or polyurethane) or movement joint trim. NEVER grout | HIGH |
| **Perimeter joints** | Gap between the tile edge and any restraining surface (walls, columns, door frames, planter boxes, built-in fixtures) | Flexible sealant (typically matching silicone). NEVER grout | HIGH |
| **Contraction joints** | Reduce strain in large poured substrates. Must be carried through the tile installation | Flexible sealant. NEVER grout | HIGH |

### 6.2 Spacing Requirements

| Location | Maximum Spacing | Maximum Tiled Area Between Joints | Key Rule | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Internal floors** | 4.5m in any dimension where any floor dimension exceeds 9m | Not explicitly stated for internal, but 25m2 is a common industry guideline | Joints required where any single dimension exceeds 9m, spaced at max 4.5m | HIGH |
| **Internal floors (exposed to direct sunlight)** | 4.5m in any dimension where any floor dimension exceeds 6m | Sunlight through windows creates thermal movement | Reduced trigger threshold due to solar gain | HIGH |
| **External floors / balconies / patios** | 4.5m in any dimension | 25m2 maximum area between joints | More frequent joints due to greater thermal and moisture movement | HIGH |
| **Internal walls** | 3 to 4.5m horizontally, at storey heights vertically | — | Horizontal joints at 3-4.5m centres, vertical joints at floor-to-ceiling intervals | HIGH |
| **Internal walls (showers)** | At vertical corners of shower compartments | — | Every vertical internal corner in a shower is a movement joint (filled with silicone, not grout) | HIGH |

### 6.3 Where Movement Joints are Always Required

| Location | Requirement | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **At all structural joints** | The tile joint must be directly over and aligned with the structural joint below. Must extend through tile AND bedding material | HIGH |
| **At all perimeters** | Where tiles meet walls, columns, door frames, fixtures, or any restraining surface. Minimum 3mm gap from restraining surface (can omit formal perimeter joint if area < 10m2 and 3mm gap is maintained) | HIGH |
| **Change of substrate** | Where the tiled floor crosses from one substrate type to another (e.g., concrete to timber) | HIGH |
| **Change of plane** | Where floors meet walls. Where walls change direction (internal corners). Where floors change level | HIGH |
| **At thresholds/doorways** | Where tiling passes through a doorway between rooms, a movement joint should be placed at the threshold | MEDIUM |
| **Around penetrations** | Pipes, columns, and other penetrations through the tiled surface | MEDIUM |

### 6.4 Movement Joint Dimensions

| Specification | Requirement | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimum width** | 6mm (for both floor and wall movement joints) | HIGH |
| **Depth** | Must extend through the tile AND the adhesive/bedding. For substantial anticipated movement, carry through to the structural substrate face | HIGH |
| **Sealant type** | Silicone or polyurethane sealant. Must be compatible with the tile material and adhesive. Neutral-cure silicone preferred (acetic-cure silicone can corrode metals and damage some natural stones) | HIGH |
| **Joint profiles** | Purpose-built metal or PVC movement joint profiles (T-strips, L-strips) are an alternative to sealant-filled joints. Suitable for high-traffic areas | MEDIUM |

### 6.5 Common Residential Application

For typical residential renovations (single rooms under 25m2), the practical movement joint requirements are:

| Renovation Type | Typical Movement Joint Requirements | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Bathroom (standard, < 10m2)** | Silicone at all internal corners (wall-wall AND wall-floor). Silicone around shower screen base. Silicone at perimeter where tile meets vanity, toilet, and door frame. No intermediate floor joints needed if < 10m2 | HIGH |
| **Kitchen (splashback)** | Silicone where splashback meets benchtop. Silicone at ends of splashback (wall returns). Silicone where splashback meets underside of overhead cabinets | HIGH |
| **Kitchen (floor, < 25m2)** | Perimeter joints at all walls. Threshold joint at doorways. No intermediate joints needed if room dimension < 9m | HIGH |
| **Living area (floor, > 25m2)** | Perimeter joints at all walls. Intermediate joints at 4.5m centres if any dimension exceeds 9m. Threshold joints at doorways | HIGH |
| **Outdoor / alfresco** | Perimeter joints at all walls and edges. Intermediate joints at 4.5m centres. Joints at changes of direction. All joints minimum 6mm wide | HIGH |

**Scope impact:** Movement joints must be explicitly listed in the scope. The scope should specify:
- Silicone colour (to match grout or contrasting)
- Locations (all internal corners, perimeters, thresholds)
- Whether purpose-built movement joint profiles are used (adds cost)
- That all shower internal corners are silicone, NOT grout
- For large areas, the number and location of intermediate movement joints

Failure to scope movement joints leads to disputes. Homeowners often expect all joints to be grouted and see silicone joints as a "lesser" finish. The scope should note: "Movement joints (silicone-filled) are required at all internal corners, perimeters, and thresholds per AS 3958. These are NOT a defect — they are a mandatory requirement to prevent cracking."

## 7. Scope-of-Works Implications Summary

This section summarises how the standards above should influence the AI-generated scope-of-works.

### 7.1 Mandatory Scope Inclusions (Standards-Driven)

Every tiling scope-of-works for wet areas MUST include:

| Item | Standard Reference | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Verify waterproofing certificate before tiling | AS 3740 / NCC | Tiler assumes liability if they tile over uncertified WP |
| Substrate inspection and preparation | AS 3958 Sec 4 | Substrate must meet flatness and condition tolerances |
| Specify adhesive type (C1/C2) and method | AS 3958 Sec 5.6 | Wrong adhesive causes tile failure |
| Specify minimum adhesive coverage % | AS 3958 | 90% for wet areas, 80% for dry floors |
| Specify grout type (CG1/CG2/epoxy) | AS 3958 | Wet areas should use CG2 minimum |
| Movement joints at all internal corners | AS 3958 Clause 5.4.7 | Silicone, not grout, at all direction changes |
| Movement joints at perimeters | AS 3958 Clause 5.4.7 | Where tile meets any restraining surface |
| Specify slip resistance requirement per area | AS 4586 / HB 198 | Minimum P3 bathrooms, P4 showers, P4 outdoor |
| Falls to waste in shower floors | AS 3740, AS 3958 | 1:60 to 1:80 fall |

### 7.2 State-Specific Scope Notes

The scope should include a note appropriate to the homeowner's state:

| State | Note for Scope |
|---|---|
| **NSW** | "Waterproofing must be completed by a separately licensed waterproofer. A waterproofing compliance certificate must be provided before tiling commences." |
| **VIC** | "Waterproofing must be inspected by a building inspector/surveyor before tiling commences (mandatory inspection stage under VIC Building Regulations 2017)." |
| **QLD** | "Waterproofing must be completed by a QBCC-licensed tradesperson. Form 43/16 compliance documentation must be provided before tiling commences." |
| **SA** | "Waterproofing must be completed by a registered tradesperson. Compliance certificate required before tiling." |
| **WA, TAS, ACT, NT** | "Waterproofing must be completed and a compliance certificate provided before tiling commences." |

### 7.3 Exclusions the Scope Should Note

| Exclusion | Reason |
|---|---|
| Waterproofing installation | Separate trade in most states. Tiler verifies, does not install (unless also licensed) |
| Plumbing rough-in / floor waste installation | Must be done before waterproofing AND tiling |
| Structural substrate repairs (cracked slab, rotten timber) | Builder or structural trade responsibility |
| Tile supply and selection | Unless scope explicitly includes supply. Tiler should advise on suitability |
| Asbestos testing / removal | If renovation involves pre-1990 homes, asbestos assessment may be needed before removing existing tiles |
