# SECTION 8: HOMEOWNER MISTAKES & RED FLAGS

## 8.1 Common Homeowner Mistakes

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent themes across Australian tile retailers, tiling forums, and trade publications)

Tiling is one of the most visible trades in a renovation -- it's the finish that homeowners look at every day. Mistakes in tile selection, specification, or coordination with other trades are extremely common and often expensive to fix because rectification usually means demolishing and re-tiling. The following are the most frequent mistakes Australian homeowners make.

---

### 8.1.1 Choosing Tiles Without Checking Slip Ratings

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners choose tiles based purely on appearance (colour, pattern, texture) without checking the slip resistance rating. They buy beautiful polished porcelain or gloss tiles and plan to use them on bathroom floors, shower bases, laundry floors, or outdoor areas -- only to discover the tiles are unsafe or non-compliant for those applications.

**Why It Matters:**

Australian Standard AS 4586 governs slip resistance classification of new pedestrian surface materials. The National Construction Code (NCC) references this standard for wet areas and external surfaces. While residential homes have fewer mandatory requirements than commercial buildings, there are practical and legal implications:

- **Safety:** Wet polished tiles are extremely dangerous. Bathrooms, showers, laundries, and outdoor areas are high-risk slip zones.
- **Insurance:** If someone is injured on a surface you chose that is clearly inappropriate for a wet area, your home insurance may not cover the claim.
- **Resale:** A building inspector may flag non-compliant or obviously unsafe tiling during a pre-purchase inspection.
- **Cannot be fixed easily:** Once tiles are laid, the only fix is to rip them out and start again.

**Australian Slip Rating System (AS 4586):**

| Rating | Test Method | Slip Resistance | Typical Use |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **P0** | Wet Pendulum | Very Low | Dry indoor areas only |
| **P1** | Wet Pendulum | Low | Dry indoor areas only |
| **P2** | Wet Pendulum | Moderate | Indoor areas with occasional moisture |
| **P3** | Wet Pendulum | Good | Bathrooms, ensuites, laundries, covered outdoor areas. **This is the minimum recommended for any wet residential area.** |
| **P4** | Wet Pendulum | High | Pool surrounds, outdoor entertaining, driveways |
| **P5** | Wet Pendulum | Very High | Commercial kitchens, ramps, heavy-wet areas |
| **R9-R13** | Oil-Wet Ramp | Various | Alternative rating scale; R10+ generally suitable for residential wet areas |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner buys 20m2 of polished porcelain tiles (P0 or P1 rated) for their bathroom floor
2. Tiler refuses to lay them on the shower base or warns they're slippery
3. Homeowner must either return tiles (restocking fees apply, usually 15-25%), buy new compliant tiles, or accept the safety risk
4. If already laid, the entire floor must be demolished and re-tiled -- $2,000-$5,000+ wasted

**How to Avoid It:**
- Check the slip rating BEFORE purchasing. Every tile product should have a P-rating or R-rating listed in its specifications
- For bathroom floors: minimum P3 recommended
- For shower bases: minimum P3 recommended (P4 preferred)
- For outdoor areas: minimum P4 recommended
- For pool surrounds: minimum P4 (some councils require P5)
- Ask the tile retailer: "What is the wet pendulum slip rating for this tile?"
- If in doubt, matte or textured finishes are generally safer than polished/gloss

**Key warning for AI:** If the homeowner selects tiles for a bathroom, laundry, or outdoor area, the scope should include a note: "Confirm all floor tiles meet minimum P3 slip resistance rating (AS 4586) for wet areas. Polished or gloss tiles are not recommended for wet floor applications."

---

### 8.1.2 Not Understanding Tile Wastage Allowance

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners calculate the exact square metres of floor/wall area and buy precisely that amount of tile. They arrive at the job site with 12.5m2 of tile for a 12.5m2 area, with zero margin for cuts, breakage, pattern matching, or future repairs.

**Why It Matters:**

Tiles must be cut to fit around edges, corners, plumbing penetrations, door frames, niches, and irregular walls. Each cut produces an offcut that is usually too small to use. Some tiles will break during cutting (especially natural stone and large format porcelain). The tile pattern may require specific alignment that wastes partial tiles. And critically, you need spare tiles for future repairs -- if a tile cracks in 5 years, you need matching replacement tiles from the same batch.

**Wastage Allowance Guidelines:**

| Layout Pattern | Minimum Extra % | Recommended Extra % | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Straight lay (grid)** | 10% | 10-15% | Simplest pattern, least waste |
| **Brick bond (half offset)** | 10% | 12-15% | Slightly more cuts at edges |
| **1/3 offset** | 10% | 12-15% | Similar to brick bond |
| **Diagonal (45-degree)** | 15% | 15-20% | Many angled cuts at all edges |
| **Herringbone** | 15% | 15-20% | High number of cuts, pattern matching required |
| **Chevron** | 15% | 20% | Pre-cut angles, complex pattern alignment |
| **Basketweave** | 10% | 12-15% | Depends on tile size combination |
| **Feature walls (niches, mixed sizes)** | 15% | 15-20% | Cuts around niches, recesses, and mixed elements |

**Additional factors that increase wastage:**
- Rooms with many jogs, corners, and alcoves: add another 5%
- Very large format tiles (600x1200+) in small rooms: add 5-10% (offcuts are larger but less usable)
- Natural stone with natural variation: add 5% (reject rate for veining/colour)
- Mosaic sheets with pattern matching: add 10-15%
- First-time tiler (DIY): add 10-15% for breakage during cutting

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner runs out of tiles mid-job. Tiler has to stop work.
2. Remaining tiles may not be available, or may come from a different batch (colour variation -- see 8.2.1).
3. Lead time for reorder delays the entire renovation (other trades waiting on tiling to finish).
4. No spare tiles kept for future repairs. In 3 years, a tile cracks and the exact tile is discontinued.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Always add minimum 10% to the calculated area for straight lay
- Add 15-20% for complex patterns (herringbone, diagonal, chevron)
- Buy all tiles at once from the same batch
- Keep at least 4-6 spare tiles stored safely for future repairs
- Ask the tiler for their recommended quantity -- experienced tilers know how much waste a room will generate

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should include a line item: "Tile wastage allowance: [X]% above measured area." The percentage should be based on the selected laying pattern. Additionally: "Homeowner to retain minimum [4-6] spare tiles from each tile type for future repairs."

### 8.1.3 Assuming Grout Colour Doesn't Matter

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners spend weeks choosing the perfect tile but give grout colour zero thought, assuming it will be "white" or "grey" and look fine. They don't realise that grout colour dramatically changes the final aesthetic -- the same tile can look completely different depending on whether the grout matches, contrasts, or clashes.

**Why It Matters:**

Grout lines are visible everywhere. In a typical bathroom, grout might cover 5-15% of the visible surface area. The grout colour creates the visual "grid" that defines each tile. A poor grout choice can make expensive tiles look cheap, and a good grout choice can elevate budget tiles.

**The Impact of Grout Colour:**

| Grout Choice | Visual Effect | Best For | Watch Out For |
|-------------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Matching grout** (same colour as tile) | Seamless, continuous surface; tiles blend together | Large-format tiles, minimalist design, making spaces feel larger | Can look flat/boring with small tiles; harder to see where tiles meet |
| **Contrasting grout** (dark grout + light tile, or vice versa) | Highlights each individual tile; creates a graphic, geometric pattern | Subway tiles, hexagonal tiles, statement walls, heritage looks | Emphasises every imperfect cut, uneven spacing, and lippage. Requires excellent workmanship. |
| **Complementary grout** (1-2 shades off the tile) | Subtle definition; tiles are distinct but not jarring | Most situations -- the safest choice. Works well for floors and walls. | Can still show dirt if too light on a floor |
| **Light grout on floors** | Bright, clean look | Wall tiles, light-traffic areas | Stains easily on floors; requires regular cleaning. White grout on kitchen floors is a maintenance nightmare. |
| **Dark grout on floors** | Hides dirt and staining; practical | High-traffic floors, kitchens, laundries, entries | Can look heavy in small spaces; may fade over time |

**Undertone Matching:**
Professional designers know that undertone matching is almost more important than colour matching. Tiles have undertones (warm or cool) and grout has undertones:
- Warm tiles (beige, cream, terracotta) need warm-toned grout
- Cool tiles (grey, white with blue undertone) need cool-toned grout
- Mixing warm tiles with cool grout (or vice versa) creates visual discord

**Grout Type Also Matters:**

| Grout Type | Cost Range (per m2 installed) | Maintenance | Best For |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Cement-based (sanded)** | Cheapest (included in standard tiling labour) | Porous; stains over time; needs sealing | Budget jobs, walls, dry areas |
| **Cement-based (unsanded)** | Similar to sanded | Same issues; slightly smoother finish | Narrow joints (under 3mm), wall tiles |
| **Epoxy grout** | $15-$30/m2 premium over cement | Non-porous; stain-resistant; never needs sealing; waterproof | Wet areas, shower floors, kitchen splashbacks, anywhere you want low maintenance |
| **Urethane grout** | $10-$20/m2 premium | Good stain resistance; flexible | Feature walls, areas with minor movement |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner chooses white grout for a dark-tiled kitchen floor. Within months it looks filthy.
2. Tiler uses "standard white" grout with warm-toned tiles -- the cool white clashes with the warm tile.
3. Homeowner sees the result after grouting and hates it. Regrouting a bathroom costs $500-$1,500+ (or much more to fully remove and redo).
4. Homeowner picks contrasting grout for large walls, then discovers every slight imperfection in tile spacing and cutting is highlighted.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Select grout colour at the SAME TIME as tile selection. Bring tile samples to the grout colour chart.
- Test grout colour on a spare tile before committing. Wet grout is darker than dry grout -- wait for it to fully cure.
- For floors: lean towards darker/complementary grout. White grout on floors = high maintenance.
- For showers/wet areas: strongly consider epoxy grout for longevity and ease of cleaning.
- Discuss grout colour with the tiler BEFORE they start work. Don't leave it to "whatever they have on the truck."

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should include a mandatory line item: "Grout colour: [SPECIFY COLOUR NAME AND BRAND]. Grout type: [cement-based / epoxy]. Grout to be confirmed by homeowner before tiling commences." If no grout colour is specified, the AI should flag this as incomplete.

---

### 8.1.4 Not Selecting Tiles Early Enough

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners leave tile selection until the renovation is underway, assuming they can "pick them later." They don't realise that tile selection is on the critical path of the renovation timeline -- it directly gates when tiling can start, which gates when everything AFTER tiling can happen (grouting, sealing, fixture installation, painting, cleaning, handover).

**Why It Matters:**

Tiles have variable lead times depending on type, source, and availability:

| Tile Type | Typical Lead Time | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **Standard ceramic/porcelain (in-stock at retailer)** | 2-5 business days | Fastest option. Major retailers (Beaumont, National, Amber) carry large stock ranges |
| **Standard but specific colour/size (order-in)** | 1-3 weeks | Available from the manufacturer but not at the local store |
| **Imported European tiles** | 4-8 weeks | Shipped from Spain, Italy, or Portugal. Subject to shipping delays |
| **Handmade/artisan tiles** | 6-12 weeks | Made-to-order production. Amethyst Art Factory (Adelaide) quotes 3-6 months for custom |
| **Natural stone (specific slab/batch)** | 2-6 weeks | Depends on quarry availability and importing |
| **Discontinued or end-of-line tiles** | No restock possible | Once gone, they're gone. Critical to buy enough (see wastage section) |
| **Custom-coloured or bespoke tiles** | 8-16+ weeks | Truly custom production. Budget for long lead times |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Tiler is booked for Week 4 of the renovation. Homeowner hasn't chosen tiles yet in Week 3.
2. Homeowner chooses an imported tile with a 6-week lead time. The tiler's booking passes. Getting them rebooked adds another 2-4 weeks.
3. Every trade after tiling (painting, fixture installation, shower screen, vanity) is also delayed.
4. A 6-week renovation becomes a 12-week renovation, with the homeowner paying rent elsewhere or living in construction chaos.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Select ALL tiles before the renovation starts (ideally during the quoting/planning phase)
- Order tiles as soon as they're selected. Don't wait for the renovation to begin.
- Confirm delivery date with the tile supplier and communicate this to the builder/tiler
- For imported or custom tiles: select these 8-12 weeks before the tiler is needed on site
- Have tiles delivered and stored on site before the tiler's start date

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should include a note: "All tiles to be selected and ordered before renovation commencement. Imported, handmade, or custom tiles may require 4-12+ weeks lead time. Late tile selection will delay the tiling schedule and all subsequent trades."

---

### 8.1.5 Choosing Very Large Format Tiles for Small Spaces

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners see stunning large-format tiles (600x1200mm, 800x800mm, or even 1200x1200mm) in showrooms or on social media, displayed in large open-plan spaces, and decide to use them in their 1.5m x 2.5m bathroom. They don't understand the practical and financial implications of large tiles in small, complex rooms.

**Why It Matters:**

Large format tiles require more cuts in small rooms, more skilled labour, and generate more waste. In a bathroom, there are also drainage slope requirements that are harder to achieve with large tiles.

**The Problems:**

| Issue | Explanation | Cost Impact |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Excessive cuts** | A 600x1200 tile in a 1.5m-wide bathroom means almost every tile on one axis needs cutting. Lots of L-shaped cuts around toilets, vanities, and shower recesses. | Higher labour cost (30-50% more time); more breakage |
| **Waste** | Large offcuts that are too big to ignore but too awkward to reuse. A 600x1200 tile cut to 400x1200 leaves a 200x1200 strip -- often unusable. | 15-25% wastage vs 10-15% for smaller tiles |
| **Shower floor slope** | Shower floors must fall to the drain (1:80 minimum). With large tiles, creating the fall requires either: (a) cutting tiles into smaller pieces, (b) using a linear drain so the fall is in one direction only, or (c) using smaller tiles on the shower floor (design transition). | Linear drain: $300-$800 extra. Smaller shower floor tiles: separate selection and supply cost. |
| **Labour cost** | Large format tiling is a two-person job. The tiles are heavy (a 600x1200x10mm porcelain tile weighs approximately 17kg each), require back-buttering plus bed adhesive (100% coverage), and need a perfectly flat substrate. | Labour rate: $80-$150/m2 vs $50-$80/m2 for standard tiles |
| **Substrate flatness** | Large tiles show every imperfection in the substrate. The floor or wall must be extremely flat (3mm tolerance over 2m). Levelling compound may be needed. | Self-levelling compound: $25-$50/m2 if required |
| **Transport and handling** | Heavy, fragile in large sizes. Higher breakage risk during delivery and on-site handling. | Delivery surcharge for large-format pallets; replacement cost for broken tiles |

**When Large Format Tiles Work Well:**
- Open-plan living areas (large uninterrupted floor space)
- Feature walls (single unbroken wall surface)
- Wide hallways and entries
- Bathrooms over 6-8m2 with a linear drain

**When to Avoid Large Format Tiles:**
- Bathrooms under 4m2
- Shower bases (unless using a linear drain)
- Rooms with many angles, jogs, and niches
- Floors that aren't perfectly level (old houses, timber subfloors)

**How to Avoid It:**
- Consider 300x600 or 450x450 tiles for small bathrooms -- they achieve a clean, modern look without the complications
- If set on large format, budget an additional 30-50% on labour and 15-20% on tile wastage
- Always use a linear drain in a shower with large-format floor tiles
- Discuss tile size with the tiler BEFORE purchasing -- they will advise on practicality

**Key warning for AI:** If the homeowner specifies large-format tiles (any dimension over 600mm) for a bathroom under 4m2, the scope should note: "Large format tiles in small spaces incur higher labour costs ($80-$150/m2 vs $50-$80/m2 standard), increased wastage (15-25%), and may require a linear drain for the shower floor. Consider 300x600mm tiles as a practical alternative."

---

### 8.1.6 Not Understanding Cost Difference Between Standard and Complex Patterns

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners see herringbone, chevron, or diagonal patterns on Instagram and Pinterest and assume the labour cost is similar to a standard straight lay or brick bond. They select a complex pattern and are shocked when the tiling quote is 30-80% higher than expected.

**Why It Matters:**

Complex patterns require significantly more labour time (more cuts per m2, more layout planning, tighter tolerances for alignment) and generate more material waste.

**Labour Cost Comparison by Pattern:**

| Laying Pattern | Typical Labour Rate (per m2) | Labour Premium vs Straight Lay | Wastage Factor | Difficulty |
|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Straight lay (grid)** | $50-$80/m2 | Baseline | 10% | Standard |
| **Brick bond (1/2 offset)** | $55-$85/m2 | +5-10% | 10-12% | Standard |
| **1/3 offset** | $55-$85/m2 | +5-10% | 10-12% | Standard |
| **Diagonal (45-degree)** | $70-$110/m2 | +30-40% | 15-20% | Moderate |
| **Herringbone** | $90-$150/m2 | +50-80% | 15-20% | High |
| **Chevron** | $100-$160/m2 | +60-100% | 15-20% | High |
| **Basketweave** | $80-$120/m2 | +30-50% | 12-15% | Moderate |
| **Versailles / French pattern** | $90-$140/m2 | +50-80% | 10-15% | High (multiple sizes) |

**Why Herringbone Costs So Much More:**
1. **More cuts per m2:** Every edge of a herringbone layout requires an angled cut
2. **Layout precision:** The pattern must be perfectly aligned across the room. One misaligned tile creates a cascading error
3. **Slower pace:** A tiler might lay 15-20m2/day in straight lay but only 8-12m2/day in herringbone
4. **Starting point matters:** The herringbone pattern must be set out from a specific starting point (usually the centre of the room), requiring careful planning
5. **More adhesive:** Each small tile piece requires individual adhesive application

**Example Cost Difference (15m2 bathroom floor):**

| Pattern | Labour Only | Tile Waste Cost (tiles at $60/m2) | Total Premium |
|---------|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Straight lay | $750-$1,200 | $90-$135 (10-15%) | Baseline |
| Herringbone | $1,350-$2,250 | $135-$180 (15-20%) | **$645-$1,095 MORE** |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner gets a quote for herringbone tiling and is $1,000-$2,000 over budget
2. Homeowner tries to negotiate the tiler down on a complex pattern -- the tiler either refuses or cuts corners (misaligned pattern, poor cuts at edges)
3. Homeowner changes to a simpler pattern mid-renovation but has already bought tiles sized for herringbone (may not suit other patterns)

**How to Avoid It:**
- Decide on the laying pattern BEFORE getting quotes. Include the pattern in the quote request.
- Ask: "What is the labour rate difference between straight lay and herringbone for this area?"
- Budget for the pattern premium. If herringbone is important to you, plan for it financially.
- Consider using herringbone as a feature area (e.g., shower niche back wall, splashback) rather than entire floors -- this gives the look at a fraction of the cost.

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should list the laying pattern for each tiled area and apply the correct labour rate. If a complex pattern is selected, include a note: "Herringbone/chevron/diagonal patterns incur a [30-80]% labour premium over standard straight lay. Tile wastage also increases to [15-20]%."

---

### 8.1.7 Forgetting About Edge Finishing

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners focus on the tiles themselves and forget that wherever tiles end -- at door thresholds, around window reveals, on niche edges, at the top of a half-height tiled wall, around feature panels -- the exposed tile edge needs a finished treatment. Raw tile edges are ugly, sharp, and unprofessional.

**Why It Matters:**

Modern tiles (especially porcelain) have a printed/glazed face but the body (biscuit) of the tile is visible on cut edges. This raw edge is a different colour to the face and looks unfinished. Without edge treatment, the installation looks incomplete and amateurish.

**Edge Finishing Options:**

| Method | Description | Cost Range | Look | Best For |
|--------|------------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Metal trim (Schluter/aluminium)** | L-shaped or rounded metal strip embedded in the adhesive bed, covering the tile edge | $8-$20/linear metre (material); minimal extra labour | Clean, modern, minimal | Most common. Shower niches, window sills, half-height walls, splashback tops |
| **Bullnose tiles** | Factory-finished tile with one rounded edge. Must be ordered as a matching set with the main tile | $15-$40/linear metre (material, varies by tile range) | Traditional, finished, rounded | Traditional/heritage looks. Many modern tile ranges no longer offer bullnose. |
| **Mitred (45-degree) edge** | Two tile edges cut at 45 degrees and butted together to create a seamless external corner | $20-$50/linear metre (labour-intensive) | Premium, seamless, sharp | High-end bathrooms, external corners, shower niches. The most expensive option but the cleanest look. |
| **Pencil round trim** | Small rounded metal or ceramic trim piece | $5-$15/linear metre | Subtle, simple | Light-duty edges, splashback tops |
| **Raw/polished edge** | For rectified porcelain tiles: the cut edge is polished smooth. Only works with full-bodied porcelain (body colour matches surface). | No material cost; slight labour premium | Seamless if tile body matches face | Full-bodied porcelain only. Does NOT work with tiles where the body is a different colour to the face. |

**Where Edge Finishing Is Needed (commonly forgotten locations):**

| Location | What's Needed | Often Missed? |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Shower niche edges (all 3 sides + internal corners) | Metal trim or mitred edges | **Very commonly missed.** A niche has 6+ exposed edges. |
| Window reveal (splashback window) | Metal trim or bullnose | Frequently forgotten |
| Half-height wall tile termination | Metal trim along the top edge | Often forgotten -- tiles just stop with a raw edge |
| Door threshold (tile meets timber/carpet) | Transition strip or threshold trim | Often assumed to be "someone else's problem" |
| External wall corners | Metal trim or mitred edges | Often forgotten if only one wall is being tiled |
| Splashback top edge | Metal trim or pencil round | Frequently forgotten |
| Step/riser edges | Bullnose or metal trim (anti-slip recommended) | Safety issue if missed |
| Feature panel/accent wall border | Metal trim where feature tiles meet wall tiles | Often forgotten in design planning |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Tiler finishes the job and there are raw tile edges visible around the shower niche, window, and at the top of the splashback. Looks terrible.
2. Homeowner asks the tiler to add trim after the fact -- this often requires removing and re-laying edge tiles (metal trim must be embedded under the tile, not stuck on top).
3. Budget blowout: a shower with two niches, a window, and half-height walls can easily need 15-25 linear metres of trim. At $15-$50/lm, that's $225-$1,250 that wasn't in the budget.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Walk through the design and identify EVERY location where tiles terminate or meet a different surface
- Include edge finishing in the scope and quote -- specify the method and material
- Discuss with the tiler which edge treatment they recommend for each location
- For mitred edges: ensure the tiler has experience with this technique (it requires precision and practice)

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should include a line item for edge finishing at every tile termination point: "Edge finishing: [METHOD] at [LOCATION]. Material: [SPECIFY]. Include all shower niche edges, window reveals, half-height wall terminations, door thresholds, and splashback edges."

### 8.1.8 Assuming the Tiler Will Waterproof

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners assume that "tiling the bathroom" includes waterproofing, because it seems like part of the same job. They get a tiling quote and don't realise waterproofing is often a separate trade with separate licensing, separate inspection, and separate cost.

**Why It Matters:**

In most Australian states, waterproofing is a separately licensed trade. The licensing requirements differ by state:

| State | Waterproofing Licence Required? | Key Detail |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------|
| **NSW** | Yes -- separate licence required for work over $5,000 (labour + materials incl. GST) | Tilers can hold a dual licence. But many tilers do NOT hold a waterproofing licence. Must verify. |
| **QLD** | Yes -- QBCC licence for waterproofing work | Separate licence class from wall and floor tiling |
| **VIC** | Registration required for domestic building work | Waterproofing is part of registered domestic builder categories |
| **WA** | Yes -- Building Services (Waterproofing) registration | Separate from tiling registration |
| **SA** | Building work licence required | Less prescriptive but licence still needed |
| **TAS/ACT/NT** | Various requirements | Check state/territory authority |

**The Critical Sequencing Issue:**

Waterproofing must happen AFTER plumbing rough-in and BEFORE tiling. The sequence is:

1. **Plumbing rough-in** (pipes installed in walls/floor)
2. **Waterproofing membrane applied** (floor + walls to required heights)
3. **Waterproofing inspection** (mandatory in most jurisdictions before tiling can proceed)
4. **Tiling** (tiles laid on top of the cured, inspected membrane)

If the tiler is not licensed to waterproof, a separate waterproofer must be engaged between the plumber and the tiler. This is a scheduling coordination item that often gets missed.

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner gets a tiling quote and asks "does this include waterproofing?" The tiler says "no, that's separate." The homeowner now needs to find a waterproofer, adding $1,500-$3,500 to the budget.
2. Worse: the tiler says "yeah, I'll do it" but is not licensed to waterproof. No compliance certificate is issued. If a leak occurs, insurance won't cover it, and the homeowner has no legal recourse for the waterproofing.
3. The waterproofing inspection fails (common reasons: insufficient membrane height, unsealed penetrations, membrane not cured). Tiling is delayed while it's rectified.

**Waterproofing Cost (separate to tiling):**

| Area | Typical Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Standard bathroom (floor + walls to required heights) | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Shower only (floor + walls to ceiling) | $800-$1,500 |
| Laundry (floor only in most cases) | $500-$1,200 |
| Balcony / outdoor area | $1,500-$4,000+ (depends on size and complexity) |

**How to Avoid It:**
- Ask the tiler upfront: "Does your quote include waterproofing? Are you licensed to waterproof?"
- If the tiler is not licensed to waterproof, engage a separate waterproofer and coordinate the schedule
- Ensure a waterproofing compliance certificate is issued before tiling starts
- Budget for waterproofing as a separate line item

**Key warning for AI:** The scope MUST explicitly state whether waterproofing is included or excluded: "Waterproofing: [INCLUDED by tiler -- confirm tiler holds waterproofing licence] OR [EXCLUDED -- to be completed by separate licensed waterproofer before tiling commences. Homeowner to arrange.]" If the project involves any wet area (bathroom, shower, laundry, balcony), waterproofing is NOT optional.

## 8.2 Additional Common Mistakes

---

### 8.2.1 Not Checking Tile Lot/Batch Numbers

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners order tiles for a renovation and don't check that all boxes come from the same production batch (also called "lot" or "dye lot"). They receive tiles from multiple batches, and after installation discover noticeable colour and shade variations between different areas of the room.

**Why It Matters:**

Tiles are manufactured in batches. The batch number is printed on the side of each box. Because tiles are made from natural clay-based materials and fired in kilns, there are inherent variations between batches:

- **Raw material variation:** Clay composition differs slightly between batches
- **Kiln conditions:** Temperature, atmosphere, and firing time vary between runs
- **Glaze mixing:** Glaze thickness and consistency shift from one run to another
- **Ink/print variation:** Digital inkjet printing (used for wood-look, stone-look tiles) can shift between runs

These variations may be subtle when comparing two single tiles side-by-side, but become very noticeable when large areas are tiled -- especially under natural light, or when the light angle changes throughout the day.

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner orders 25 boxes. 20 arrive from batch A, 5 from batch B. The batch B tiles have a slightly warmer/cooler tone.
2. The tiler lays all batch A tiles on the floor and batch B on one wall. The colour difference is visible.
3. Homeowner is unhappy. The only fix is to remove the mismatched tiles and replace them -- $500-$2,000+ in wasted labour and materials.
4. Alternatively: homeowner orders 25 boxes, installs them all, then needs 3 more boxes. The reorder comes from a new batch and the colour doesn't match.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Check all boxes on delivery. Verify they have the SAME batch/lot number.
- If tiles arrive from different batches, request a swap from the supplier BEFORE the tiler starts.
- Buy all tiles at once, including wastage and spares. Don't plan to "top up" later.
- For natural stone: expect inherent variation between individual tiles (this is a feature, not a defect), but batch consistency for overall tone is still important.
- Ask the retailer at the time of order: "Can you guarantee all tiles from the same batch?"

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should include: "All tiles to be from the same production batch/lot number. Homeowner to verify batch numbers on delivery before tiling commences. Retain [4-6] spare tiles from the same batch for future repairs."

### 8.2.2 Choosing Matte/Textured Tiles for Kitchen Splashback

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners choose matte, textured, or heavily embossed tiles for the kitchen splashback behind the cooktop. These tiles look beautiful in the showroom but become a cleaning nightmare in a working kitchen.

**Why It Matters:**

The splashback behind a cooktop is the highest-grease-and-splash area in the kitchen. Cooking oil, tomato sauce, grease splatter, and steam hit this surface daily. Smooth, glossy tiles wipe clean easily. Matte and textured surfaces trap grease in their pores and texture, requiring aggressive scrubbing.

**Splashback Tile Surface Comparison:**

| Surface Type | Ease of Cleaning | Grease Resistance | Recommended for Splashback? |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Gloss/polished ceramic** | Excellent -- wipe with damp cloth | High -- smooth surface repels grease | YES -- best option |
| **Satin/semi-gloss** | Very good | Good | YES |
| **Matte porcelain (smooth)** | Good -- slightly more effort | Moderate | Acceptable with regular cleaning |
| **Matte textured/embossed** | Poor -- grease sits in texture | Low -- traps grease | NOT RECOMMENDED behind cooktop |
| **Handmade/artisan (uneven glaze)** | Moderate -- uneven surface holds dirt | Moderate | Use with caution; seal well |
| **Natural stone (marble, travertine)** | Poor without sealing; moderate with sealing | Low -- porous, absorbs oils | NOT RECOMMENDED without heavy sealing regime |
| **Subway tiles with wide grout** | Tiles OK; grout is the problem | Grout absorbs grease | Use epoxy grout behind cooktop |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner installs beautiful textured feature tiles behind the cooktop
2. Within months, grease builds up in the tile texture. Regular wiping doesn't remove it.
3. Aggressive cleaning products damage the tile surface or strip the colour
4. The splashback looks dirty and stained. Replacing it means demolishing tiles and re-tiling.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Use gloss or satin-finish tiles behind the cooktop
- If matte tiles are chosen for the overall kitchen, use a different (gloss) tile behind the cooktop area as a feature
- Use epoxy grout behind the cooktop regardless of tile type (grout is the weak point for grease absorption)
- Seal natural stone and handmade tiles before grouting AND after installation, then reseal annually

**Key warning for AI:** If the homeowner selects matte or textured tiles for a kitchen splashback, the scope should note: "Matte/textured tiles behind the cooktop area are harder to clean and may stain from cooking grease. Consider gloss/satin finish tiles for the splashback zone behind the cooktop. If proceeding with matte tiles, epoxy grout is strongly recommended."

---

### 8.2.3 Not Considering Ongoing Maintenance (Natural Stone)

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners choose natural stone tiles (marble, travertine, limestone, slate) because they love the look, without understanding the significant ongoing maintenance these materials require compared to ceramic or porcelain tiles.

**Why It Matters:**

Natural stone is porous. It absorbs liquids, stains from contact with acidic substances, and requires regular sealing to maintain its appearance. Porcelain and ceramic tiles are vitrified (near-zero porosity) and require virtually no maintenance beyond regular cleaning.

**Natural Stone Maintenance Comparison:**

| Stone Type | Porosity | Acid Sensitivity | Sealing Frequency | Common Problems |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Marble** | High | **Very high** -- acids etch the surface permanently (lemon, vinegar, wine, cola, coffee) | Every 6-12 months | Etching, staining, scratching. White marble stains from hair dye, cosmetics. |
| **Travertine** | High | High -- calcareous stone, same acid vulnerability as marble | Every 1-2 years | Etching, pitting (natural voids can trap dirt), staining from spills |
| **Limestone** | High | High -- calcareous | Every 1-2 years | Similar to travertine. Very soft -- scratches easily from grit/sand. |
| **Slate** | Low-moderate | Low-moderate | Every 2-3 years | Relatively hardy. May flake (delaminate) over time. Colour can fade. |
| **Granite** | Low | Low | Every 2-5 years | Most durable natural stone. Still needs occasional sealing. |
| **Porcelain** (for comparison) | Near-zero | None | **Never** | Virtually maintenance-free. This is why porcelain is dominant in Australia. |

**The Acid-Etching Problem (Marble, Travertine, Limestone):**

Acid etching is NOT a stain. It is a chemical reaction that physically dissolves the calcium carbonate in the stone surface. It creates a dull, rough mark that cannot be cleaned off -- it requires professional honing (grinding down the stone surface) to remove. Common household acids that cause etching:
- Lemon juice
- Vinegar
- Wine (red and white)
- Tomato sauce
- Cola and soft drinks
- Bathroom cleaners (most contain acid)
- Coffee

**Cost of Maintenance:**

| Maintenance Item | Typical Cost |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Professional sealing (per m2) | $15-$35/m2 |
| DIY sealer (product cost, per m2) | $5-$15/m2 |
| Professional honing to remove etching (per m2) | $30-$80/m2 |
| Full restoration (grind, hone, polish, seal) | $50-$120/m2 |
| pH-neutral stone-specific cleaner (per bottle) | $15-$30 |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner installs marble floor tiles in the bathroom. Uses standard bathroom cleaner (acidic). Marble etches and dulls within months.
2. Homeowner installs travertine in the kitchen. Red wine spills. Permanent stain.
3. Homeowner is told they need professional sealing every 12 months at $500-$1,500 per visit. This was not in the renovation budget.
4. Homeowner installs marble in a kids' bathroom. Cosmetics, hair dye, and bath products cause irreversible staining.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Understand the maintenance commitment BEFORE choosing natural stone
- Use natural stone only where you're willing to maintain it (e.g., feature wall in an ensuite you control)
- Avoid natural stone on kitchen floors, kids' bathrooms, and laundries
- Budget for ongoing sealing costs: $300-$1,000/year depending on area
- Always use pH-neutral, stone-specific cleaners. NEVER use vinegar, bleach, or standard bathroom/kitchen cleaners on natural stone.
- Consider stone-look porcelain tiles as an alternative -- same aesthetic with zero maintenance

**Key warning for AI:** If the homeowner selects natural stone tiles, the scope should include: "Natural stone tiles ([TYPE]) require: (1) professional sealing before grouting and after installation, (2) re-sealing every [6-24 months] depending on stone type and use, (3) pH-neutral cleaning products only -- standard household cleaners will damage the surface. Ongoing maintenance cost: approximately $[X]/year. Consider stone-look porcelain as a low-maintenance alternative."

### 8.2.4 DIY Tile Removal to Save Money

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners remove existing tiles themselves to save on demolition costs, not understanding the risks to the waterproofing membrane, the substrate, and their own health (asbestos exposure in pre-1990 homes).

**Why It Matters:**

There are three critical risks with DIY tile removal:

**Risk 1: Waterproofing Membrane Damage**

In bathrooms, laundries, and other wet areas, tiles are laid on top of a waterproofing membrane. This membrane is a thin sheet or liquid-applied coating that prevents water from entering the building structure. When tiles are removed:
- The removal process (chiselling, scraping, hammering) almost always damages or punctures the membrane
- A damaged membrane means the entire area must be re-waterproofed before new tiles can be laid
- Re-waterproofing costs $1,500-$3,500 and requires inspection before tiling
- The "savings" from DIY removal are wiped out by the mandatory re-waterproofing

**Risk 2: Asbestos Exposure (Pre-1990 Homes)**

In Australian homes built before 1990, asbestos may be present in:
- Tile adhesives (especially black mastic adhesive)
- Backing sheets behind tiles
- Substrate materials (fibro sheeting)
- Vinyl floor tiles under ceramic tiles

Disturbing asbestos-containing materials (sanding, drilling, chiselling, breaking) releases microscopic fibres that cause fatal diseases (mesothelioma, asbestosis). In Australia:
- Removing more than 10m2 of non-friable asbestos requires a licensed asbestos removalist
- Removing ANY amount of friable asbestos requires a Class A asbestos licence
- DIY asbestos removal is illegal in most circumstances and carries heavy fines
- There is NO safe level of asbestos exposure

**Risk 3: Substrate Damage**

Aggressive tile removal can damage the substrate underneath:
- Plasterboard: easily gouged, dented, or broken through
- Cement sheet: can crack and delaminate
- Concrete: minimal risk, but can be uneven after removal
- Timber: can be scored and weakened

A damaged substrate must be repaired or replaced before new tiles can be laid -- adding cost and time.

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner hires a jackhammer to remove bathroom tiles. Waterproof membrane is destroyed. Mandatory re-waterproofing: $2,000+
2. Homeowner starts chiselling tiles in a 1970s bathroom. Old adhesive contains asbestos. They've exposed themselves and their family to asbestos fibres.
3. Homeowner removes tiles and damages the plasterboard. Entire wall needs re-sheeting: $500-$1,500+

**How to Avoid It:**
- **ALWAYS get an asbestos assessment before demolishing ANYTHING in a pre-1990 home.** Cost: $200-$500 for testing.
- Hire a professional for tile removal. They understand how to remove tiles while minimising substrate damage.
- Accept that waterproofing will likely need to be re-done in wet areas regardless of how carefully tiles are removed.
- Budget for demolition as part of the renovation cost, not as a DIY shortcut.

**Key warning for AI:** If the renovation involves removing existing tiles, the scope should include: "Tile removal: [PROFESSIONAL REMOVAL RECOMMENDED]. For homes built before 1990: asbestos testing of existing tile adhesive and substrate is required before any demolition. Cost for asbestos testing: $200-$500. In wet areas: waterproofing membrane will likely require replacement after tile removal -- budget accordingly."

---

### 8.2.5 Mixing Tiles from Different Suppliers/Ranges

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners buy tiles from two different suppliers or two different ranges (e.g., floor tiles from Beaumont and wall tiles from a discount online store) and assume they'll work together because they "look similar."

**Why It Matters:**

Tiles from different manufacturers or ranges may differ in:

| Property | What Can Go Wrong |
|----------|------------------|
| **Thickness** | Different thickness = lippage at junctions. Australian standard allows +/- 0.6% variance from nominal size, but between different manufacturers this can mean 1-3mm thickness difference. Requires additional adhesive build-up and levelling. |
| **Calibration (actual size)** | A "300x600" tile from one manufacturer may be 298x598, while another's is 301x602. Grout joints won't align where tiles meet. |
| **Colour tone** | "White" from Manufacturer A is not the same "white" from Manufacturer B. Under natural light, the difference is obvious. |
| **Rectification** | One tile range may be rectified (precision-cut edges, 1.5-2mm joints possible) while the other is non-rectified (3-5mm joints required). Incompatible joint widths at transitions. |
| **Surface finish** | "Matte" has different textures between manufacturers. "Gloss" has different reflectivity. |
| **Coefficient of expansion** | Different materials expand/contract at different rates. Where they meet (e.g., floor-to-wall junction), this can cause cracking or lifting over time. |

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner buys floor tiles from one store and matching wall tiles from another. The "matching" colours are noticeably different once installed.
2. Floor tiles are 10mm thick, wall tiles are 8mm thick. Where they meet at the floor-wall junction, there's a visible step.
3. Floor tiles are rectified (1.5mm joints), wall tiles are non-rectified (4mm joints). The grout lines don't align at the transition.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Buy all tiles for a room from the same manufacturer/range whenever possible
- If mixing is unavoidable, bring physical samples together and compare under natural daylight
- Check thickness, calibration, and rectification status of every tile being used
- Discuss with the tiler before purchasing -- they can identify potential installation issues
- Accept that floor and wall tiles don't need to "match" -- they can complement each other from different ranges, but the design should be intentional, not accidental

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should note for each room: "All tiles from [MANUFACTURER/RANGE] to ensure consistent thickness, calibration, and colour tone. If tiles are sourced from multiple suppliers, confirm compatibility of thickness, calibration, and rectification status before purchasing."

---

### 8.2.6 Not Understanding Rectified vs Non-Rectified Tiles

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners choose tiles based on appearance and price without understanding whether they're rectified or non-rectified, and what this means for the grout joint width and final appearance.

**Why It Matters:**

| Property | Rectified Tiles | Non-Rectified Tiles |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Edge treatment** | Machine-cut to precise dimensions after firing | Natural edges, slight size variation between tiles |
| **Size tolerance** | Very tight (+/- 0.2-0.5mm) | Wider (+/- 1-2mm) |
| **Minimum grout joint** | 1.5-2mm achievable | 3-5mm minimum required |
| **Final look** | Sleek, minimal grout lines, modern | More visible grout lines, traditional/rustic |
| **Substrate requirement** | Must be perfectly flat (tight joints show every substrate imperfection) | More forgiving of minor substrate irregularities |
| **Installation difficulty** | Harder -- less room for adjustment | Easier -- wider joints allow for adjustment |
| **Cost** | Typically 10-30% more expensive than non-rectified | Standard pricing |

**The Expectation Problem:**

Homeowners see Instagram photos of tiled bathrooms with hair-thin grout lines and assume this is achievable with any tile. They buy non-rectified tiles and ask the tiler for 1.5mm grout joints. The tiler explains that the tile's edge variation means 3-5mm joints are required. The homeowner is disappointed.

Conversely, homeowners buy rectified tiles without understanding that tight grout joints require a perfectly flat substrate. If the substrate has minor undulations, the tight joints will highlight every imperfection (lippage).

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner wants the "minimal grout" look but buys non-rectified tiles. Joints must be 3-5mm -- not the look they wanted.
2. Homeowner buys rectified tiles for a 1960s bathroom with an uneven floor. The tiler needs to apply levelling compound first ($25-$50/m2 extra) to achieve the flat substrate required.
3. Homeowner asks tiler to set non-rectified tiles with 1.5mm joints. Tiler does it. Tiles look misaligned because the size variation is magnified by the tight joints.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Ask at the point of purchase: "Are these tiles rectified or non-rectified?"
- If you want minimal grout lines (1.5-2mm), you MUST choose rectified tiles
- If you choose rectified tiles, budget for substrate preparation (levelling compound)
- If you're on a budget, non-rectified tiles with a complementary 3mm grout joint look perfectly good

**Key warning for AI:** The scope should specify: "Tile type: [RECTIFIED / NON-RECTIFIED]. Grout joint width: [X]mm." If rectified tiles are specified with tight joints, add: "Substrate must be flat within 3mm over 2m. Levelling compound may be required: estimated $25-$50/m2 if needed."

---

### 8.2.7 Ignoring Tile Weight for Wall and Upper Floor Applications

**Confidence:** HIGH

**The Mistake:** Homeowners choose heavy tiles (large format porcelain, natural stone) for walls or upper-storey floors without considering whether the substrate or structure can support the weight.

**Why It Matters:**

Wall substrates have maximum weight limits for tiling. Exceeding these limits can cause tiles to debond (fall off the wall) or, in severe cases, structural damage to the wall itself.

**Wall Substrate Weight Limits:**

| Substrate Type | Maximum Tiling Weight (tile + adhesive + grout) |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Gypsum plaster (skim coat) | 20 kg/m2 |
| Gypsum plasterboard (direct fix) | 32 kg/m2 |
| Plywood (WBP grade) | 30 kg/m2 |
| Fibre cement sheet (Villaboard, etc.) | 40-50 kg/m2 |
| Cement render on masonry | 50+ kg/m2 |
| Lightweight tile backer board | 40 kg/m2 |

**Tile Weight by Material (approximate, per mm of thickness):**

| Material | Weight per m2 per mm thickness |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Ceramic | 1.75 kg/m2/mm |
| Porcelain | 2.40 kg/m2/mm |
| Marble | 2.56 kg/m2/mm |
| Granite | 2.69 kg/m2/mm |
| Limestone | 2.61 kg/m2/mm |

**Example Calculation: 600x1200x10mm Porcelain on Plasterboard Wall**

- Tile weight: 2.40 x 10 = 24.0 kg/m2
- Adhesive (3mm bed): 2.16 x 3 = 6.5 kg/m2
- **Total: 30.5 kg/m2** -- just under the 32 kg/m2 plasterboard limit

If the adhesive bed is thicker (6mm, which is common with large format tiles for levelling):
- Total: 24.0 + 13.0 = **37.0 kg/m2** -- EXCEEDS plasterboard limit

**What Goes Wrong:**
1. Homeowner installs 600x1200mm porcelain tiles on plasterboard walls with a thick adhesive bed. Total weight exceeds plasterboard capacity. Tiles debond over time (especially in the shower where moisture weakens the plasterboard).
2. Homeowner installs marble tiles on plasterboard. Marble is 25-30% heavier than ceramic. Combined with adhesive, it exceeds the weight limit.
3. Homeowner installs heavy tiles on an upper floor. While the floor structure handles it, the ceiling below develops cracks from the added dead load.

**How to Avoid It:**
- Calculate the total installed weight (tile + adhesive + grout) before committing to heavy tiles on walls
- For wall tiling in wet areas: use fibre cement sheet (Villaboard or similar) as the substrate, NOT plasterboard
- For heavy tiles on walls: consider tile backer board, which supports 40 kg/m2
- For upper storey floors: consult a structural engineer if adding stone or large-format porcelain (particularly in older homes with lightweight floor framing)
- Ask the tiler: "Are my walls suitable for this tile weight?"

**Key warning for AI:** If the homeowner selects large-format porcelain (over 600mm any dimension) or natural stone for wall applications, the scope should include: "Confirm wall substrate can support combined weight of tile + adhesive (estimated [X] kg/m2). Standard plasterboard supports maximum 32 kg/m2. Fibre cement sheet (Villaboard) or tile backer board may be required for heavy tile installations. [If applicable: structural assessment recommended for upper-storey floor installations with heavy tiles.]"

## 8.3 Red Flags in a Tiler's Quote

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent themes across Australian trade, consumer protection, and renovation advisory sources)

A tiling quote for a renovation should be detailed enough to compare like-for-like with other quotes and clear enough that both parties know exactly what's included and excluded. The following are red flags that indicate a quote may be incomplete, unreliable, or designed to win the job with a low price and make up the difference in variations.

---

### 8.3.1 Red Flags That Indicate Missing Scope

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean | What a Good Quote Should Say |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| **No mention of substrate preparation** | The tiler hasn't assessed the condition of the existing surface. Uneven, damaged, or unsuitable substrates need prep work (levelling compound, cement render, backer board). If not in the quote, it will be a "variation" later. | "Includes: surface preparation -- [levelling compound / cement render / backer board] to achieve flat substrate within 3mm over 2m. OR: Quote assumes substrate is flat and ready for tiling. Any levelling/preparation required will be quoted as a variation at $[X]/m2." |
| **No mention of waterproofing status** | The tiler hasn't addressed who is responsible for waterproofing in wet areas. This is a critical scope boundary. | "Waterproofing: [INCLUDED -- tiler holds waterproofing licence #XXXX] OR [EXCLUDED -- to be completed by others before tiling. Tiler requires waterproofing compliance certificate before commencing tiling.]" |
| **No mention of grout type or colour** | The tiler will use whatever they have on the truck -- usually the cheapest cement-based grout in the most common colour. | "Grout: [BRAND, COLOUR, TYPE -- e.g., Mapei Keracolor FF, colour #111 Silver Grey, cement-based]. OR: Epoxy grout [BRAND, COLOUR] for wet areas." |
| **No exclusions section** | Every tiling quote should explicitly list what is NOT included. No exclusions means the tiler hasn't thought through the scope properly. | "Excludes: [waterproofing / demolition / disposal / substrate preparation / edge trim supply / fixture removal and reinstallation / etc.]" |
| **"Price per tile" instead of "price per m2"** | Non-standard pricing that makes comparison impossible. Industry standard in Australia is price per square metre for labour. | "Labour: $[X] per m2. Tiles: owner-supplied OR tiles supplied at $[X] per m2." |
| **No mention of movement joints** | Movement joints (flexible sealant joints, not grout) are required per AS 3958 at perimeters, changes in substrate, and at regular intervals in large areas (typically every 4.5m internal, 3m external). Omitting them causes cracking and lifting. | "Movement joints: installed at all perimeter junctions, substrate changes, and at maximum [4.5m] centres per AS 3958. Sealant: [BRAND, COLOUR]." |
| **No mention of edge finishing** | The tiler hasn't addressed how tile terminations will be finished. Raw edges will be left exposed. | "Edge finishing: [aluminium trim / Schluter profile / mitred edges / bullnose] at [all exposed edges / shower niches / window reveals / half-height walls]. Material: [SPECIFY]." |
| **No tile layout/pattern specified** | The tiler will lay the tiles in whatever pattern is easiest (usually straight lay). If the homeowner wanted herringbone or a specific offset, it needs to be in the quote. | "Laying pattern: [straight lay / brick bond 50% offset / 1/3 offset / herringbone / diagonal]. Layout to be set out and approved by homeowner before tiling commences." |
| **No mention of adhesive type** | Different tiles and substrates require different adhesives. The wrong adhesive causes failure. | "Adhesive: [BRAND, TYPE -- e.g., Mapei Kerabond T + Keralastic, flexible adhesive for large format porcelain on fibre cement]. Back-buttering: [YES for large format tiles / NO]." |
| **No site visit before quoting** | A tiler who quotes sight-unseen is guessing. Substrate condition, access, complexity, and existing conditions all affect price. | "Quote based on site inspection on [DATE] and assessment of existing conditions." |

---

### 8.3.2 Red Flags That Indicate a Suspiciously Low Price

| Red Flag | What It Likely Means |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Significantly lower than other quotes (>25-30% below)** | Either missing scope items, planning to cut corners (poor adhesive coverage, no back-buttering, skipping movement joints), or intending to claim variations. Compare line-by-line. |
| **Labour rate below $40/m2 for standard tiling** | Industry standard for floor tiling in Australia (2025-2026) is $50-$80/m2 for standard work. Below $40/m2 suggests unlicensed work, inadequate adhesive application, or a bait-and-switch quote. |
| **No mention of back-buttering for large format tiles** | Large format tiles (over 300x300mm or any dimension over 600mm) require both bed adhesive and back-buttering to achieve the mandatory 100% adhesive coverage. Skipping this is a major shortcut that causes hollow tiles and eventual debonding. AS 3958 requires minimum 80-100% adhesive coverage. |
| **"Cash price" or "discount for cash"** | May indicate unregistered/unlicensed work, no GST compliance, and no paper trail. If something goes wrong, you have limited legal recourse. |
| **No mention of materials (adhesive, grout, primer)** | The tiler may be planning to use the cheapest available products, or may add materials as an "extra" later. |
| **Unusually short timeline** | If three tilers quote 4-5 days for a bathroom and one quotes 2 days, the 2-day tiler is either understaffing or cutting corners on preparation and curing times. |

**Benchmark: What a Bathroom Tiling Job Should Cost (Labour Only)**

For a standard bathroom (approximately 15-20m2 of tiling including floor and walls):

| Component | Expected Range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Floor tiling (standard straight lay) | $50-$80/m2 |
| Wall tiling (standard straight lay) | $55-$85/m2 |
| Large format tiling (600x1200+) | $80-$150/m2 |
| Feature pattern (herringbone etc.) | $90-$150/m2 |
| Shower niche tiling (per niche) | $150-$400 |
| **Total labour for standard bathroom** | **$1,500-$3,500** |

If a quote comes in under $1,000 for a standard bathroom, it's almost certainly missing scope items or cutting corners.

---

### 8.3.3 Reasonable vs Unreasonable Exclusions

**Reasonable exclusions (industry standard):**
- Supply of tiles (typically owner-supplied; or quoted separately)
- Waterproofing (if tiler does not hold waterproofing licence)
- Demolition/removal of existing tiles (often a separate trade or priced separately)
- Disposal of demolition waste (skip bin hire)
- Plumbing and electrical work (separate licensed trades)
- Painting, carpentry, plastering (other trades)
- Shower screen installation (separate trade)
- Furniture/fixture removal and protection
- Council permits

**Unreasonable exclusions (hiding costs):**
- Excluding adhesive, grout, or primer (these are standard tiling materials -- should be included in a "supply and fix" quote)
- Excluding substrate preparation without noting the substrate is assumed to be ready
- Excluding edge finishing without discussing alternatives
- Excluding movement joints (required by AS 3958 -- must be included)
- "Excludes any additional work" (too vague -- this is a blank cheque for variations)
- Excluding cleanup of own work area
- Excluding cut tiles at edges (this is part of tiling -- all rooms have edges)
- Excluding back-buttering (required for large format and wet area tiles)

---

### 8.3.4 Red Flags in Tiler Behaviour

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|--------------|
| **Won't provide licence number** | May not be licensed. In NSW, tiling work over $5,000 requires a licence (check at Service NSW). In QLD, all tiling work requires a QBCC licence. Verify at your state's authority. |
| **No written quote -- verbal only** | No legal protection. NSW requires a written contract for work over $5,000 (incl. GST). |
| **Demands full payment upfront** | Industry standard is a deposit (10-20%) with progress or completion payments. Full upfront payment gives you no leverage. |
| **Can't show examples of previous work** | An experienced tiler will have photos of completed jobs, especially complex patterns or large-format work. |
| **Dismisses your tile choice as "too hard"** | While some tile/pattern combinations ARE harder (and legitimately cost more), a skilled tiler should be able to handle most residential work. "Too hard" may mean "I don't have the skills for this." |
| **No evidence of insurance** | Public liability insurance (minimum $5M recommended) should be held by any tiler working on your property. |
| **Won't discuss grout type or colour** | Indicates they plan to use whatever is convenient, not what's best for the job. |
| **Plans to start tiling without checking substrate flatness** | Professional tilers check substrate flatness with a straight edge before starting. Skipping this step leads to lippage and hollow tiles. |

---

### 8.3.5 Questions Homeowners Should Ask Before Accepting a Tiling Quote

1. "Are you licensed? Can I have your licence number to verify?" (Check at state authority: NSW Fair Trading, QBCC, VBA, etc.)
2. "Do you hold a waterproofing licence? Will you be doing the waterproofing, or do I need a separate waterproofer?"
3. "Do you hold current public liability insurance? What's the coverage amount?"
4. "Does this quote include all adhesive, grout, primer, and edge trim materials?"
