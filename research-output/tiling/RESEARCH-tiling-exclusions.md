# Tiling Scope Research — Section 6: Common Exclusions & Assumptions
## Australian Residential Renovations

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Reference document for AI scope-of-works generator (ScopeAI) — Section 6: Common Exclusions & Assumptions for tiling trade scopes
**Coverage:** Kitchen, bathroom, laundry, living area, and outdoor tiling exclusions in residential renovation scopes across all Australian states and territories
**Target Audience:** AI prompt system that generates trade-specific scope-of-works documents for Australian homeowners

**Confidence Notes:**
- **HIGH** — Items marked HIGH are based on established Australian trade practice, statutory requirements, published standards (AS 3958:2023, NCC/BCA), state regulator guidance (NSW Fair Trading, VBA, QBCC), and multiple corroborating industry sources.
- **MEDIUM** — Items marked MEDIUM are based on common industry practice confirmed by trade publications and renovation cost guides, but may vary by region, tiler, or contract type.
- **LOW** — Items marked LOW are based on general industry knowledge where published Australian-specific sources are limited; treated as reasonable estimates pending further verification.

> **Why this section is critical:** The exclusions section of a tiling scope is the single most important section for preventing disputes. Tiling is the most visible trade in a renovation — the homeowner sees and touches the tiler's work every day. Because of this visibility, tiling generates a disproportionate number of complaints to NSW Fair Trading, NCAT, VCAT, and QCAT. The majority of disputes stem not from poor workmanship but from misunderstandings about what was and was not included in the tiling quote. Homeowners routinely assume that "bathroom tiling" includes tile supply, waterproofing, floor levelling, tile removal, sealing, and making good damaged walls — few of which are standard tiling inclusions. A well-drafted exclusions section protects both the homeowner (who can budget accurately and arrange other trades) and the tiler (who is not expected to deliver work outside their quoted scope). The AI scope generator must include clear, explicit exclusions in every tiling scope it produces.

## 6.1 Tile Supply

### What It Is

Tile supply refers to the physical tiles themselves — the ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, terrazzo, or mosaic tiles that are fixed to walls and floors. This is distinct from the tiler's consumable materials (adhesive, grout, silicone, primers, backer board, waterproofing membrane) which are typically included in the tiling quote.

### Why Tile Supply Is Typically Excluded from a Tiling Scope

In Australian residential renovation practice, tile supply is overwhelmingly treated as an **owner-selected, owner-supplied** item. This is standard for several critical reasons:

1. **Personal design choice:** Tiles are the single most visible design element in a bathroom, kitchen, or laundry renovation. Homeowners select tiles based on colour, size, format, texture, pattern, and brand. A tiler cannot anticipate these preferences, and selection is almost always done by the homeowner (often with an interior designer or from a tile showroom).

2. **Massive price variance:** The cost difference between budget and premium tiles is enormous and dwarfs the labour component of most tiling jobs:

| Tile Type | Budget (per m2) | Mid-Range (per m2) | Premium (per m2) | Luxury (per m2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ceramic wall tile | $20-$40 | $40-$70 | $70-$120 | $120-$200+ |
| Porcelain floor tile (standard format) | $25-$50 | $50-$90 | $90-$150 | $150-$300+ |
| Porcelain floor tile (large format 600x600+) | $35-$70 | $70-$120 | $120-$200 | $200-$400+ |
| Natural stone (marble, travertine, limestone) | $60-$100 | $100-$200 | $200-$400 | $400-$800+ |
| Mosaic tile (per sheet/per m2) | $30-$60 | $60-$120 | $120-$250 | $250-$500+ |
| Subway tile (standard 75x150 to 100x300) | $20-$40 | $40-$80 | $80-$150 | $150-$300+ |
| Terrazzo tile | $80-$150 | $150-$250 | $250-$400 | $400+ |
| Encaustic/patterned tile | $60-$100 | $100-$200 | $200-$350 | $350+ |

Including tile supply in a tiling quote introduces unacceptable price ambiguity. A 15m2 bathroom floor could cost $375 in budget porcelain or $6,000+ in premium natural stone — both are legitimate choices, but neither should be hidden inside a "tiling quote."

3. **Availability and lead times:** Many tile selections are imported and can have lead times of 4-12 weeks. If the tiler is responsible for supply and the tile is delayed, the entire project stalls. When the owner supplies tiles, the owner manages lead time risk.

4. **Batch matching:** Tiles from different batches can have slight colour variation (especially natural stone, handmade tiles, and some porcelains). Homeowners need to ensure all tiles come from the same batch. This is best managed by the person selecting the tiles.

5. **Returns and credits:** If tiles are owner-supplied, unused tiles can be returned to the retailer (subject to store policy). If the tiler supplies tiles, returns become more complicated.

### How This Is Handled in Scope Language

| Approach | Scope Language | When Used | Implications |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Labour only — owner-supplied tiles** | "Supply and fix all tiling to [area]. Owner to supply all tiles to site prior to commencement. Tiler to supply all adhesive, grout, silicone, primers, and sundry materials." | Most common approach in renovations. Homeowner selects and purchases tiles from retail or trade suppliers. | Tiler is responsible for installation quality only. Tile supply cost is entirely separate from the tiling quote. Tiler may advise on tile suitability but is not responsible for tile selection. |
| **Supply and install** | "Supply and install [specific tile — brand, range, colour, size, finish] to [area]. Tile supply cost: $X/m2. Installation included." | Less common. Used when the tiler has a trade account or offers a package. More common with tiling firms (as opposed to sole-trader tilers). | Tiler carries responsibility for both supply and installation. Tile is usually purchased at trade pricing with a margin. Any tile defects become a three-way issue (tiler, supplier, manufacturer). |
| **Labour only with PC (Provisional Cost) sum for tiles** | "Supply and fix all tiling to [area]. Provisional allowance of $X/m2 for tile supply. Final cost adjusted based on owner's selection." | Used in builder-managed renovations where the tiler is a subcontractor and the builder needs a total contract price. | Builder includes an estimated tile cost. If the homeowner's selection exceeds the PC sum, they pay the difference. If it costs less, they receive a credit. Builder's margin typically applies. |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners frequently see a "tiling quote" of $3,000-$8,000 for a bathroom and assume it includes the tiles. When they then receive a separate bill of $1,500-$5,000+ for tile supply, they feel blindsided. The scope must make it unmistakably clear whether tiles are included or excluded, and if excluded, provide guidance on the typical tile budget for the project.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Default to **"labour only — owner-supplied tiles"** unless context indicates otherwise.
- Always include a line item noting: "Tile supply by owner. All tiles to be delivered to site prior to tiler's commencement date."
- Include a note about wastage allowance (see Section 6.10).
- Include a note about tile suitability: "Owner to confirm tile selection is suitable for the intended application (e.g., slip rating for wet area floors, frost resistance for outdoor use). Tiler to advise but is not responsible for suitability of owner-selected tiles."
- If a PC sum approach is used, state the PC amount clearly and note the adjustment mechanism.

## 6.2 Waterproofing

### What It Is

Waterproofing is the application of a waterproof membrane system to wet areas (bathrooms, showers, laundries, balconies) to prevent water penetration into the building structure. In Australian residential renovations, waterproofing is required by the National Construction Code (NCC) — specifically NCC Volume Two (BCA) for Class 1 and 10 buildings — in all wet areas before tiling can commence. The waterproofing system typically involves a liquid-applied or sheet membrane to floors and wall junctions, with bond-breaker tape at internal corners and around penetrations (pipes, floor wastes).

### Why Waterproofing Is Typically Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Separate licensing requirements by state:** Waterproofing and tiling are treated as separate trades in most Australian states. The licensing implications are significant:

| State/Territory | Tiling Licence | Waterproofing Licence | Can a Tiler Do Waterproofing? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Wall and Floor Tiling contractor licence (over $5,000 incl GST) | Construction Waterproofing contractor licence (over $5,000 incl GST) | Only if they also hold a waterproofing licence. Tiling licence alone does NOT authorise waterproofing. |
| **QLD** | WFT (Wall Floor Tiling) licence via QBCC (over $3,300 incl GST) | WP (Waterproofing) licence via QBCC (over $3,300 incl GST) | Only if they also hold a WP licence. Many QLD tilers hold both WFT and WP. |
| **VIC** | Tiling licence via VBA (over $5,000 incl GST) | Waterproofing licence via VBA (over $5,000 incl GST) | Only if they also hold a waterproofing licence. |
| **SA** | Building work licence via CBS (over $5,000 incl GST) | Included under building work licence (wet area waterproofing) | Potentially, if licenced appropriately. |
| **WA** | Building Service Registration via DMIRS | Building Service Registration (waterproofing) | Only if registered for waterproofing. |
| **TAS** | Building licence via CBOS | Building licence (waterproofing class) | Depends on licence class held. |
| **ACT** | Building licence via Access Canberra | Building licence (waterproofing class) | Depends on licence class held. |
| **NT** | Building Practitioner registration via NT Building Practitioners Board | Registration (waterproofing class) | Depends on registration class. |

2. **Separate warranty and liability:** Waterproofing failures are the single most expensive defect in residential construction. A failed waterproofing membrane behind tiles can cause tens of thousands of dollars in structural damage, mould remediation, and neighbour disputes (in apartments). The waterproofer carries specific liability for membrane integrity. If the tiler also waterproofs, they carry dual liability — most tilers prefer to avoid this.

3. **Inspection hold point:** In many jurisdictions, waterproofing must be inspected and certified (often by a building certifier or the waterproofer themselves) before tiling can commence. This is a mandatory hold point — tiling cannot begin until the waterproofing certificate is issued. This creates a natural scope boundary.

4. **Different skill set and materials:** Waterproofing involves specific membrane products (e.g., Ardex WPM 300, Mapei Mapelastic AquaDefense, Sika AquaBlock), bond-breaker tape, puddle flanges, hob connections, and knowledge of fall requirements. While many experienced tilers CAN do waterproofing, it is a distinct skill.

5. **Cost separation:** Waterproofing for a standard bathroom (shower + floor) typically costs $1,200-$3,000 for labour and materials. This is a significant cost that should be visible to the homeowner, not buried inside a "tiling" quote.

### How This Is Handled in Scope Language

| Scenario | Scope Language | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Waterproofing excluded entirely** | "Waterproofing to all wet areas is excluded from this tiling scope. Waterproofing must be completed and certified by a licensed waterproofer prior to tiling commencement. Tiler to verify waterproofing certificate is in place before commencing work." | Most common approach. Clean separation of trades. |
| **Waterproofing quoted separately by the same tiler** | "Waterproofing: quoted separately — see Waterproofing Scope of Works. Tiling will not commence until waterproofing has been inspected, certified, and cured for the manufacturer's specified period." | Common where the tiler also holds a waterproofing licence. Two separate line items on the same invoice. |
| **Waterproofing by others — tiler verifies** | "Tiler to visually inspect waterproofing membrane prior to tiling. Any concerns regarding membrane integrity, falls, or coverage to be raised with builder/project manager before tiling commences. Tiler accepts no liability for waterproofing defects." | Important CYA clause for tilers. |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners frequently assume that "bathroom tiling" includes waterproofing. When the waterproofing quote arrives as a separate $1,500-$3,000 line item, they feel it should have been included. The tiling scope must explicitly state that waterproofing is a separate trade, a separate quote, and must be completed before tiling begins.

### What the AI Scope Generator Should Do

- Always exclude waterproofing from the tiling scope by default.
- Always include a note stating: "All waterproofing to be completed, inspected, and certified by a licensed waterproofer prior to tiling commencement."
- If the project involves wet areas (bathroom, shower, laundry floor, balcony), flag that waterproofing is a prerequisite.
- Never assume the tiler will waterproof unless the project context explicitly states this.

## 6.3 Substrate Preparation Beyond Normal

### What It Is

Substrate preparation is the work required to make walls and floors ready to receive tiles. The "substrate" (or "background") is whatever the tile is fixed to — concrete slab, cement render, plasterboard (villaboard/fibre cement or standard gyprock), timber floor with tile underlay, compressed fibre cement (CFC) sheet, or existing tiles.

### What Constitutes "Normal" (Standard) Substrate Prep — Usually INCLUDED

Under AS 3958:2023 (Guide to the installation of ceramic and stone tiles), the tiler is expected to check the substrate before commencing work and carry out reasonable preparation. Standard substrate prep that is typically **included** in a tiling quote:

| Standard Prep Item | What It Involves | Why It's Included |
|---|---|---|
| **Surface cleaning** | Removing dust, loose debris, paint splatters, and minor contaminants from the substrate | Basic trade requirement per AS 3958 |
| **Priming** | Applying a primer coat (e.g., Ardex P51, Davco Primer) to improve adhesion and control suction | Standard step in every tile installation |
| **Minor levelling with adhesive** | Using notch-trowelled adhesive to accommodate minor substrate undulations (up to 3-5mm variation in 2m) | Within normal tiling adhesive bed thickness tolerance |
| **Checking flatness/plumb** | Using a straightedge to verify substrate meets acceptable tolerances per AS 3958 | Tiler's professional responsibility to assess before starting |
| **Cutting around standard penetrations** | Standard cuts for a reasonable number of pipes, power points, and fittings | Normal part of any tiling job |
| **Application of silicone at junctions** | Silicone sealant at tile-to-fixture junctions, internal corners, and change-of-plane joints | Standard finishing requirement |

### What Constitutes "Abnormal" Prep — Usually EXCLUDED

| Abnormal Prep Item | What It Involves | Why It's Excluded | Typical Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Extensive slab grinding** | Mechanical grinding to flatten a concrete slab that is significantly out of level (>5mm in 2m) | Specialist equipment and labour; not a tiling skill | $25-$50/m2 |
| **Structural repairs to substrate** | Repairing cracked concrete, replacing rotten timber framing, re-rendering failed render coats | Builder/carpenter/renderer scope, not tiler | Varies widely |
| **Major floor levelling** (>10mm depth) | Pumping or pouring self-levelling compound to correct significant slab or floor irregularities | Specialist product, significant material cost, often requires screeding equipment | $30-$65/m2 (see Section 6.7) |
| **Asbestos removal** | Removing asbestos-containing substrate, adhesive, or sheeting | Licensed asbestos removalist required by law (see Section 6.12) | $50-$150/m2 |
| **Installing tile underlay on timber floors** | Fixing compressed fibre cement (CFC) sheets (e.g., James Hardie Villaboard) to timber framing to create a suitable tiling substrate | Separate trade item (carpentry/building work) | $25-$45/m2 installed |
| **Render removal and re-rendering** | Removing failed or unsuitable render and applying new render coat to walls | Renderer/plasterer scope | $40-$80/m2 |
| **Installing backer board/Wedi board** | Fixing waterproof backer board systems to walls (e.g., Wedi board, Kerdi board) for shower recesses | Specialist product and installation; sometimes included in waterproofing scope | $50-$100/m2 installed |
| **Removing existing paint or coatings** | Stripping paint, sealers, or coatings that would prevent adhesive bond | Additional labour; sometimes the cause of the coating is unknown (lead paint risk) | $15-$30/m2 |

### AS 3958 Substrate Flatness Tolerances

The tiler's obligation under AS 3958:2023 is to check the substrate and advise if it does not meet acceptable tolerances. The tiler is NOT obligated to fix a substrate that someone else has prepared badly. Key tolerances:

| Measurement | Tolerance (AS 3958) | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Floor flatness | +/- 4mm in 2m (straightedge measurement) for the finished tiled surface | If the substrate is already out by more than what adhesive bed can correct, levelling is required BEFORE tiling |
| Wall plumb | +/- 4mm in 2m (plumb line measurement) for the finished tiled surface | Significantly out-of-plumb walls require re-rendering or furring out |
| Substrate for large format tiles (600x600+) | Much tighter tolerances needed in practice — 3mm in 3m is commonly cited | Large format tiles amplify substrate imperfections; substrate prep is more critical |

### Scope Language

**Included:** "Standard substrate preparation including cleaning, priming, and minor levelling within normal adhesive bed thickness (up to 5mm) is included."

**Excluded:** "Substrate preparation beyond normal is excluded from this scope, including but not limited to: slab grinding, structural repairs, floor levelling exceeding [5-10]mm, installation of tile underlay (CFC sheet), removal and replacement of render, and installation of backer board systems. If abnormal substrate conditions are discovered during work, the tiler will advise the owner and provide a separate quote for additional preparation required."

### Key Dispute Point

The most common substrate dispute occurs when a tiler arrives to find a floor that is significantly out of level (e.g., 15-25mm fall across a bathroom floor that was supposed to be flat). The homeowner assumes the tiler will "just fix it" — in reality, major levelling is expensive ($30-$65/m2), time-consuming, and outside the standard tiling scope. The scope must clearly define what level of substrate imperfection is covered and what is not.

## 6.4 Heated Flooring (Underfloor Heating) Supply and Install

### What It Is

Underfloor heating in Australian residential renovations typically uses electric heating mats or cables embedded beneath floor tiles. The most common systems are thin electric mat systems (e.g., Hotwire, Thermogroup, Comfort Heat, Speedheat) that are laid on top of the substrate (or screed) and then tiled over. Less commonly, hydronic (water-based) systems are used, typically set in a screed layer.

### Why Heated Flooring Is Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Electrical trade item:** The heating mat, thermostat, and electrical connections are electrical work. A licensed electrician must:
   - Test the heating mat resistance before installation
   - Connect the mat to the thermostat and power supply
   - Test the mat again after tiling (continuity check)
   - Commission the system and certify the electrical work
   The tiler has NO role in any of these electrical tasks.

2. **Supply responsibility:** The heating mat system is typically either owner-supplied or electrician-supplied. It is not a tiling material. The cost ranges from $80-$200/m2 for the heating system itself (mat + thermostat + controller), which is a significant cost that belongs in the electrical scope, not the tiling scope.

3. **Coordination required but cost excluded:** The tiler DOES tile over the heating mat. The tiler's responsibility is:
   - Tile carefully over the mat without damaging cables
   - Use flexible adhesive suitable for heated substrates (e.g., Ardex X77, Davco Ultraflex)
   - Apply adhesive at the correct thickness to fully encapsulate the heating element
   - Monitor the heating mat continuity during tiling (a monitor/alarm is typically attached during tiling)

   The tiler's additional labour for tiling over a heated floor is typically small ($5-$15/m2 premium for care and flexible adhesive) and may or may not be included in the base tiling rate.

4. **Curing and commissioning sequence:** After tiling, the adhesive and grout must cure for at least 14 days before the underfloor heating is switched on. The electrician commissions the system. The tiler has no role post-tiling.

### Scope Language

**Excluded:** "Supply and installation of underfloor heating system (heating mat, thermostat, electrical connection) is excluded from this tiling scope and is the responsibility of a licensed electrician."

**Included (if applicable):** "Tiling over owner/electrician-supplied underfloor heating mat is included. Flexible adhesive suitable for heated substrates will be used. Tiler to exercise care to avoid damage to heating cables during installation. Continuity monitor to be provided by electrician and attached during tiling."

**Optional surcharge:** "An additional allowance of $[X]/m2 is included for tiling over underfloor heating to account for flexible adhesive and careful installation."

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners often assume the "tiler will sort out the floor heating" since it goes under tiles. In reality, the heating system is an electrical item requiring a licensed electrician for supply, installation, testing, and commissioning. The tiler's only role is tiling over it carefully. The scope must separate these responsibilities clearly.

## 6.5 Tile Sealing

### What It Is

Tile sealing involves applying a penetrating or topical sealer to tiles and/or grout to protect against staining, moisture absorption, and wear. The requirement for sealing depends entirely on the tile type:

| Tile Type | Sealing Required? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Glazed ceramic** | No | Glaze is already impervious |
| **Glazed porcelain** | No | Glaze is already impervious |
| **Unglazed/full-body porcelain** | Sometimes — varies by product | Some have micro-porosity that can absorb stains |
| **Natural stone — marble** | Yes — essential | Highly porous; stains easily without sealer |
| **Natural stone — travertine** | Yes — essential | Very porous; requires filling and sealing |
| **Natural stone — limestone** | Yes — essential | Porous and acid-sensitive |
| **Natural stone — granite** | Sometimes | Some granites are very dense; others need sealing |
| **Natural stone — slate** | Yes — recommended | Enhances colour and protects against staining |
| **Terrazzo** | Yes — recommended | Requires sealing to maintain appearance |
| **Encaustic/cement tiles** | Yes — essential (pre-seal AND post-seal) | Extremely porous; must be pre-sealed before grouting |

### Why Tile Sealing Is Sometimes Excluded

1. **Not always required:** For the most common tile types used in Australian renovations (glazed porcelain, glazed ceramic), sealing is not needed. Including sealing as a default scope item would be misleading for these tile types.

2. **Owner responsibility for natural stone:** When the owner selects natural stone, the sealing requirement is driven by their tile selection. The cost of sealing products (premium impregnating sealers like DryTreat Stain-Proof, Aqua Mix Penetrating Sealer) can be $15-$40/m2 for product alone, plus application labour. This is a significant cost tied to the owner's tile choice.

3. **Multi-step process for some stones:** Some natural stones (particularly marble and travertine) require:
   - **Pre-seal** before grouting (to prevent grout staining the stone face)
   - **Grout, clean, and dry**
   - **Post-seal** after grouting (full impregnating sealer)
   This is substantially more labour than standard tiling and is typically quoted as an additional line item.

4. **Ongoing maintenance responsibility:** Sealers degrade over time. Penetrating sealers for natural stone typically last 3-15 years depending on the product (premium impregnating sealers like DryTreat Stain-Proof claim 15-20 years). The initial seal is the tiler's scope; ongoing re-sealing is homeowner maintenance.

### Scope Language

| Scenario | Scope Language |
|---|---|
| **Glazed tiles — no sealing needed** | "Tile sealing is not required for the specified glazed porcelain/ceramic tiles. No sealing is included in this scope." |
| **Natural stone — sealing excluded** | "Sealing of natural stone tiles is excluded from this scope. Owner to arrange sealing by a specialist stone care professional or to confirm in writing if sealing is to be added to this scope (additional cost applies)." |
| **Natural stone — sealing included** | "Supply and apply one coat of impregnating sealer (e.g., [product name]) to all natural stone tiles after grouting. Pre-sealing of stone tiles before grouting is included where required by the stone supplier's recommendations. Sealer supply cost: $[X]. Application labour included. Note: Ongoing re-sealing is the owner's maintenance responsibility." |
| **Grout sealing only** | "Apply penetrating grout sealer to all grout lines after curing (minimum 72 hours). Grout sealer supply and application included. Note: Grout sealer should be re-applied every [1-3] years as part of normal maintenance." |

### Key Dispute Point

The most common sealing dispute occurs with natural stone. Homeowners select beautiful marble or travertine tiles, not realising they require sealing before AND after grouting, plus ongoing maintenance sealing. When stains appear within weeks of installation because sealing was not included (or not specified), the homeowner blames the tiler. The scope must clearly state whether sealing is included and, if not, that the owner is responsible for arranging it.

## 6.6 Removing Existing Tiles

### What It Is

Tile removal (also called "tile strip" or "tile demolition") is the process of removing existing wall and/or floor tiles, along with the adhesive bed beneath them, to prepare the surface for new tiling. In renovation contexts, this is almost always necessary — you rarely tile directly over old tiles (though it is sometimes done for floors if conditions allow).

### Why Tile Removal Is Frequently Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Often a demolition trade item:** In a managed renovation, tile removal is typically handled by the demolition contractor as part of the overall strip-out, not by the tiler. The demolition contractor removes all existing finishes (tiles, fixtures, vanities, shower screens, etc.) and leaves the space ready for trades.

2. **Highly variable cost:** The cost of tile removal varies enormously based on:

| Factor | Impact on Cost |
|---|---|
| **How tiles were fixed** | Thin-bed adhesive on cement render = relatively easy. Thick-bed mortar on sand/cement screed = very difficult. |
| **Substrate type** | Tiles on plasterboard = plasterboard is usually destroyed during removal and must be replaced. Tiles on cement render = render may come off with tiles. Tiles on concrete slab = adhesive residue often needs grinding. |
| **Area size** | Larger areas can be done more efficiently with mechanical tools. Small, confined areas (shower recesses) are slower and more expensive per m2. |
| **Wall vs floor** | Wall tile removal is slower and more labour-intensive than floor tile removal (gravity works against you; confined spaces). |
| **Tile type** | Mosaic tiles with extensive grout lines are slow to remove. Large format tiles may come off in sheets. Natural stone can be extremely heavy. |
| **Building age** | Pre-1990 homes have a HIGH risk of asbestos in tile adhesive (see Section 6.12). This can halt work entirely until asbestos testing is done. |
| **Disposal** | Tile waste is heavy. Disposal costs for a standard bathroom can be $200-$500 for skip bin hire. Asbestos-contaminated tile waste requires licensed disposal at significantly higher cost. |

3. **Typical tile removal costs (2025-2026 AUD):**

| Tile Removal Scenario | Cost Range (per m2) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Floor tiles — thin-bed on concrete slab | $25-$45/m2 | Includes adhesive grinding |
| Floor tiles — thick-bed on screed | $35-$60/m2 | Screed may also need removal |
| Wall tiles — thin-bed on cement render | $30-$50/m2 | Render often removed with tiles |
| Wall tiles — on plasterboard | $25-$40/m2 | Plasterboard replacement separate (see Making Good) |
| Mosaic tiles (any substrate) | $40-$70/m2 | Slow, labour-intensive |
| Asbestos adhesive tiles | $60-$150/m2 | Licensed removalist required |

4. **Risk of hidden damage:** Tile removal frequently reveals problems that were hidden behind or beneath the old tiles: water damage, mould, rotten framing, failed waterproofing, termite damage, or asbestos. The tiler cannot price these risks in advance.

### Scope Language

| Scenario | Scope Language |
|---|---|
| **Tile removal excluded (most common)** | "Removal of existing tiles is excluded from this tiling scope. All existing tiles, adhesive residue, and debris to be removed by others (demolition contractor) prior to tiler's commencement. Substrate to be left clean, sound, and ready to receive new tiles." |
| **Tile removal included** | "Remove existing [wall/floor] tiles in [area] including adhesive bed. Dispose of tile waste. Note: If asbestos-containing materials are encountered during removal, work will cease immediately and a licensed asbestos assessor will be engaged at the owner's cost. Substrate making good after removal is [included/excluded] — see Making Good section." |
| **Tile-over-tile** | "New tiles to be fixed directly over existing floor tiles using [suitable adhesive]. Existing tile surface to be cleaned, abraded, and primed. Note: Tile-over-tile increases floor height by approximately [10-15]mm. Check clearances for doors, shower screens, and fixtures." |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners assume tile removal is a simple task ("just chip them off") and are shocked when it costs $1,000-$3,000 for a standard bathroom. They also don't anticipate the risk of asbestos in pre-1990 homes, which can add $2,000-$5,000+ to removal costs if detected. The scope must clearly state whether tile removal is included and, if included, what happens if asbestos is found.

## 6.7 Floor Levelling Compound

### What It Is

Floor levelling compound (also called self-levelling compound, SLC, or floor screed) is a cementitious product poured or pumped onto a floor substrate to create a flat, level surface suitable for tiling. Common products used in Australia include Ardex K301, Mapei Ultraplan, Sika Level Pro, and Bostik Ultraset Leveller.

### Why Floor Levelling Is Sometimes Excluded

1. **Minor vs major levelling distinction:** There is a critical threshold that separates "normal" substrate preparation (included in tiling) from "major levelling" (excluded or additional):

| Levelling Depth | Classification | Cost Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **0-3mm** | Within normal adhesive bed. No special action needed. | Included in tiling scope |
| **3-5mm** | Minor undulation. Can often be addressed with adhesive build-up or skim coat of levelling compound. | Usually included in tiling scope |
| **5-10mm** | Moderate levelling required. Self-levelling compound needed over part or all of the floor. | Grey area — sometimes included, sometimes additional. Must be specified in scope. |
| **10-25mm** | Major levelling required. Significant volume of levelling compound. | Almost always excluded from tiling scope or quoted as a separate line item. |
| **25mm+** | Severe levelling or screeding required. May need to be done in multiple pours. Possibly a screed contractor's work. | Always excluded from tiling scope. Separate trade. |

2. **Material cost is significant:** Self-levelling compound is expensive — typically $1.50-$3.00 per mm per m2 for product alone. A 15m2 bathroom floor requiring 15mm of levelling compound could cost $350-$700 in product alone, plus $300-$500 in labour. This is too significant to bury in a tiling quote without being explicit.

3. **Cannot be assessed until old tiles are removed:** In most renovations, the extent of floor levelling required cannot be determined until the existing tiles (and often the old screed) have been removed. This means the levelling cost is often a variable that must be priced after demolition.

4. **Curing time extends the program:** Self-levelling compound typically requires 24-48 hours to cure before tiling can commence (varies by product and depth). This adds to the project timeline and must be coordinated.

### Typical Floor Levelling Costs (2025-2026 AUD)

| Scenario | Cost Range (per m2) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Self-levelling compound up to 10mm | $30-$50/m2 | Including product, primers, and labour |
| Self-levelling compound 10-25mm | $45-$65/m2 | May require two pours; higher material cost |
| Self-levelling compound 25mm+ | $60-$100+/m2 | Multiple pours; may need aggregate filler; extended curing |
| Traditional sand/cement screed | $30-$50/m2 | Thicker applications; longer curing (7-28 days) |

### Scope Language

| Scenario | Scope Language |
|---|---|
| **Minor levelling included** | "Standard floor preparation including minor levelling (up to 5mm) with levelling compound or adhesive build-up is included in this scope." |
| **Levelling excluded** | "Floor levelling compound is excluded from this scope. If floor levelling beyond normal adhesive bed adjustment (>5mm) is required, this will be quoted separately after substrate assessment. Owner will be notified and a separate quote provided before work proceeds." |
| **Levelling as provisional sum** | "A provisional allowance of $[X] is included for floor levelling compound (up to [X]mm depth over [X]m2). If actual levelling requirements differ, the cost will be adjusted accordingly." |

### Key Dispute Point

The most common levelling dispute arises when old tiles are removed and the floor beneath is significantly out of level (common in older Australian homes, especially those built on stumps where timber floors have moved over time). The homeowner expects the tiler to "just level it out" — but major levelling can cost $500-$1,500 for a bathroom floor. The scope must define the levelling threshold clearly.

## 6.8 Feature Tile Inserts, Borders, and Complex Patterns

### What It Is

Feature tiling refers to decorative tile elements that deviate from a simple straight-stack or brick-bond (running bond) layout. This includes:

- **Feature strips/borders:** A contrasting tile band (often mosaic, pencil liner, or chair rail profile) used to break up a wall or floor area
- **Niche inserts:** Decorative tile treatment inside shower niches (often mosaic or feature tile)
- **Herringbone pattern:** Tiles laid at 45-degree angles in a V pattern — popular for splashbacks and feature walls
- **Chevron pattern:** Similar to herringbone but with angled tile ends creating a continuous zigzag
- **Basket weave:** Alternating horizontal and vertical tile pairs
- **Diagonal/diamond lay:** Standard tiles rotated 45 degrees
- **Mixed tile sizes:** Combining different tile sizes in the same area (e.g., large format floor with mosaic border)
- **Waterjet-cut patterns:** Pre-cut decorative tile panels (usually supplied as a complete assembly)

### Why Feature Tiling Is Usually Quoted as an Extra

1. **Significantly more labour:** Complex patterns require more cuts, more precision, more layout planning, and more time. Labour premium estimates:

| Pattern Type | Labour Premium vs Standard Straight Lay | Wastage Premium |
|---|---|---|
| Brick bond (running bond, 1/3 offset) | Baseline (often standard) | Baseline (10%) |
| Herringbone | +30-50% labour | +15-20% wastage |
| Chevron | +40-60% labour | +15-20% wastage |
| Diagonal/diamond lay | +20-30% labour | +15% wastage |
| Basket weave | +25-40% labour | +10-15% wastage |
| Feature border/strip | +$20-$50 per lineal metre | Additional tile supply for border |
| Niche feature tile | +$100-$300 per niche | Additional tile supply for niche |
| Mixed tile sizes in same area | +30-50% labour | +15% wastage for each size |

2. **More cutting waste:** Herringbone, chevron, and diagonal layouts generate significantly more off-cuts than straight lay. Every tile at the perimeter of a herringbone area must be cut at an angle, and many off-cuts are unusable for other positions.

3. **Layout precision:** Feature patterns must be carefully set out to ensure visual alignment. Herringbone, for example, must be centred on the focal point of the room and must be perfectly straight — any deviation is immediately visible. This setup time is not required for standard straight lay.

4. **Different adhesive/grouting techniques:** Some feature patterns (especially mosaics in niches) require different adhesive application methods (back-buttering individual tiles rather than notch-trowelling the substrate).

### Scope Language

| Scenario | Scope Language |
|---|---|
| **Standard lay only** | "All tiling in straight stack/brick bond (running bond) pattern. Feature tiles, decorative borders, inserts, herringbone, chevron, diagonal, or other complex patterns are excluded unless specifically listed below." |
| **Feature pattern included** | "Tile [area] in [herringbone/chevron/diagonal] pattern as per design drawings. Additional labour allowance for complex pattern included. Tile wastage allowance increased to [15-20]% to account for pattern cutting." |
| **Niche feature** | "Supply and fix [mosaic/feature tile] to [number] x shower niche(s) [dimensions]. Feature tile supply by [owner/tiler]." |
| **Feature border** | "Install [tile type] feature border at [location and height], approximately [X] lineal metres. Border tile supply by [owner/tiler]. Additional labour for border installation included." |

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners see a beautiful herringbone splashback on Pinterest and assume it costs the same as a straight-laid splashback. The labour premium for herringbone can add $500-$1,500 to a kitchen splashback. The scope must clearly list the lay pattern for each tiled area and flag any premium patterns.

## 6.9 Cut-Outs for Floor Wastes, Fixtures, and Penetrations

### What It Is

Cut-outs are the holes, notches, and shaped cuts that a tiler makes in tiles to accommodate floor wastes (drains), pipe penetrations, power point boxes, tap fittings, towel rail brackets, toilet cistern connections, vanity plumbing, and other fixtures that penetrate through or sit against tiled surfaces.

### What Is Standard (Included)

Standard cut-outs that are typically included in a tiling quote:

- **Floor waste grate:** Circular or square cut-out in floor tile(s) to accommodate the floor waste — typically 1-2 per bathroom
- **Shower waste:** Cut-out for shower drain
- **Standard pipe penetrations:** Neat round holes for hot/cold water supply pipes (basin, shower, toilet cistern) — diamond core drill holes
- **Power point and switch plates:** Rectangular cut-outs for electrical plate openings — typically scored and snapped or cut with angle grinder
- **Toilet flange:** Cut-out around toilet waste pipe
- **Standard fixture brackets:** Small penetrations for towel rails, toilet roll holders, shower screen brackets

### What Is Additional (May Be Excluded)

| Cut-Out Type | Why It May Be Additional | Typical Surcharge |
|---|---|---|
| **Large format tile around multiple penetrations** | Cutting multiple precise holes in a single large tile (e.g., 1200x600 tile around 4 pipes) requires diamond drilling and extreme care — one mistake destroys an expensive tile | $50-$150 per complex tile |
| **Linear drain/strip drain** | Long, narrow cut-out requiring very precise straight cuts, often in large format tiles. More complex than standard round floor waste | $100-$200 per drain |
| **Custom shower niche cut-outs** | If the tiler is creating niche openings in the tile substrate (rather than tiling a pre-framed niche), this is additional work | $150-$400 per niche |
| **Unusual shapes** | Curved cuts (around curved baths, round columns), L-shaped cuts, or cuts for built-in accessories | Priced individually |
| **Mitred edges** | 45-degree mitre cuts on tile edges for external corners (instead of using trim pieces) — requires precision wet saw work | $15-$40 per lineal metre |

### Scope Language

**Standard:** "Standard cut-outs for floor wastes, pipe penetrations, power points, and fixture brackets are included in this scope."

**Additional:** "Complex cut-outs including but not limited to: multiple penetrations in a single large format tile, linear drain cut-outs, mitred edge profiles, and curved cuts will be quoted individually if required."

### Key Dispute Point

The most common cut-out dispute involves mitred edges. Homeowners see mitred external corners on Instagram and assume this is standard. In reality, mitred edges require a skilled tiler with a precision wet saw, take significantly longer than using aluminium trim, and carry a risk of chipping (especially on porcelain). The premium for mitred edges should be specified.

## 6.10 Tile Supply Wastage

### What It Is

Tile wastage is the percentage of additional tiles (beyond the measured tiled area) that must be purchased to account for: cutting at edges and corners, breakage during cutting, breakage during handling/transport, defective tiles from the batch (manufacturing defects), tiles damaged during installation, and spare tiles for future repairs.

### Recommended Wastage Allowances

| Layout/Condition | Recommended Wastage % | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard straight lay — square/rectangular room** | 10% | Industry standard minimum. Accounts for edge cuts and minor breakage. |
| **Brick bond (running bond, 1/3 offset)** | 10% | Similar to straight lay; offset creates slightly more edge cuts. |
| **Diagonal/diamond lay** | 15% | Every perimeter tile is cut at 45 degrees, creating more waste. |
| **Herringbone** | 15-20% | Angled cuts at all perimeters; many off-cuts are unusable for other positions. |
| **Chevron** | 15-20% | Similar to herringbone; angled tile ends create additional waste. |
| **Complex room shape (many corners, alcoves, angles)** | 15% | More cuts at non-standard angles. |
| **Large format tiles (600x600+) in small rooms** | 15% | Large tiles in small spaces = more cuts relative to area; each wasted cut is a larger area loss. |
| **Mosaic tiles (sheet-mounted)** | 10% | Sheets are easier to cut; less individual tile waste. |
| **Natural stone** | 15% | Higher risk of breakage during cutting; natural variation may mean more tiles discarded for aesthetic reasons. |
| **Handmade/artisan tiles** | 15-20% | Higher manufacturing variation; more tiles discarded for quality reasons. |

### Who Pays for Wastage?

| Approach | How It Works | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner supplies tiles including wastage** | Owner purchases measured area + wastage %. The tiler advises on the percentage. Any leftover tiles belong to the owner (recommended: keep 2-3 spare tiles for future repairs). | Most common. Owner buys based on tiler's m2 measurement + recommended wastage %. |
| **Tiler supplies tiles — wastage built into quote** | Tiler calculates total quantity including wastage and includes in the supply cost. | When tiler is supplying tiles. Wastage cost is embedded in the tile supply line. |
| **Owner supplies — tiler responsible for excessive breakage** | Owner supplies tiles + standard wastage. If the tiler breaks tiles excessively beyond normal wastage, the tiler replaces at their cost. | Fair standard. Requires agreement on what "excessive" means. |

### Scope Language

**Standard:** "Owner to supply tiles for all areas including a wastage allowance of [10/15/20]% above measured area. Tiler to confirm required tile quantities and wastage percentage prior to owner placing tile order. Owner is advised to retain [2-5] spare tiles per area for future repairs."

**If tiler supplies:** "Tile supply includes [10/15/20]% wastage allowance. Unused tiles will be returned to supplier where possible; any credit will be passed to the owner."

### Key Dispute Point

The number one wastage dispute: the homeowner buys exactly the measured area (e.g., 15m2 of tiles for a 15m2 floor) with no wastage allowance, then is furious when the tiler runs out of tiles. If the tile batch has sold out at the retailer, the homeowner may need to wait weeks for a restock (or accept a different batch with potential colour variation). The AI scope generator must ALWAYS advise on wastage and never let the homeowner order the bare minimum.

## 6.11 Making Good

### What It Is

"Making good" refers to repairing or restoring surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, framing) that are damaged or left in poor condition as a result of tile removal or renovation work. In the context of a tiling scope, making good typically means repairing:

- **Plasterboard walls** damaged during tile removal (the most common scenario — old tiles pull the paper face off plasterboard, or entire sections of plasterboard come away with the tiles)
- **Cement render** that has debonded or been removed with old tiles
- **Timber framing** exposed after tile and sheeting removal (rotten studs, termite damage)
- **Concrete slab** surface that is uneven or damaged after screed removal
- **Villaboard/fibre cement** that has deteriorated behind old tiles (especially in wet areas)

### Why Making Good Is Almost Always Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Unknown extent:** The extent of making good cannot be determined until old tiles are removed. A tiler cannot price repair work that they cannot see.

2. **Different trade skills:** Repairing plasterboard is a plastering/carpentry skill. Repairing timber framing is a carpentry skill. Repairing render is a rendering skill. While many experienced tilers CAN do minor repairs, extensive making good is outside the tiling trade.

3. **Potentially major cost:** Making good after tile removal in a bathroom can cost:

| Making Good Item | Typical Cost | Trade Responsible |
|---|---|---|
| Replace plasterboard to shower walls (standard bathroom) | $400-$1,200 | Carpenter/plasterer |
| Replace plasterboard to all bathroom walls | $800-$2,500 | Carpenter/plasterer |
| Replace rotten timber framing (per stud/nogging) | $100-$300 per member | Carpenter |
| Re-render walls (cement render) | $40-$80/m2 | Renderer |
| Repair concrete slab surface | $30-$60/m2 | Concreter/tiler |
| Replace fibre cement sheeting (villaboard) | $50-$90/m2 installed | Carpenter |

4. **Sequential dependency:** Making good must be completed BEFORE the tiler can proceed. If the tiler has to wait for a plasterer/carpenter/renderer, this creates program delays and potentially a return visit for the tiler (additional mobilisation cost).

### Scope Language

**Excluded (standard):** "Making good to walls, floors, and framing after tile removal is excluded from this tiling scope. All substrates to be repaired, made sound, and ready to receive new tiles before tiling commences. This includes but is not limited to: plasterboard replacement, timber framing repairs, re-rendering, and slab repair."

**Minor making good included:** "Minor substrate making good is included to the extent of: filling small holes (up to 50mm diameter) in cement render with suitable repair mortar, and applying skim coat of tile adhesive to minor surface imperfections. Plasterboard replacement, framing repairs, and re-rendering are excluded."

### Key Dispute Point

The most common making good dispute in Australian bathroom renovations: tiles are removed from shower walls, revealing that the plasterboard behind is completely destroyed (soaked, mouldy, crumbling). The homeowner expects the tiler to "just fix it" — but replacing plasterboard in a shower recess, including framing repairs, new villaboard sheeting, and waterproofing of the new substrate, can cost $1,500-$3,500 and involves at least two other trades (carpenter and waterproofer). This must be flagged as an exclusion AND as a common discovery during renovation.

## 6.12 Asbestos

### What It Is

Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) are commonly found in Australian homes built before 1990 (and some built up to 2003 when asbestos was finally banned nationally). In the context of tiling, asbestos is most commonly encountered in:

- **Tile adhesive (mastic):** Black bitumen-based adhesives used to fix vinyl and ceramic tiles frequently contained chrysotile (white) asbestos
- **Vinyl floor tiles:** Vinyl/asbestos composite floor tiles (VAT) were extremely common in Australian homes from the 1950s-1980s
- **Fibre cement sheeting:** Walls lined with "fibro" (asbestos cement sheeting, e.g., old James Hardie "Hardiflex" or "Super Six") behind tiles
- **Cement render with asbestos additives:** Some render mixes used in the 1960s-1980s contained asbestos fibres

### Why Asbestos Is ALWAYS Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Legal requirement for licensed removal:** In all Australian states and territories:
   - Removing more than 10m2 of non-friable asbestos (e.g., intact vinyl tiles, fibre cement sheeting) requires a licensed asbestos removalist (Class B licence)
   - Removing ANY amount of friable asbestos (e.g., crumbling adhesive, deteriorated fibro) requires a Class A licensed asbestos removalist
   - The ACT requires a licensed removalist for ALL asbestos removal regardless of area
   A tiler is NOT licensed to remove asbestos. Doing so is illegal and carries severe penalties.

2. **Testing requirement:** If asbestos is suspected (any home built before 1990, or before 2003 for fibro products), material samples should be tested by a NATA-accredited laboratory before disturbance. Testing costs $30-$80 per sample, with results typically available in 2-5 business days.

3. **Cost impact is severe:** If asbestos is found:

| Scenario | Cost Impact | Timeline Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Asbestos in tile adhesive (floor) — non-friable | $60-$150/m2 for removal + disposal | 2-5 days for removal; 1-3 days for clearance certificate |
| Asbestos vinyl floor tiles — non-friable | $50-$120/m2 for removal + disposal | 1-3 days for removal |
| Asbestos in fibro wall sheeting — non-friable | $50-$100/m2 for removal + disposal | 2-5 days for removal |
| Friable asbestos (crumbling adhesive/render) | $100-$250+/m2 (Class A removal) | 3-7+ days; may require air monitoring |
| Asbestos disposal (licenced tip) | $250-$500 per tonne (on top of removal cost) | Included in removal timeline |
| Asbestos clearance certificate | $200-$500 | Required before other trades can re-enter |

4. **Work must stop immediately:** If suspected asbestos is encountered during tile removal, ALL work must cease. The area must be sealed, an asbestos assessor called, samples taken, and a licensed removalist engaged if asbestos is confirmed. This is a legal obligation, not a choice.

### Scope Language

**Standard exclusion (MUST be included in every tiling scope for pre-1990 homes):**

"Asbestos identification, testing, removal, and disposal are excluded from this tiling scope. This property was built in [year]. Homes built before 1990 (and some built before 2003) may contain asbestos-containing materials in tile adhesive, vinyl floor tiles, wall sheeting, or render. If suspected asbestos-containing materials are encountered during the works, the tiler will immediately cease work in the affected area and notify the owner. The owner is responsible for engaging a licensed asbestos assessor and, if required, a licensed asbestos removalist. Work will not recommence in the affected area until an asbestos clearance certificate has been issued. Any delays, additional costs, or remobilisation charges arising from asbestos discovery are the owner's responsibility."

**For post-2003 homes:** "This property was built after 2003. Asbestos-containing materials are not expected. However, if suspected asbestos is encountered during the works, the tiler will cease work and notify the owner."

### Key Dispute Point

Homeowners in pre-1990 homes are often completely unaware that their bathroom tiles may be sitting on asbestos adhesive. When the tiler (or demolition contractor) discovers asbestos and work stops, the homeowner is hit with an unexpected $2,000-$8,000 bill for removal and disposal, plus project delays. The tiling scope must flag asbestos risk prominently for all pre-1990 properties. The AI scope generator should prompt for building age and include appropriate asbestos warnings.

## 6.13 Structural Work

### What It Is

Structural work in the context of tiling refers to any modifications or reinforcement required to the building structure to safely support tiled surfaces. This includes:

- **Floor structure reinforcement** for heavy tile types (natural stone, large format porcelain, terrazzo) — especially on upper floors with timber framing
- **Wall framing modifications** to create shower niches, hob walls, bath surrounds, or to straighten significantly out-of-plumb walls
- **Beam/joist reinforcement** where additional dead load from tiles exceeds the original structural design
- **Slab repairs** where the concrete slab is cracked, undermined, or settling

### Why Structural Work Is Always Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Not a tiling trade skill:** Structural work requires a licensed builder (at minimum) and often a structural engineer's design. A tiler is not qualified, licensed, or insured to perform structural modifications.

2. **Weight considerations are significant:** The Australian tiling industry commonly cites a maximum background loading capacity of 32 kg/m2 for standard substrates. Tile weights vary significantly:

| Tile Type | Approximate Weight (installed, including adhesive bed) |
|---|---|
| Ceramic wall tile (8mm thick) | 15-20 kg/m2 |
| Porcelain floor tile (10mm thick) | 22-28 kg/m2 |
| Large format porcelain (12mm thick) | 28-35 kg/m2 |
| Natural stone — marble (20mm thick) | 50-60 kg/m2 |
| Natural stone — granite (20mm thick) | 55-65 kg/m2 |
| Natural stone — slate (15mm thick) | 40-50 kg/m2 |
| Terrazzo (20mm thick) | 45-55 kg/m2 |

Heavy tile selections on upper-floor timber-framed bathrooms may require structural assessment. A structural engineer's inspection is recommended for natural stone on timber-framed upper floors.

3. **Engineer's certificate may be required:** For heavy tile installations on timber floors, council or building certifier may require a structural engineer's certificate confirming the floor can support the load. This is especially true for:
   - Natural stone on upper-floor bathrooms in timber-framed homes
   - Large format porcelain on older (undersized) timber floor joists
   - Any tile installation on a balcony or suspended slab where load limits are critical

### Scope Language

**Standard exclusion:** "Any structural modifications to walls, floors, framing, or slabs required to support tiled surfaces are excluded from this tiling scope. This includes but is not limited to: floor joist reinforcement, wall framing modifications, slab repairs, construction of hob walls, and creation of shower niches in framing. If the tiler identifies potential structural concerns during the works, the owner will be notified and advised to engage a licensed builder and/or structural engineer."

**For heavy tiles:** "The specified [natural stone/large format] tiles are heavier than standard ceramic or porcelain tiles. The owner is advised to confirm with a structural engineer that the [floor/wall] substrate is suitable to support the weight of the specified tiles (approximately [X] kg/m2 installed). Any structural reinforcement required is excluded from this tiling scope."

### Key Dispute Point

Upper-floor bathroom renovations where the homeowner selects heavy natural stone tiles. The tiler arrives and assesses that the timber floor is not suitable for the weight — but by this point, the homeowner has purchased $5,000 worth of marble. The scope should flag weight concerns early and recommend structural assessment before tile purchase.

## 6.14 Plumbing and Electrical

### What It Is

Plumbing and electrical work are separate trades that must be completed at specific points in the renovation sequence relative to tiling. The critical sequencing is:

1. **Demolition** (tile removal, strip-out)
2. **Structural/framing** (wall modifications, niche framing)
3. **Plumbing rough-in** (move/install water supply and drainage pipes to their new positions)
4. **Electrical rough-in** (move/install cables, conduits, junction boxes to their new positions)
5. **Waterproofing** (membranes over substrate, including around pipe penetrations)
6. **Tiling** (walls first, then floors)
7. **Plumbing fit-off** (install fixtures — taps, toilet, basin — after tiling)
8. **Electrical fit-off** (install accessories — power points, light fittings, exhaust fans — after tiling)

### Why Plumbing and Electrical Are Always Excluded from a Tiling Scope

1. **Entirely separate licensed trades:** Plumbing requires a plumbing licence. Electrical requires an electrical licence. A tiler cannot perform either.

2. **Sequencing dependency:** Tiling cannot commence until plumbing and electrical rough-in are COMPLETE. Similarly, plumbing and electrical fit-off cannot occur until tiling is COMPLETE. The tiling scope must note these dependencies.

3. **Coordination requirements:** The tiler needs to know the exact position of all pipe penetrations, power points, light switches, exhaust fan openings, and other fixtures BEFORE starting. Changes to fixture positions after tiling has commenced are extremely expensive (tiles must be removed and re-laid).

### Scope Language

**Standard exclusion:** "All plumbing and electrical work is excluded from this tiling scope, including but not limited to: pipe relocation, fixture installation, power point installation, lighting, exhaust fan installation, and underfloor heating electrical connection. All plumbing rough-in (pipe positions finalised) and electrical rough-in (cable positions finalised) must be completed and inspected before tiling commences. Plumbing fit-off (fixtures) and electrical fit-off (accessories) will occur after tiling is complete."

**Coordination note:** "Owner/builder to confirm all pipe and fixture positions with tiler before tile layout is set out. Any changes to fixture positions after tiling has commenced will require tile removal and re-tiling at additional cost."

### Key Dispute Point

The most common cross-trade dispute: plumbing rough-in is not completed before the tiler arrives, causing the tiler to either wait (wasted time, potentially claiming delay costs) or tile around approximate pipe positions (leading to misaligned fixtures later). The scope must clearly state the sequencing prerequisite.

## 6.15 Standard Exclusion Clauses — Template Wording

The following are recommended standard exclusion clauses suitable for inclusion in every tiling scope-of-works document generated by the AI system. These clauses should be adapted based on the specific project but should NEVER be omitted entirely.

### Master Exclusion Clause

```
EXCLUSIONS — The following items are excluded from this tiling scope of works
unless specifically listed in the "Inclusions" section above:

1. TILE SUPPLY: Supply of all wall and floor tiles. Owner to supply all tiles
   to site including [X]% wastage allowance. Tiler to supply adhesive, grout,
   silicone, primers, and sundry installation materials only.

2. WATERPROOFING: All waterproofing works including membrane supply and
   application, bond-breaker tape, puddle flanges, and waterproofing
   certification. Waterproofing to be completed and certified by a licensed
   waterproofer prior to tiling commencement.

3. TILE REMOVAL: Removal of existing tiles, adhesive, and screed. All
   existing tiles and substrate preparation to be completed by others
   (demolition contractor) prior to tiler's commencement.

4. MAKING GOOD: Repairs to walls, floors, framing, plasterboard, render,
   or any substrate damaged during or revealed by tile removal. All
   substrates to be sound, plumb, flat, and ready to receive tiles before
   tiling commences.

5. FLOOR LEVELLING (MAJOR): Floor levelling compound exceeding [5/10]mm
   depth. Minor levelling within normal adhesive bed thickness is included.
   Major levelling will be quoted separately if required after substrate
   assessment.

6. PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL: All plumbing and electrical work including
   rough-in, fit-off, fixture supply and installation. All rough-in to be
   completed before tiling commences.

7. STRUCTURAL WORK: Any structural modifications to walls, floors, framing,
   or slabs. This includes hob walls, shower niche framing, floor
   reinforcement, and slab repairs.

8. UNDERFLOOR HEATING: Supply and installation of underfloor heating
   systems. Tiling over a pre-installed heating mat is [included/excluded —
   specify]. Electrical connection and commissioning by licensed electrician.

9. TILE SEALING: Sealing of tiles [is/is not] included — see Inclusions
   section. [If natural stone: Owner to arrange stone sealing by specialist
   or confirm addition to this scope at additional cost.]

10. ASBESTOS: Identification, testing, removal, and disposal of
    asbestos-containing materials. If suspected asbestos is encountered,
    work will cease immediately and the owner will be notified. Owner to
    engage licensed asbestos assessor and removalist at owner's cost.

11. COUNCIL/AUTHORITY FEES: Building permits, council fees, building
    certifier inspections, and associated costs.

12. SCAFFOLDING AND ACCESS EQUIPMENT: [If applicable] Scaffolding, elevated
    work platforms, or specialist access equipment for areas above 2m height.

13. PAINTING AND DECORATING: Painting of walls, ceilings, or any surfaces
    adjacent to tiled areas.

14. CLEANING: Final construction clean of the property. The tiler will clean
    tiled surfaces upon completion (grout haze removal, silicone cleanup)
    but is not responsible for general site or property cleaning.
```

### Conditional Exclusion Clause (Pre-1990 Homes)

```
ASBESTOS WARNING — IMPORTANT: This property was constructed in [year], prior
to the national asbestos ban (2003). Homes built before 1990 commonly contain
asbestos in tile adhesive, vinyl floor tiles, wall sheeting (fibro), and
render. Before any demolition or tile removal work commences, the owner is
strongly advised to engage a licensed asbestos assessor to test suspect
materials. If asbestos-containing materials are identified, a licensed
asbestos removalist (Class A or Class B as appropriate) must be engaged
before renovation work can proceed. All asbestos-related costs are excluded
from this scope and are the owner's responsibility.
```

### Discovery Clause

```
UNFORESEEN CONDITIONS: If unforeseen conditions are discovered during the
works (including but not limited to: water damage, mould, structural defects,
asbestos, or substrate conditions significantly worse than reasonably
anticipated), the tiler will notify the owner immediately. The tiler will
provide a written assessment of the issue and, where appropriate, a separate
quotation for additional work required. Work in the affected area will not
proceed until the owner has approved the additional work and cost in writing.

ASSUMPTIONS — This scope is based on the following assumptions. If any
assumption is not met, additional costs or program delays may result:

1. All demolition, stripping, and removal of existing finishes will be
   completed by others before the tiler's commencement date.

2. All plumbing rough-in (pipe positions finalised) and electrical rough-in
   (cable and junction box positions finalised) will be completed before
   tiling commences.

3. Waterproofing to all wet areas will be completed, cured, and certified
   before tiling commences.

4. All substrates (walls and floors) will be sound, plumb, flat (within
   AS 3958 tolerances), and free of contaminants. Any making good required
   will be completed before tiling commences.

5. Owner will supply all tiles to site at least [2-3] working days before
   the tiler's scheduled commencement date. Tiles to be from a single batch
   and in sufficient quantity including the agreed wastage allowance.

6. Owner will confirm tile layout, pattern, and grout colour selection
   before tiling commences.

7. Safe access, power, and water will be available on site throughout the

## 6.17 Provisional Sums and Allowances

### What They Are

Provisional sums (PS) and prime cost (PC) sums are mechanisms used in Australian building contracts to handle items that cannot be precisely priced at the time of quoting.

| Term | Definition | Typical Use in Tiling |
|---|---|---|
| **Prime Cost (PC) Sum** | An allowance for the supply cost of a specific product that the owner will select later. Covers the item ONLY, not installation. | Tile supply. The tiler (or builder) includes a dollar-per-m2 allowance for tiles. If the owner selects tiles above or below the PC, the contract price adjusts. |
| **Provisional Sum (PS)** | An allowance for work (labour + materials) that cannot be precisely priced at the time of quoting, usually because the extent of work is unknown. | Floor levelling, substrate repair, tile removal. The work is known to be needed but the extent cannot be determined until work commences. |

### How PC/PS Sums Work in Tiling Quotes

**Prime Cost for Tiles:**

```
Example:
  Floor tiling — 15m2 bathroom floor
  Labour (supply and fix): $85/m2 = $1,275
  Tile supply (PC sum): $80/m2 = $1,200
  Total (inclusive of PC): $2,475

  If owner selects tiles at $120/m2:
  PC adjustment: ($120 - $80) x 15m2 = +$600
  Adjusted total: $3,075

  If owner selects tiles at $50/m2:
  PC adjustment: ($50 - $80) x 15m2 = -$450
  Adjusted total: $2,025
```

**Key legal requirement:** Under Australian consumer law and state-specific home building legislation:
- The PC/PS amount must be a "reasonable estimate" of the likely cost — not a lowball figure designed to make the quote look cheap
- Any adjustment (up or down) must be documented and agreed in writing
- The builder/contractor must pass on the actual cost plus their stated margin — they cannot inflate the actual cost

**Provisional Sum for Floor Levelling:**

```
Example:
  Provisional sum for floor levelling compound: $500
  (Based on estimated 10mm levelling over 15m2)

  Actual levelling required: 20mm over 15m2
  Actual cost: $850
  PS adjustment: +$350
  Owner to approve adjustment before work proceeds.
```

### Scope Language for PC/PS Sums

**PC Sum for tiles:** "A prime cost allowance of $[X]/m2 has been included for tile supply. This is a reasonable estimate based on mid-range [porcelain/ceramic] tiles. The final tile supply cost will be adjusted based on the owner's selection. If the actual tile cost exceeds the PC allowance, the difference will be added to the contract price. If the actual cost is below the PC allowance, a credit will be applied."

**PS for levelling:** "A provisional sum of $[X] has been included for floor levelling compound, based on an estimated levelling depth of [X]mm over [X]m2. The actual cost will be confirmed after substrate assessment following tile removal. If the actual cost differs from the provisional sum, the contract price will be adjusted accordingly. The owner will be notified and approval sought before the work proceeds."

### Key Dispute Point

PC sums set too low are the single most common source of builder-homeowner disputes in Australia. If a builder includes a PC of $40/m2 for tiles (budget range), and the homeowner selects tiles at $120/m2 (mid-premium range), the contract price jumps by $80/m2 across the entire project — which for a bathroom (30-50m2 of tiling) can be a $2,400-$4,000 blowout. The AI scope generator should use realistic mid-range PC sums and clearly explain the adjustment mechanism.

## 6.18 Grout Sealing

### What It Is

Grout sealing is the application of a penetrating sealer to grout lines after the grout has fully cured (minimum 72 hours, ideally 7 days for cement-based grouts). This is a separate consideration from tile sealing (Section 6.5). Grout sealing protects grout from:
- Staining (especially in kitchens and bathrooms)
- Moisture absorption
- Mould and mildew growth
- Discolouration over time

### Types of Grout and Sealing Requirements

| Grout Type | Sealing Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Cement-based grout (standard)** | Yes — recommended | Porous by nature; absorbs stains without sealing |
| **Cement-based grout (polymer-modified)** | Yes — recommended (but more resistant than standard) | Better stain resistance but still benefits from sealing |
| **Epoxy grout** | No | Non-porous; does not absorb stains or moisture. More expensive. |
| **Polyurethane grout** | No | Non-porous; premium product |

### Why Grout Sealing Is Sometimes Excluded

1. **Not always the tiler's scope:** Some tilers include grout sealing as a standard final step. Others consider it a maintenance item or a separate service. There is no universal standard.

2. **Timing matters:** Grout sealer should not be applied until the grout is fully cured. For cement-based grouts, this is typically 72 hours minimum, but 7 days is ideal. If the tiler completes tiling and moves to the next job, they may not return for grout sealing.

3. **Cost is relatively minor:** Grout sealer product costs $5-$15/m2 and application labour is fast ($10-$20/m2). Total cost for a bathroom is typically $100-$300. While modest, it should still be specified.

4. **Epoxy grout eliminates the need:** If the homeowner selects epoxy grout (more common in wet areas), sealing is not required. Epoxy grout is more expensive to install ($15-$30/m2 premium over cement-based) but provides superior water and stain resistance.

### Scope Language

**Grout sealing included:** "Apply penetrating grout sealer to all grout lines after grout has cured (minimum 72 hours). Grout sealer supply and application included. Note: Ongoing re-application of grout sealer is the owner's maintenance responsibility (recommended every 1-3 years for standard cement-based grout)."

**Grout sealing excluded:** "Grout sealing is excluded from this scope. Owner to arrange grout sealing after grout has fully cured (minimum 7 days recommended). Grout sealer product recommendations: [list suitable products]."

**Epoxy grout option:** "Epoxy grout has been specified for [wet area/all areas]. Epoxy grout does not require sealing. Additional cost for epoxy grout over standard cement-based grout is included in this scope."
