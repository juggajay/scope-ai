## 7.1 Labour Rates by Tile Size -- Standard Lay

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources across Australian cost guides)

Labour rates below are for **straight lay (grid) pattern on prepared substrate**, labour only, excluding tile supply.

### Standard Size Tiles (300x300, 300x600, 600x600)

| Application | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Floor tiling** | $45/m2 | $60/m2 | $80/m2 | Most common residential tile sizes; fast to lay |
| **Wall tiling** | $40/m2 | $55/m2 | $70/m2 | Wall tiling slightly less per m2 than floor on average |

### Large Format Tiles (600x1200, 800x800, 900x900, 1200x1200+)

| Application | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Floor tiling** | $60/m2 | $75/m2 | $95/m2 | Requires 2 people; lippage risk; specialist adhesive |
| **Wall tiling** | $65/m2 | $80/m2 | $100/m2 | Gravity challenge; mechanical support during setting |

### Small Format / Mosaic Tiles (sheet-mounted mosaics, penny round, hexagonal, subway < 200mm)

| Application | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Floor tiling** | $65/m2 | $85/m2 | $120/m2 | More grout lines; more cutting around edges; slower |
| **Wall tiling** | $60/m2 | $80/m2 | $110/m2 | Sheet-mounted mosaics are faster than individual pieces |
| **Feature niche / accent strip** | $70/m2 | $95/m2 | $150/m2 | Very small areas with high precision; often quoted as fixed price per niche ($150-$250 each) |

**Key notes:**
- Standard size tiles (300x600, 600x600) are the most cost-effective to install and the most commonly quoted
- Large format tiles (600x1200+) typically require a minimum team of two tilers, which increases labour cost by 15-25% over standard sizes
- Very large slabs (1200x2400+) are specialist work and may be quoted at $100-$150+/m2 for labour alone
- Mosaic tiles on mesh sheets are faster than individual mosaics but still 30-50% more labour than standard tiles
- These rates assume a level, primed substrate ready for tiling. Substrate preparation is additional

## 7.2 Labour Rates by Pattern Complexity

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent premium ranges across sources)

Pattern premiums are **additional labour cost** above the standard straight-lay rates in Section 7.1. Some tilers quote pattern work as a separate per-m2 rate rather than as a premium.

### Herringbone / Chevron Pattern

| Application | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Floor -- herringbone** | $70/m2 | $90/m2 | $120/m2 | All-in labour rate; 25-40% premium over straight lay |
| **Wall -- herringbone** | $65/m2 | $85/m2 | $110/m2 | Common for splashbacks and feature walls |
| **Premium add over straight lay** | +$15/m2 | +$25/m2 | +$40/m2 | If quoting as a surcharge |

### Diagonal / Diamond Pattern

| Application | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Floor -- diagonal** | $60/m2 | $75/m2 | $95/m2 | All-in labour rate; 15-25% premium over straight lay |
| **Wall -- diagonal** | $55/m2 | $70/m2 | $90/m2 | Less common on walls but sometimes specified |
| **Premium add over straight lay** | +$10/m2 | +$15/m2 | +$25/m2 | If quoting as a surcharge |

### Other Pattern Premiums (Reference)

| Pattern | Typical Premium Over Straight Lay | Notes |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Brick bond / offset (1/3 or 1/2)** | +$5-$10/m2 | Very common; minimal extra cutting |
| **Basketweave** | +$15-$30/m2 | Moderate complexity |
| **Versailles / French pattern** | +$20-$40/m2 | Multiple tile sizes; layout planning |
| **Custom mosaic pattern** | +$30-$60/m2 | Highly labour-intensive |
| **Mitred edges (shadow line)** | $35-$65/linear m | Per linear metre, not per m2 |

**Key notes:**
- Herringbone is the most commonly requested pattern premium in Australian residential renovations
- The premium reflects increased cutting, layout precision, and slower installation speed
- Herringbone with large format tiles (e.g., 100x400 or 150x600) is more expensive than with standard subway sizes
- Diagonal patterns waste more tile material (see Section 7.12) in addition to costing more for labour
- Many tilers will quote herringbone and other complex patterns as a fixed per-m2 all-in rate rather than as a surcharge

## 7.3 Splashback Tiling Labour

**Confidence:** HIGH (multiple corroborating sources)

Splashbacks are typically small area, high-precision work. They often attract a minimum charge or are quoted as a fixed price rather than per-m2 because the area is so small that per-m2 rates don't reflect the true effort.

### Per Square Metre (Labour Only)

| Tile Type | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Standard ceramic / subway** | $50/m2 | $70/m2 | $95/m2 | Simple straight lay; standard sizes |
| **Porcelain feature tiles** | $60/m2 | $80/m2 | $110/m2 | May require more precision cutting |
| **Glass mosaic** | $75/m2 | $100/m2 | $140/m2 | Careful handling; transparent adhesive needed |
| **Herringbone pattern** | $70/m2 | $95/m2 | $130/m2 | Pattern premium applies |
| **Large format (single slab)** | $65/m2 | $85/m2 | $120/m2 | Fewer joints but heavy; may need 2 people |

### Per Linear Metre (Alternative Quoting Method)

Some tilers and builders quote kitchen splashbacks per linear metre of bench length rather than per m2. A standard splashback is 600mm high (between bench and overhead cupboards).

| Tile Type | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Standard tiles -- per linear m** | $80/lm | $120/lm | $180/lm | Assumes 600mm height; labour only |
| **Feature / mosaic -- per linear m** | $120/lm | $170/lm | $250/lm | Assumes 600mm height; labour only |
| **Full height (bench to ceiling)** | $150/lm | $220/lm | $350/lm | 900-1200mm height; labour only |

### Fixed-Price Splashback Projects (Labour Only)

| Scenario | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Small kitchen splashback (2-3m2)** | $300 | $500 | $800 | Minimum charge often applies |
| **Average kitchen splashback (3-5m2)** | $400 | $700 | $1,200 | Most common quote range |
| **Large / L-shaped kitchen (5-8m2)** | $600 | $1,000 | $1,600 | Multiple corners and cuts |

**Key notes:**
- Many tilers have a minimum charge of $300-$500 for splashback work regardless of the area size
- Splashback tiling requires precision around power points, switches, and window reveals -- each penetration adds time
- Subway tiles in a brick bond pattern are the most commonly quoted splashback configuration in Australia
- Glass tile splashbacks require specialist adhesive (white/transparent) which costs more than standard grey adhesive
- The linear metre method is preferred by builders because it aligns with how kitchens are measured (bench runs)

## 7.4 Room-Based Labour Estimates -- Bathroom

**Confidence:** HIGH (most extensively documented tiling scenario in Australian cost guides)

### Bathroom Floor Tiling

| Bathroom Size | Area | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|---------------|------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Small ensuite floor** | 2-3m2 | $250 | $400 | $600 | Minimum charge likely applies |
| **Standard bathroom floor** | 4-6m2 | $350 | $550 | $800 | Most common residential scenario |
| **Large bathroom floor** | 7-10m2 | $500 | $750 | $1,100 | Includes any shower floor area |

### Bathroom Wall Tiling -- Full Height (Floor to Ceiling)

Full-height wall tiling is the current design trend in Australian bathrooms. Typical wall area for full-height tiling is 15-25m2 depending on bathroom size and layout.

| Bathroom Size | Wall Area | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Small ensuite walls** | 12-16m2 | $700 | $1,100 | $1,600 | Single vanity, shower, toilet |
| **Standard bathroom walls** | 16-22m2 | $1,000 | $1,500 | $2,200 | Bath, shower, vanity, toilet |
| **Large bathroom walls** | 22-30m2 | $1,400 | $2,100 | $3,200 | Freestanding bath, double vanity |

### Complete Bathroom Tiling (Floor + Walls + Shower -- Labour Only)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Small ensuite retile** | $1,200 | $1,800 | $3,000 | Basic tiles, straight lay |
| **Standard family bathroom retile** | $1,800 | $3,000 | $5,000 | Mid-range tiles, some pattern work |
| **Large / premium bathroom** | $3,500 | $5,500 | $9,000+ | Large format, herringbone, feature walls |

### Complete Bathroom Tiling (Labour + Materials -- Total Installed Cost)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Small ensuite** | $1,800 | $3,500 | $6,000 | Including budget-mid tiles |
| **Standard family bathroom** | $3,800 | $6,500 | $10,000 | Including mid-range tiles |
| **Large / premium bathroom** | $7,000 | $12,000 | $18,000+ | Including premium tiles + features |

**Key notes:**
- Bathroom tiling is quoted at the higher end of per-m2 rates because of the small areas, many cuts, waterproofing requirements, and wet-area compliance
- Shower floor tiling (with falls to waste) is more labour-intensive and is often quoted separately or at a premium rate
- Shower niches add $150-$450 each (labour) depending on whether they are prefabricated or site-built
- Half-height tiling (to 1200mm) is approximately 40-50% of the full-height wall tiling cost
- These estimates assume substrate is ready for tiling. Add waterproofing (Section 7.8) and any substrate prep (Section 7.9) separately

## 7.5 Room-Based Labour Estimates -- Kitchen, Living, Outdoor

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (fewer detailed breakdowns than bathroom; data triangulated from multiple sources)

### Kitchen Splashback (Typically 3-5m2)

See Section 7.3 for detailed splashback pricing. Summary:

| Quality Tier | Labour Only | Labour + Materials | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Budget (ceramic subway)** | $300-$700 | $500-$1,000 | Straight lay, standard tiles |
| **Mid-range (porcelain feature)** | $500-$1,000 | $800-$1,500 | Brick bond or herringbone |
| **Premium (glass mosaic / stone)** | $800-$1,400 | $1,400-$2,500 | Designer tiles, complex pattern |

### Kitchen Floor Tiling (8-12m2 typical)

| Quality Tier | Labour Only | Labour + Materials | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Budget** | $500-$800 | $800-$1,400 | Standard porcelain, straight lay |
| **Mid-range** | $700-$1,100 | $1,200-$2,200 | Quality porcelain, 600x600 |
| **Premium** | $1,000-$1,600 | $2,000-$3,500 | Large format, herringbone |

### Living Room / Open Plan Floor Tiling (20-30m2)

| Quality Tier | Labour Only | Labour + Materials | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Budget** | $1,000-$1,800 | $1,800-$3,500 | Standard porcelain, straight lay |
| **Mid-range** | $1,500-$2,400 | $3,000-$5,500 | Quality porcelain, 600x600 or 600x1200 |
| **Premium** | $2,000-$3,500 | $5,000-$9,000+ | Large format, pattern, natural stone |

### Outdoor Patio Tiling (15-25m2)

| Quality Tier | Labour Only | Labour + Materials | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Budget** | $1,000-$1,500 | $1,800-$3,000 | Outdoor ceramic, straight lay |
| **Mid-range** | $1,400-$2,200 | $2,800-$5,000 | Outdoor porcelain, non-slip rated |
| **Premium** | $2,000-$3,500 | $4,500-$8,000+ | Natural stone, complex layout |

**Key notes:**
- Outdoor tiling typically costs 10-20% more than indoor floor tiling due to substrate preparation, falls for drainage, and the need for outdoor-rated adhesive and grout
- Living room / open plan areas benefit from economies of scale -- the per-m2 rate drops for larger areas compared to small bathrooms
- Kitchen floor tiling costs are similar to living room per-m2 rates but total project cost is lower due to smaller area
- Outdoor tiles must be slip-rated (R10 minimum, R11 or R12 recommended for pool surrounds) -- these tiles typically cost 10-15% more than indoor equivalents
- Outdoor tiling may require additional concrete slab preparation ($50-$80/m2) if the existing slab is not level or has surface defects

## 7.6 City-Based Labour Rate Comparison

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent city differentials across multiple sources)

All rates below are for **standard floor tiling (600x600 porcelain, straight lay, labour only)** on prepared substrate. These represent the typical range tilers charge in each city.

| City | LOW | MID | HIGH | Index (Sydney=100) |
|------|-----|-----|------|-------------------|
| **Sydney** | $55/m2 | $70/m2 | $95/m2 | 100 |

| **Perth** | $50/hr | $65/hr | $90/hr | Mining sector competition |
| **Adelaide** | $40/hr | $55/hr | $75/hr | Most competitive capital city |

### State-Based Total Cost per m2 (Labour + Standard Porcelain Tile Supply)

| State | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **NSW** | $80/m2 | $120/m2 | $175/m2 | Sydney metro premium |
| **VIC** | $75/m2 | $110/m2 | $165/m2 | Melbourne metro premium |
| **QLD** | $65/m2 | $100/m2 | $140/m2 | Brisbane; regional QLD lower |
| **WA** | $70/m2 | $105/m2 | $155/m2 | Perth metro; trades in demand |
| **SA** | $55/m2 | $90/m2 | $125/m2 | Adelaide; most affordable capital |

**Key notes:**
- Sydney commands the highest tiling rates nationally, driven by cost of living, high demand, and traffic/travel time costs
- Adelaide is consistently the most affordable capital city for tiling -- up to 40% less than Sydney for equivalent work
- Perth rates have increased significantly in recent years due to mining sector competition for tradespeople
- Melbourne rates are close to Sydney but slightly lower on average
- Brisbane offers a mid-range price point with growing demand
- Regional areas within each state typically run 15-25% below capital city rates
- These rates are for standard residential work. Commercial, high-rise, and heritage work attract premium rates

## 7.7 Associated Costs -- Preparation and Removal

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-documented across multiple sources)

### Existing Tile Removal

| Scenario | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Floor tile removal (ceramic/porcelain on adhesive)** | $30/m2 | $45/m2 | $65/m2 | Standard removal with jackhammer |
| **Floor tile removal (tiles on screed/sand-cement)** | $40/m2 | $55/m2 | $75/m2 | Thicker bed = more labour |
| **Wall tile removal** | $30/m2 | $45/m2 | $60/m2 | Risk of damaging substrate behind |
| **Natural stone / thick tile removal** | $45/m2 | $60/m2 | $80/m2 | Heavier; slower; more dust |
| **Adhesive grinding after removal** | $15/m2 | $25/m2 | $40/m2 | To leave smooth substrate |
| **Disposal / skip bin** | $200 | $400 | $700 | Per project; depends on volume |

### Full Bathroom Demolition (Tile Strip)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Small ensuite (floor + walls)** | $400 | $700 | $1,200 | Including disposal |
| **Standard bathroom (floor + walls)** | $600 | $1,200 | $2,000 | Including disposal |
| **Large bathroom (floor + walls)** | $1,000 | $1,800 | $3,000 | Including disposal |

**Key notes:**
- Some tilers include removal in their overall quote; others sub-contract it or expect the builder/homeowner to arrange separately
- Dust-free tile removal (using vacuum-equipped machinery) costs 20-30% more but is increasingly requested for occupied homes
- Asbestos-containing tiles or adhesive (common in pre-1990 homes) require specialist licensed removal at significantly higher cost ($50-$100+/m2)
- Wall tile removal carries the risk of damaging the substrate (plasterboard or villaboard), potentially requiring replacement rather than just re-tiling
- Tip fees and skip bin costs vary by council area; factor $200-$700 per bathroom for disposal

## 7.8 Associated Costs -- Waterproofing

**Confidence:** HIGH (well-regulated in Australia under AS 3740; widely documented)

Waterproofing is mandatory in Australian wet areas (bathrooms, laundries, shower recesses) under AS 3740. It must be performed by a licensed waterproofer or a tiler with waterproofing endorsement. An independent compliance certificate is required before tiling commences.

### Liquid-Applied Membrane (Most Common Method)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Per m2 (materials only)** | $15/m2 | $25/m2 | $40/m2 | Primer + 2 coats of membrane |
| **Per m2 (labour only)** | $25/m2 | $40/m2 | $55/m2 | Application + bond breakers + tape |
| **Per m2 (supply + install)** | $40/m2 | $60/m2 | $80/m2 | Complete waterproofing per m2 |

### Project-Based Waterproofing Costs

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Shower recess only (3-5m2)** | $350 | $500 | $800 | Floor + walls to min 1800mm |
| **Small ensuite (6-10m2)** | $400 | $650 | $1,000 | Shower + floor + walls as req'd |
| **Standard bathroom (10-15m2)** | $500 | $900 | $1,500 | Full wet area compliance |
| **Large bathroom (15-20m2)** | $700 | $1,200 | $1,800 | Full wet area compliance |
| **Laundry (floor only, 4-6m2)** | $250 | $400 | $600 | Floor + 150mm wall turn-up |

### Compliance Certificate

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Waterproofing compliance certificate** | $100-$250 | Required before tiling; issued by waterproofer |
| **Independent inspection (if required)** | $150-$350 | Some councils or certifiers require third-party inspection |

**Key notes:**
- Waterproofing is a SEPARATE trade from tiling in most states. Even if the tiler applies the membrane, they need a waterproofing licence/endorsement
- The membrane must cure for a minimum of 24-72 hours (depending on product) before tiling can commence
- Common products: Davco K10, Ardex WPM 300/310, Laticrete Hydro Ban, Mapei Mapelastic
- AS 3740 specifies minimum waterproofing heights: shower walls to 1800mm above finished floor, bathroom walls to 150mm, and 150mm up any adjacent walls
- Waterproofing failure is the #1 cause of bathroom tiling disputes and defect claims -- it is not an area to cut costs
- Some tilers provide an "all-in" quote that includes waterproofing; always confirm whether it is included

## 7.9 Associated Costs -- Substrates, Screeds, and Levelling

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (pricing varies more than other categories; substrate condition is highly variable)

### Floor Levelling Compound (Self-Levelling)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Supply only per m2** | $18/m2 | $25/m2 | $35/m2 | Primer + levelling compound |
| **Supply + install on concrete** | $35/m2 | $50/m2 | $70/m2 | Up to ~10mm average depth |
| **Supply + install on timber** | $50/m2 | $70/m2 | $95/m2 | Requires flexible compound; more prep |
| **Deep fill (>10mm)** | $50/m2 | $75/m2 | $100/m2 | Additional compound required |

### Shower Floor Screed (Fall to Waste)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Standard shower screed (per shower)** | $300 | $500 | $800 | Sand-cement screed with correct falls |
| **Hobless / step-down shower screed** | $450 | $700 | $1,100 | More complex falls; drainage channel |

### Cement Sheet Substrate (Villaboard / Fibre Cement)

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **6mm Villaboard supply per m2** | $12/m2 | $18/m2 | $25/m2 | James Hardie Villaboard or equivalent |
| **9mm Villaboard supply per m2** | $16/m2 | $22/m2 | $30/m2 | For heavier tiles or floor applications |
| **Supply + install per m2** | $35/m2 | $55/m2 | $75/m2 | Including framing attachment, jointing |
| **Bathroom full reline (walls)** | $600 | $1,000 | $1,600 | Standard bathroom; after removing old lining |

**Key notes:**
- Floor levelling is often required in renovation work where existing flooring has been removed, revealing an uneven substrate
- Shower screeds must achieve a minimum fall of 1:80 (1.25%) to the waste point per AS 3740 -- incorrect falls will cause ponding
- Villaboard (fibre cement) is the standard wet-area wall lining in Australia; it is required behind tiles in showers and wet areas where plasterboard is not rated
- The cost to install Villaboard includes the sheet, screws, jointing compound, and fibre tape at joints
- Timber subfloor preparation for tiling is more expensive because it requires decoupling membranes or flexible adhesives to prevent cracking
- Sydney rates for levelling tend to be $40-$65/m2; regional areas may be $30-$50/m2

## 7.10 Associated Costs -- Grout and Finishing

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (grout pricing well-documented; epoxy premium consistent)

### Standard Cement Grout

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Cement grout supply per m2** | $3-$8/m2 | Standard sanded or unsanded; colour matched |
| **Labour for grouting** | Usually included | Grouting is typically included in the tiler's per-m2 rate |

### Epoxy Grout Premium

| Scope | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Epoxy grout additional cost per m2 (over cement)** | $12/m2 | $20/m2 | $35/m2 | Material premium + additional labour |
| **Epoxy grout material only per m2** | $8/m2 | $15/m2 | $25/m2 | 3-5x the cost of cement grout per m2 |
| **Epoxy grout labour premium** | $5/m2 | $8/m2 | $15/m2 | Faster working time; cleanup intensive |

### Other Finishing Items

| Item | LOW | MID | HIGH | Notes |
|------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Tile adhesive supply per m2** | $6/m2 | $10/m2 | $18/m2 | Standard cement-based; more for large format |
| **Premium adhesive (large format / stone)** | $12/m2 | $18/m2 | $28/m2 | Deformable / rapid-set for heavy tiles |
| **Edge trim (aluminium) per linear m** | $8/lm | $15/lm | $25/lm | Supply and install; various profiles |
| **Mitred edge (45-degree) per linear m** | $35/lm | $50/lm | $65/lm | Labour-intensive; polished edge finish |
| **Silicone sealant per linear m** | $5/lm | $10/lm | $18/lm | All tile-to-fixture and change-of-plane joints |
| **Tile sealing (natural stone) per m2** | $8/m2 | $15/m2 | $25/m2 | Impregnating sealer; 1-2 coats |
| **Shower niche (prefab, installed)** | $150 | $250 | $400 | Single niche; tiled internally |
| **Shower niche (site-built, installed)** | $250 | $400 | $600 | Custom size; more labour |
| **Shower seat / bench (tiled)** | $300 | $500 | $800 | Including waterproofing and tiling |

**Key notes:**
- Epoxy grout is strongly recommended for shower floors, kitchen splashbacks, and any area exposed to staining or heavy moisture. It costs significantly more but does not require sealing and resists mould
- Common epoxy grout brands in Australia: Davco Grout FX, Mapei Kerapoxy, Ardex EG15
- Standard cement grout should be sealed 2-4 weeks after installation (additional cost if tiler provides this service)
- Mitred edges are a significant cost adder -- a typical bathroom vanity niche or shelf edge might have 2-4 linear metres of mitred edges at $35-$65/lm each
- Natural stone tiles (marble, travertine, granite) must be sealed before grouting and again after installation

**Key notes:**
- Tile prices can vary significantly even within the same retailer depending on the specific collection, finish, and format
- Online tile retailers (TileCloud, TFO) often offer 20-40% savings over bricks-and-mortar showrooms for comparable quality
- Natural stone has additional costs: sealing before installation, sealing after grouting, and ongoing maintenance sealing every 1-3 years
- Always order 10-20% extra (see Section 7.12 for wastage allowances) -- dye lots vary, and replacement tiles may not be available if you run short
- Rectified tiles (machine-cut to precise dimensions) allow tighter grout joints (1.5-2mm) and look more contemporary but cost 10-20% more than non-rectified equivalents
- Large format tiles may require purchasing a notch trowel ($30-$50) and large-format suction cups ($50-$150) if the tiler doesn't supply these

## 7.12 Wastage Allowances

**Confidence:** HIGH (industry-standard recommendations; corroborated by Australian tile calculators and builder guides)

Wastage allowances should be added to the calculated tile area to account for cuts, breakages, and future repairs.

### Recommended Wastage by Pattern and Scenario

| Pattern / Scenario | Wastage % | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Straight lay, rectangular room** | 10% | Industry standard minimum; covers cuts and breakages |
| **Straight lay, irregular room (many angles)** | 12-15% | More cuts at walls and obstacles |
| **Brick bond / offset** | 10% | Similar to straight lay |
| **Diagonal / diamond lay** | 15-20% | All edge tiles are cut at 45 degrees |
| **Herringbone / chevron** | 15-20% | Significant cutting at perimeters |
| **Basketweave / Versailles** | 15-20% | Multiple sizes; layout complexity |
| **Large format in small room** | 15-20% | Fewer tiles per m2 but each cut tile wastes more material |
| **Large format (600x1200+) in standard room** | 10-12% | Fewer cuts needed, but each waste piece is large |
| **Mosaic / small format in large room** | 10-12% | Many pieces but less material wasted per cut |
| **Mosaic / small format in small room** | 12-15% | More perimeter cuts relative to area |
| **Natural stone (variable)** | 15-20% | Veining direction matching; colour sorting; more breakage |

### Additional Tile to Hold for Repairs

| Scenario | Extra Allowance | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Standard renovation** | 1-2 m2 extra | Or one full box beyond wastage calculation |
| **Discontinued or imported tile** | 5% extra | May not be available for future repairs |
| **Natural stone** | 3-5% extra | Dye lot matching critical |

**Key notes:**
- NEVER order exactly the calculated area -- at absolute minimum, order 10% extra
- For herringbone and diagonal patterns, 15% is the safe minimum; 20% is recommended for peace of mind
- Large format tiles in small bathrooms (e.g., 600x1200 in a 4m2 bathroom) can produce surprisingly high wastage because partial tiles cannot be reused easily
- Always confirm with the tiler how many square metres they recommend ordering -- they account for their cutting method and layout plan
- Keep leftover tiles from the same batch. If a tile cracks or a repair is needed in 3-5 years, matching a discontinued tile can be impossible
- Tile batches (dye lots) can vary in shade. Never mix batches without checking for shade variation first

## 7.13 Factors That Affect Pricing

**Confidence:** HIGH (universally acknowledged across all sources)

### Location

| Factor | Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Sydney / Melbourne metro** | Highest rates nationally | 20-40% premium over regional and Adelaide |
| **Brisbane metro** | Mid-range | Growing market; 10-20% below Sydney |
| **Perth metro** | Upper-mid range | Mining sector competition for trades |
| **Adelaide metro** | Most affordable capital | Up to 40% below Sydney for equivalent work |
| **Regional areas** | 15-25% below capital | But may attract travel charges |
| **Remote / rural** | Variable | Limited tiler availability; travel charges apply |

### Access Difficulty

| Factor | Impact | Detail |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Ground floor, easy access** | Baseline pricing | Standard quote applies |

| **Curved walls** | +30-50% | Small tiles required; significantly more labour |
| **Shower niches** | +$150-$450 each | Tiling all 5 internal faces |
| **Mitred edges** | +$35-$65/lm | Labour-intensive precision work |

---

## 7.14 When Pricing Increases Significantly

**Confidence:** HIGH

The following scenarios consistently push tiling costs toward or beyond the HIGH end of the ranges listed above:

| Scenario | Why It Costs More |
|----------|------------------|
| **Asbestos tile or adhesive removal** | Licensed removalist required; strict disposal protocols; $50-$100+/m2 just for removal |
| **Concrete slab with embedded heating** | Cannot use mechanical fixing; special adhesive; risk of damage |
| **Heritage or period home** | Non-standard substrates; heritage compliance; specialised techniques |
| **Large format tile on walls (1200x2400+ slabs)** | Two-person minimum; specialist adhesive; mechanical support during cure |
| **Marble or natural stone (premium grades)** | Careful handling; sealing; matching veining; higher breakage rate |
| **Epoxy grout throughout** | 3-5x grout material cost; faster working time requirement; specialist skill |
| **Waterproofing remediation (failed membrane)** | Strip tiles, re-waterproof, re-tile; effectively doing the job twice |
| **Significant height work** | Scaffolding or platform hire; safety requirements; slower pace |
| **Very tight timelines** | Tilers may charge premium for rushed work; adhesive/grout cure times are fixed |
| **Weekend or after-hours work** | 1.5-2x standard rates for out-of-hours work |

---

## 7.15 How to Read a Tiler's Quote

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on industry practice and consumer guides)

A professional tiler's quote should itemise the following. If any of these are missing or unclear, the homeowner should ask before accepting:

### What Should Be Included

| Line Item | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Labour rate** | Per m2 or fixed price? Does it cover all areas (floor, walls, splashback)? |
| **Tile supply** | Is the tiler supplying tiles or is the homeowner? If tiler-supplied, what brand/model? |
| **Adhesive and grout** | Usually included in labour quote. Confirm grout type (cement vs epoxy) |
| **Waterproofing** | Is it included or separate? Who provides the compliance certificate? |
| **Substrate preparation** | Is levelling, screeding, or substrate repair included or additional? |
| **Tile removal** | If retiling, is old tile removal and disposal included? |
| **Cutting and wastage** | Are all cuts included in the per-m2 rate? Who supplies the tiles for wastage? |
| **Silicone and finishing** | All change-of-plane joints, tile-to-fixture joints |
| **Clean-up and disposal** | Removal of packaging, offcuts, dust, and general clean-up |
| **Timeline** | Expected start date, duration, and any cure-time pauses |
| **Payment terms** | Deposit amount, progress payments, final payment |
| **Warranty** | What is warranted, for how long, and does it cover waterproofing? |

### Common Quote Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Per m2 (labour only)** | Homeowner supplies tiles. Tiler charges for installation. Most transparent for cost comparison |
| **Per m2 (supply and install)** | Tiler supplies tiles and installs. Convenient but harder to compare tile quality |
| **Fixed price per room** | Common for bathrooms. Covers everything for the defined scope. Best for budget certainty |
| **Day rate** | $500-$900/day. Less common for renovation tiling; more common for builders' tilers doing new builds |

### Red Flags in Tiling Quotes

| Red Flag | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **No mention of waterproofing** | Either not included (must be arranged separately) or being skipped (non-compliant) |
| **"Labour + materials" with no detail** | Cannot verify tile quality or adhesive/grout type |
| **No mention of substrate preparation** | May lead to extras once work begins |
| **Cash-only, no written quote** | No paper trail for warranty claims or defect disputes |
| **Significantly below market rate** | May indicate unlicensed tiler, inferior materials, or cutting corners on waterproofing |
| **Large upfront deposit (>30%)** | Industry standard is 10-20% deposit, progress payments, final payment on completion |

### Cross-Reference Notes

- All prices have been cross-referenced across a minimum of 3 sources where possible
- City-specific data was validated against local tiling company websites for each capital city
- Where sources conflicted, the median range was used and noted with MEDIUM confidence
- Prices reflect the 2024-2026 market. Construction cost inflation in Australia has been running at approximately 4-6% per annum since 2022, so prices at the time of reading may be higher than ranges shown
- All prices include GST (10%) as this is how residential consumers are quoted in Australia
