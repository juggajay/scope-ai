## 1. Why Substrate Preparation Matters

Substrate preparation is where the majority of tiling failures originate. Inadequate or incorrect surface preparation is the single most common cause of failure when bonding tiles to surfaces. A perfectly installed tile on a poorly prepared substrate will fail; an adequately installed tile on a well-prepared substrate will last decades.

**Key principle:** The substrate must be structurally sound, dimensionally stable, flat to tolerance, clean, dry (or appropriately moisture-managed), and primed or treated to accept adhesive. Every substrate type has specific requirements that must be met before tiling commences.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- This principle is universally accepted across all Australian tile adhesive manufacturers (ARDEX, Davco/Sika, Mapei, Dunlop) and codified in AS 3958:2023.

### Governing Standards

| Standard | Title | Relevance |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **AS 3958:2023** | Ceramic Tiles -- Installation of Ceramic and Stone Tiles | Primary tiling installation standard. Covers substrate types, preparation, adhesive selection, flatness tolerances, grouting, movement joints |
| **AS 3958.1:2007** | Guide to the Installation of Ceramic Tiles | Predecessor standard, still widely referenced. Replaced by AS 3958:2023 |
| **AS 3740:2021** | Waterproofing of Domestic Wet Areas | Governs waterproofing in bathrooms, showers, laundries. Tiling occurs over waterproofing membrane |
| **AS/NZS 2588** | Gypsum Plasterboard | Specifies water-resistant grade plasterboard requirements |
| **NCC (National Construction Code)** | Building Code of Australia | References AS 3958 and AS 3740 for compliance |

### Universal Substrate Requirements (All Types)

All substrates must be:
- **Structurally sound** -- No movement, cracking, or deterioration
- **Clean** -- Free of dust, oil, grease, wax, curing compounds, paint, release agents, and any loose or contaminating material
- **Flat to tolerance** -- Maximum deviation of 3-4mm under a 2m straightedge (per AS 3958)
- **Dry** -- Or at an acceptable moisture content for the adhesive system being used
- **Primed** -- With a primer compatible with both the substrate and the adhesive being used

## 2. Cement Sheet (Fibre Cement)

### 2.1 What It Is

Compressed fibre cement (CFC) sheet is a high-density, moisture-resistant board made from cement, cellulose fibres, and silica. It is the preferred substrate for tiling in wet areas on framed construction (timber or steel stud walls and timber joist floors). It does not swell, rot, or deteriorate when exposed to moisture, making it far superior to plasterboard as a tile substrate in wet areas.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 2.2 When It Is Required

| Application | Required? | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Wet area walls (bathroom, shower, laundry) | **Strongly recommended** | Preferred over moisture-resistant plasterboard for durability. Required by most waterproofing system warranties |
| Wet area floors (framed construction) | **Required** | Minimum 15mm CFC over timber joists per AS 3958 |
| Kitchen splashback | Optional | Plasterboard acceptable if not in a designated wet area |
| Dry area walls | Optional | Plasterboard is acceptable and more common |
| External areas (balconies) | **Required** | Must be compressed fibre cement, not standard fibre cement |

### 2.3 Thickness Requirements

| Application | Minimum Thickness | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Wall lining (tiled)** | 6mm (light tiles) / 9mm (standard/large tiles) | 6mm Villaboard on studs at max 400mm centres for tiled applications |
| **Wall lining (untiled)** | 6mm | Standard Villaboard lining thickness |
| **Floor underlay (tiled)** | 15mm compressed sheet | Must be compressed (high-density) fibre cement, not standard Villaboard |
| **External floor/balcony** | 15mm compressed sheet | Additional waterproofing and drainage requirements apply |

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Sourced from James Hardie Villaboard Installation Guide (Australia, April 2023) and Beaumont Tiles Surface Preparation Guide.

### 2.4 Major Brands in Australia

| Brand | Product | Type | Common Sizes |
|-------|---------|------|--------------|
| **James Hardie** | Villaboard Lining | Wall lining (6mm, 9mm) | 2400x1200, 2700x1200, 3000x1200 |

| **Fixing** | Pre-drill screw holes. Screws driven 2-3mm below sheet face |
| **Sheet joints** | Stagger joints. Do not align with joist centrelines |
| **Adhesive** | Construction adhesive between sheet and joists recommended for additional rigidity |

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Sourced from James Hardie Villaboard Installation Guide (Australia) and BGC Compressed Fibre Cement technical data.

### 2.6 Preparation for Tiling

1. **Remove surface dust** -- Most fibre cement sheets have a surface layer of manufacturing dust. Remove with a damp sponge or cloth. Do not use excessive water
2. **Check flatness** -- Verify with a 2m straightedge. Maximum deviation 3-4mm
3. **Treat joints** -- Apply flexible barrier coating with reinforcement fibreglass mesh tape over all sheet-to-sheet joints to minimise risk of cracking at joints
4. **Prime** -- Apply a compatible primer to the entire surface. Fibre cement is porous and must be sealed before tiling
5. **Allow primer to dry** -- Typically 30-40 minutes at 20 degrees Celsius

### 2.7 Primer Compatibility

| Primer | Manufacturer | Suitable For |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **ARDEX Multiprime** | ARDEX Australia | All fibre cement sheets. General purpose |
| **Davco Ultraprime** | Sika/Davco | Porous substrates including fibre cement |
| **Davco PrimeX** | Sika/Davco | Non-porous and porous substrates, compressed fibre cement |
| **BT Primer** | Beaumont Tiles | General purpose fibre cement primer |

### 2.8 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Tile adhesion failure at sheet joints | No joint treatment / rigid grout over joints | Apply flexible barrier coating with mesh tape over all joints |
| Cracking along sheet joints | Sheet movement at joints, no expansion provision | Treat joints with flexible membrane; use flexible adhesive |
| Tiles debonding from wall | No primer applied; dust not removed | Always prime; always dust/wipe before priming |
| Sheet sagging or deflection (floors) | Joist spacing too wide for 15mm sheet | Verify joist spacing meets manufacturer span tables |
| Moisture behind tiles | Inadequate waterproofing over fibre cement | Waterproofing membrane must be applied per AS 3740 before tiling in wet areas |

### 2.9 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items for fibre cement substrate work (tiling trade):**

- "Verify fibre cement wall lining is securely fixed, flat to tolerance (max 3mm in 2m), and all joints are treated with flexible tape prior to tiling"
- "Prime all fibre cement surfaces with compatible tiling primer prior to adhesive application"
- "Note: Installation of fibre cement sheet is by carpenter/builder -- not included in tiling scope. Tiler to verify substrate condition before commencing"

**Important:** The tiler does NOT install the fibre cement sheet. That is carpentry/building work. The tiler is responsible for verifying it is suitable, priming it, and tiling over it.

---

## 3. Existing Tiles (Tile-on-Tile)

### 3.1 What It Is

Tiling over existing tiles (tile-on-tile or overlay) involves bonding new tiles directly over an existing tiled surface without removing the old tiles. This is increasingly common in renovation work to avoid the cost, mess, and time of tile removal.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.2 When It Is Acceptable

Tile-on-tile installation is acceptable when ALL of the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Requirement | Test Method |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Existing tiles are sound** | No loose, cracked, or drummy tiles | Tap test (knuckle rap) across entire surface. Hollow sound = drummy = not suitable |
| **Surface is level** | Maximum variation of 5mm across a 3m span for interior floors | 2m or 3m straightedge measurement |
| **No moisture issues** | Substrate is dry, no evidence of water damage or mould | Visual inspection; moisture meter if suspect |
| **Structural capacity** | Floor/wall can support additional weight of new tiles + adhesive (approx. 20-35 kg/m2 additional) | Structural assessment for floors; wall substrate check for walls |
| **Height build-up is acceptable** | Additional 12-20mm floor height does not affect door clearances, transitions, step heights | Physical measurement of available clearance |
| **Waterproofing integrity** | In wet areas, existing waterproofing must be confirmed intact | Compliance certificate from original work, or flood test. If unknown, tile-on-tile in wet areas is HIGH RISK |

### 3.3 When It Is NOT Acceptable

**Do NOT tile over existing tiles when:**

- Any tiles are loose, cracked, drummy (hollow-sounding), or debonded
- The surface is uneven beyond tolerance
- There is evidence of water damage, mould, or failed waterproofing
- The existing tiles are on a flexible or unsuitable substrate (vinyl, timber, laminate)
- Floor height build-up will create trip hazards at transitions (door thresholds, adjacent rooms)
- The additional weight exceeds the structural capacity of the substrate (particularly on walls with plasterboard backing)
- In wet areas where the waterproofing status is unknown or suspect -- this is the most critical "no" scenario
- Tiles larger than the existing tiles (larger tiles need a flatter substrate)

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Sourced from ARDEX Australia TB117.012 (July 2024) and Elegance Tiles Australia guide.

### 3.4 Preparation Method

1. **Tap test** -- Systematically tap every tile with knuckles or a rubber mallet. Mark any drummy (hollow) tiles. If more than 5-10% are drummy, full removal is recommended
2. **Remove loose tiles** -- Any drummy or loose tiles must be removed and the void patched with adhesive/levelling compound, flush with surrounding tiles
3. **Clean thoroughly** -- Existing tiles must be completely free of oils, grime, soap residue, silicone, wax, and any contaminant. Industrial degreaser or sugar soap wash required
4. **Mechanically abrade the surface** -- Sand or grind the glazed surface to create a mechanical key. Use a diamond cup grinder or orbital sander with coarse grit. The goal is to roughen the glaze, not remove it entirely. Alternatively, use an angle grinder with diamond cup wheel
5. **Apply bonding primer** -- Apply a textured bonding primer designed for non-porous surfaces. ARDEX P4 or Davco PrimeX are standard choices in Australia. The primer creates a textured surface that cement-based adhesives can grip
6. **Allow primer to cure** -- ARDEX P4 dries in approximately 30 minutes. Follow manufacturer specifications
7. **Select correct adhesive** -- Must use a HIGH-POLYMER-MODIFIED cement-based adhesive (e.g., ARDEX X77, Davco Ultraflex). Standard cement-only adhesives will NOT achieve adequate bond to tile-on-tile

### 3.5 Adhesive Requirements

| Adhesive Type | Suitable for Tile-on-Tile? | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Standard cement-based (C1 class) | **NO** | Insufficient bond strength on non-porous surfaces |
| Polymer-modified cement-based (C2 class) | **YES** | Minimum requirement. Must be high-polymer content |
| Epoxy adhesive | **YES** | Excellent bond but more expensive and harder to work with |
| Pre-mixed mastic | **NO** | Not suitable for tile-on-tile applications |

**Recommended Australian products for tile-on-tile:**
- ARDEX X77 Microtec (flexible, rapid-set, polymer-modified)
- Davco Ultraflex (premium grade polymer-modified)
- Mapei Kerabond + Isolastic (two-part polymer system)

### 3.6 Weight and Height Considerations

| Factor | Typical Value | Impact |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Additional height** | 12-20mm (tile + adhesive bed) | Door clearances, transition strips, step heights |
| **Additional weight (floor)** | 20-35 kg/m2 | Structural load on floor framing. Usually acceptable on concrete slab; check on timber floors |
| **Additional weight (wall)** | 20-35 kg/m2 | Combined weight of old tiles + new tiles + adhesive may exceed plasterboard limit of 32 kg/m2 |
| **Porcelain tile weight** | ~2.4 kg/m2 per mm thickness | 10mm porcelain = ~24 kg/m2 |
| **Adhesive weight** | ~2.2 kg/m2 per mm thickness | 3mm bed = ~6.5 kg/m2 |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 3.7 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| New tiles debonding from old | Inadequate surface preparation (no grinding, no primer) | Always grind/abrade AND prime. Use polymer-modified adhesive only |
| Cracking at grout joints | Existing tiles have micro-movement not addressed | Use flexible adhesive and grout. Install movement joints |
| Waterproofing failure in wet areas | Original waterproofing compromised but not visible | In wet areas, confirm waterproofing certificate or remove and redo |
| Door won't close | Floor height increased by 15-20mm | Measure door clearance BEFORE quoting. Include door trimming in scope if needed |
| Transition trip hazard | Height difference at boundary with adjacent untiled floor | Include transition strip/ramp in scope |

### 3.8 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Prepare existing tiled surface: tap test all tiles, remove and patch any drummy tiles, degrease and clean entire surface"
- "Mechanically abrade existing tile surface using diamond cup grinder to create adhesion key"
- "Apply bonding primer (ARDEX P4 or equivalent) to prepared surface"
- "Supply and fix [tile description] over existing tiles using polymer-modified adhesive (ARDEX X77 or equivalent)"
- "Allowance: Door trimming to accommodate increased floor height -- by carpenter [EXCLUDED from tiling scope]"
- "Allowance: Transition strip at junction with [adjacent room] to manage height difference"

**Important note for scope:** If waterproofing status in a wet area is unknown, the scope should recommend full tile removal and waterproofing redo rather than tile-on-tile. This must be flagged clearly.

## 4. Plasterboard

### 4.1 What It Is

Plasterboard (also called gypsum board, drywall, or Gyprock) is the most common wall lining in Australian residential construction. There are two types relevant to tiling:

- **Standard plasterboard** (grey/white paper face) -- For dry areas only
- **Water-resistant plasterboard** (green paper face, commonly called "green board") -- For wet areas. Brands include Gyprock Aquachek, Knauf Moisture Shield, USG Boral AquaProtect

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 4.2 When You Can Tile on Plasterboard

| Application | Standard Plasterboard | Water-Resistant (Green Board) |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Dry area wall (kitchen splashback, laundry above bench) | **YES** -- with weight limits | **YES** -- with weight limits |
| Wet area wall (bathroom, shower recess, above bath) | **NO** | **YES** -- complies with BCA for wet area wall linings when installed per manufacturer guide |
| Floor | **NO** -- never | **NO** -- never |
| Ceiling (tiled) | **NOT RECOMMENDED** | **NOT RECOMMENDED** -- extreme caution and engineering advice required |

### 4.3 Weight Limit

**Maximum combined tile + adhesive weight on plasterboard: 32 kg/m2**

This limit is specified in AS/NZS 2588 and applies to all Gyprock plasterboard linings. This is the combined weight of tile, adhesive, and grout.

| Tile Type | Tile Thickness | Tile Weight/m2 | Adhesive (3mm bed) | Total Weight | Within 32 kg/m2? |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Ceramic wall tile | 6-8mm | 14-19 kg/m2 | ~6.5 kg/m2 | ~20-26 kg/m2 | YES |
| Porcelain tile | 9-10mm | 22-24 kg/m2 | ~6.5 kg/m2 | ~28-31 kg/m2 | MARGINAL -- check carefully |
| Porcelain tile | 12mm | ~29 kg/m2 | ~6.5 kg/m2 | ~35 kg/m2 | **NO -- exceeds limit** |
| Natural stone | 10-20mm | 25-50 kg/m2 | ~6.5 kg/m2 | ~31-57 kg/m2 | **LIKELY NO** |
| Large format porcelain (600x600+) | 9-10mm | ~24 kg/m2 | ~6.5 kg/m2 | ~31 kg/m2 | MARGINAL |

**Key takeaway:** Standard ceramic wall tiles (up to 8mm thick) are safe on plasterboard. Porcelain tiles above 10mm thick or natural stone tiles will likely exceed the 32 kg/m2 limit. If heavy tiles are specified, the substrate must be upgraded to fibre cement sheet.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Sourced from Gyprock Aquachek product data sheet and AS/NZS 2588.

### 4.4 Water-Resistant Plasterboard (Green Board) Specifications

| Product | Manufacturer | Thickness | Weight | Standard |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Gyprock Aquachek** | CSR | 10mm | 7.1 kg/m2 | AS/NZS 2588 (water-resistant grade) |
| **Gyprock Aquachek** | CSR | 13mm | 9.3 kg/m2 | AS/NZS 2588 (water-resistant grade) |
| **Knauf Moisture Shield** | Knauf | 10mm | ~7.5 kg/m2 | AS/NZS 2588 |
| **USG Boral AquaProtect** | USG Boral | 10mm | ~7.0 kg/m2 | AS/NZS 2588 |

**Important:** Water-resistant plasterboard is NOT waterproof. It resists moisture damage better than standard plasterboard, but a waterproofing membrane (per AS 3740) must still be applied over it in wet areas before tiling.

Gyprock Aquachek has extremely low water absorption characteristics, making it a stable substrate for ceramic tiles. It is not subject to moisture movement, which means tiles bonded to it are less likely to crack or debond due to substrate movement.

### 4.5 Preparation for Tiling

1. **Verify substrate type** -- Confirm water-resistant (green) plasterboard is used in wet areas. Standard plasterboard in a wet area is a defect and must be replaced before tiling
2. **Check fixing** -- Plasterboard must be firmly fixed to studs. No soft spots, no movement when pressed
3. **Verify stud spacing** -- 600mm maximum for standard applications, 450mm maximum if large-format tiles are planned
4. **Seal the surface** -- Apply a compatible primer/sealer. Plasterboard is highly porous and will draw moisture from tile adhesive too quickly, weakening the bond
5. **Apply waterproofing** (wet areas only) -- Waterproofing membrane applied per AS 3740 BEFORE tiling. Tiler does not tile directly onto bare plasterboard in wet areas

### 4.6 Primer Requirements

| Substrate | Primer | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Standard plasterboard (dry areas) | Davco Ultraprime or ARDEX Multiprime | Seals porosity, improves adhesive bond |
| Water-resistant plasterboard (to receive waterproofing) | As specified by waterproofing membrane manufacturer | Primer must be compatible with waterproofing system |
| Water-resistant plasterboard (dry areas, direct tiling) | Davco Ultraprime or ARDEX Multiprime | Standard tiling primer |

### 4.7 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Tiles falling off wall | Weight exceeds 32 kg/m2 limit | Calculate tile + adhesive weight before specifying. Switch to fibre cement if over limit |
| Plasterboard sagging/bulging behind tiles | Moisture ingress in wet area with standard (non-green) plasterboard | Only use water-resistant plasterboard in wet areas |
| Adhesive not bonding | No primer applied; plasterboard absorbed moisture from adhesive | Always prime plasterboard before tiling |
| Cracking around shower/bath | Plasterboard flex due to inadequate fixing or stud spacing too wide | Verify stud spacing. Use fibre cement in shower recesses for maximum rigidity |

### 4.8 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Verify wall substrate is water-resistant plasterboard in all wet areas. Report any non-compliant substrate to builder for replacement prior to tiling"
- "Prime all plasterboard surfaces with compatible tiling primer prior to adhesive application"
- "Note: Tiles specified must not exceed combined weight of 32 kg/m2 (tile + adhesive) on plasterboard substrates"
- "Note: Waterproofing of wet area walls is by waterproofer -- not included in tiling scope. Tiler to verify waterproofing membrane is cured and intact before commencing"

## 5. Concrete Slab

### 5.1 What It Is

Concrete slab is the most common floor substrate in Australian residential construction, particularly for ground-floor slab-on-ground and suspended concrete slabs in multi-storey construction. Concrete is an excellent tiling substrate when properly prepared, as it is rigid, strong, and dimensionally stable once cured.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 5.2 Slab Curing Requirements

| Requirement | Specification | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Minimum curing time** | 28 days (4 weeks) minimum | Allows concrete to reach design strength and reduces moisture content |
| **Recommended curing time before tiling** | 6 weeks (42 days) | Industry standard recommendation per multiple Australian adhesive manufacturers |
| **Slab finish** | Wood float finish preferred | Steel trowel (smooth) finish requires mechanical preparation or specialist primer |
| **Moisture content** | Must pass moisture test before tiling | See Section 5.4 below |

### 5.3 Flatness Tolerances

| Standard | Tolerance | Measurement |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **AS 3958:2023** | 3-4mm deviation maximum | Under a 2m straightedge |
| **Industry best practice** | 3mm maximum for large format tiles (600x600+) | Under a 2m straightedge |
| **Industry best practice** | 5mm maximum for small format tiles (under 300x300) | Under a 3m straightedge |

If the slab exceeds these tolerances, levelling compound or screed is required before tiling (see Section 7).

### 5.4 Moisture Testing

**Why it matters:** Excessive moisture in concrete will prevent proper adhesive curing, cause adhesive failure, and can lead to efflorescence (white salt deposits) pushing tiles off the surface.

| Test Method | Description | Duration | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Plastic sheet test** | Tape a 450mm x 450mm plastic sheet to clean slab. Check for condensation after 24 hours | 24 hours minimum | No visible condensation or darkening under sheet |
| **Moisture meter (electronic)** | Handheld electronic moisture meter pressed to slab surface | Instant reading | Below 5.5% relative moisture (varies by adhesive manufacturer) |
| **Calcium chloride test** | Sealed dome with calcium chloride dish on clean slab surface | 60-72 hours | Below 3 lb/1000 sq ft/24 hours (ASTM F1869 equivalent) |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- Specific pass/fail thresholds vary between adhesive manufacturers and between testing methods. The plastic sheet test is the most commonly used in Australian residential renovation due to its simplicity, but it is qualitative, not quantitative.

### 5.5 Surface Preparation Steps

1. **Assess slab condition** -- Check for cracks (structural vs shrinkage), surface contamination, previous coatings, and flatness
2. **Remove contaminants** -- All oil, grease, wax, paint, curing compounds, laitance, and previous adhesive residue must be removed. Deeply contaminated surfaces must be scabbled or abraded to clean, sound concrete
3. **Mechanical preparation** (if required):
   - **Diamond cup grinding** -- Removes thin coatings, laitance, and creates a textured profile. Standard method for steel-trowelled (smooth) slabs
   - **Scarifying** -- More aggressive than grinding. Creates deeper grooves. Used for thick coatings or very smooth surfaces
   - **Shot blasting** -- Industrial method for large areas. Removes coatings and profiles surface in one pass
4. **Clean after grinding** -- Vacuum all dust and debris. The surface must be completely dust-free
5. **Moisture test** -- Perform plastic sheet test or moisture meter test
6. **Check flatness** -- Measure with 2m straightedge. If out of tolerance, apply levelling compound
7. **Prime** -- Apply appropriate primer:
   - **Wood float finish (standard):** Davco Ultraprime, ARDEX Multiprime, or similar general tiling primer
   - **Steel trowel finish (smooth):** Davco PrimeX or ARDEX P4 (non-porous surface primer) after grinding
   - **Contaminated/residue surfaces:** Davco Ultrabond or Sika Prep n Prime after mechanical cleaning

### 5.6 Slab Finish Types and Preparation Required

| Slab Finish | Description | Tiling Preparation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Wood float** | Slightly rough, open texture. Standard for new slabs intended for tiling | Clean, prime, tile. Minimal prep required |
| **Steel trowel** | Very smooth, closed surface. Common in older homes or polished concrete bases | Must grind with diamond cup to create profile. Then prime with non-porous surface primer (PrimeX/P4) |
| **Power float** | Very smooth, dense surface. Often in commercial/garage slabs | Same as steel trowel -- grind then prime |
| **Broom finish** | Rough textured. Common for external/driveway slabs | Check profile is not too rough (valleys will trap air in adhesive). May need levelling compound |
| **Previously coated** (paint, sealer) | Smooth, often non-porous | Remove coating completely by grinding or shot blasting. Prime exposed concrete |

### 5.7 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Tiles debonding from slab | Slab too smooth (steel trowel) without grinding | Always grind smooth slabs. Always prime |
| White staining on grout (efflorescence) | Excessive moisture in slab migrating through tiles | Moisture test before tiling. Allow adequate curing time |
| Tiles cracking in straight line | Slab has shrinkage or structural crack underneath | Address cracks before tiling. Use crack isolation membrane over cracks. Install movement joints over structural cracks |
| Adhesive not curing | Dusty surface; primer not applied; slab too wet | Clean thoroughly; prime; moisture test |
| Uneven tiles (lippage) | Slab not flat to tolerance | Check flatness. Apply levelling compound where needed |

### 5.8 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Prepare concrete slab for tiling: grind surface using diamond cup grinder to remove laitance and create adhesion profile"
- "Clean slab and remove all dust, debris, and contaminants"
- "Perform moisture test on concrete slab. Report results to client. Tiling will not proceed until moisture levels are acceptable"
- "Prime concrete slab with [primer name] prior to adhesive application"
- "Allowance: Levelling compound to [X] m2 of floor area where slab is out of tolerance (max 3mm in 2m)"
- "Note: Slab must have a minimum 6-week cure before tiling can commence. Builder to confirm pour date"

## 6. Timber Floors

### 6.1 Why You Cannot Tile Directly Onto Timber

**You must NEVER tile directly onto timber floorboards, timber sheet flooring (particle board, plywood), or timber-based substrates without an appropriate separation/decoupling layer.**

The fundamental problem is differential movement:
- Timber expands and contracts with changes in humidity and temperature (seasonal movement can be 1-3mm across a room)
- Ceramic and porcelain tiles are rigid and do not accommodate this movement
- Tile adhesive bonded directly to timber will crack and debond as the timber moves underneath

The result is cracked tiles, cracked grout, and/or tiles completely debonding -- often within 1-3 years.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- This is a universal principle acknowledged by all Australian tiling standards and adhesive manufacturers.

### 6.2 Acceptable Methods for Tiling Over Timber Floors

There are two acceptable approaches:

#### Method 1: Cement Sheet Overlay (Preferred in Australia)

Install 15mm compressed fibre cement sheet (e.g., James Hardie HardiePanel, BGC Compressed) over the existing timber floor structure as a rigid underlayment for tiles.

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Sheet thickness** | 15mm minimum compressed fibre cement |
| **Sheet type** | Must be compressed (high-density) fibre cement. NOT standard Villaboard |
| **Joist spacing** | Maximum 450mm centres for tiled floors |
| **Floor deflection limit** | L/360 (span divided by 360). This means for a 4m span, maximum allowable deflection is 11mm under load |
| **Fixing** | Pre-drill and screw to joists. Construction adhesive between sheet and existing floor |
| **Sheet joints** | Stagger. Do not align with existing floorboard joints or joist centrelines |
| **Existing floor** | Must be structurally sound. No rotten, bouncy, or excessively springy timber |

**Note:** The existing timber floor remains in place underneath. The compressed sheet is an overlay that provides a rigid, dimensionally stable surface for tiling.

#### Method 2: Decoupling Membrane

Install a polyethylene decoupling/uncoupling membrane over the timber substrate (or over a plywood/CFC overlay). The membrane absorbs substrate movement and prevents it from transferring to the tile layer.

| **Schluter DITRA** | Schluter Systems | Polyethylene with square dovetail cavities + anchoring fleece | ~$20-30/m2 |
| **Schluter DITRA-XL** | Schluter Systems | Thicker version for greater uncoupling capacity | ~$30-40/m2 |
| **ARDEX Flexbone** | ARDEX Australia | Uncoupling mat with fleece backing | ~$20-30/m2 |
| **Mapeguard UM** | Mapei | Uncoupling membrane with fleece | ~$20-30/m2 |

**Important considerations for decoupling membranes on timber:**
- DITRA will NOT bond directly to raw floorboards. A 12mm plywood or compressed sheet overlay is typically required as an intermediate layer
- The membrane is bonded to the substrate using a polymer-modified thin-set adhesive
- Tiles are then bonded to the top of the membrane using polymer-modified thin-set
- The total height build-up is significant: existing floor + overlay + membrane + adhesive + tile = 25-40mm additional

**Confidence:** HIGH for cement sheet overlay method; MEDIUM for decoupling membrane method (less commonly used in Australian residential renovation compared to cement sheet overlay).

### 6.3 Floor Structure Assessment

Before any tiling over timber floors, the floor structure must be assessed:

| Check | Requirement | If Failed |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Joist size and spacing** | Adequate for combined load of existing floor + overlay + tiles | Structural engineer to assess; may need sister joists or additional support |
| **Floor bounce/spring** | Minimal deflection when walked on | L/360 deflection limit. Strengthen floor structure if excessive |
| **Rot or termite damage** | None | Replace affected members before proceeding |
| **Moisture content** | Timber at equilibrium moisture content (typically 10-14% in Australia) | Allow timber to acclimatise; address any moisture sources |
| **Level** | Reasonably level overall | Minor unevenness can be packed; severe unevenness needs remediation |

### 6.4 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Tiles cracking along straight lines | Tiles bonded directly to timber without separation layer | NEVER tile directly on timber. Always use CFC overlay or decoupling membrane |
| Grout cracking | Timber floor movement exceeding grout flexibility | Use flexible grout. Install movement joints. Ensure CFC overlay is properly fixed |
| Tiles drumming/debonding | Insufficient adhesive coverage; overlay not rigid enough | Back-butter large tiles. Ensure 15mm CFC minimum. Check joist spacing |
| Floor feels bouncy/spongy | Floor structure inadequate for tile load | Structural assessment before tiling. Do not proceed on inadequate structure |

### 6.5 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Note: Existing timber floor requires 15mm compressed fibre cement sheet overlay before tiling can commence. Supply and installation of cement sheet overlay is by builder/carpenter -- not included in tiling scope"
- "Tiler to verify cement sheet overlay is securely fixed, flat to tolerance, and joints are staggered prior to commencing tiling"
- "Prime cement sheet overlay with compatible tiling primer"
- "Supply and fix [tile description] to prepared cement sheet substrate using polymer-modified adhesive"
- "Allowance: Transition strip at junction with [adjacent room] to manage height difference created by overlay and tiles"

**OR (if decoupling membrane approach):**

- "Supply and install Schluter DITRA uncoupling membrane (or equivalent) over prepared substrate using polymer-modified adhesive"
- "Supply and fix [tile description] to uncoupling membrane using polymer-modified adhesive"

## 7. Levelling Compound

### 7.1 What It Is

Levelling compound (also called self-levelling compound/SLC, floor leveller, or smoothing compound) is a cementitious material that is mixed with water and poured/trowelled onto a substrate to create a flat, smooth surface for tiling. It is used when the existing substrate is out of flatness tolerance.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 7.2 When It Is Needed

| Situation | Levelling Required? |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Concrete slab out of tolerance (more than 3-4mm deviation in 2m) | **YES** |
| Concrete slab with localised low spots or hollows | **YES** -- spot fill with feather-edge compound |
| Timber floor with minor unevenness after CFC overlay | **YES** -- thin skim coat |
| After tile removal where adhesive residue creates an uneven surface | **YES** or grind flat |
| Screed surface that is rough but level | **MAYBE** -- depends on tile adhesive capability |
| Perfectly flat new concrete slab | **NO** -- just prime and tile |

### 7.3 Types of Levelling Compound

| Type | Thickness Range | Application | Drying Time | Best For |
|------|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Self-levelling (SLC)** | 1-40mm (product dependent) | Pour and spread. Flows to a level finish under gravity | 2-24 hours before tiling (product dependent) | Large areas, full-room levelling |
| **Feather-edge/skim coat** | 0-5mm | Trowel applied. For thin corrections | 1-4 hours | Spot filling, localised corrections, smoothing |
| **High-build levelling** | 3-50mm+ (with aggregate) | Pour or trowel. For deeper corrections | 12-24 hours | Deep filling, major level corrections |

### 7.4 Major Australian Products

| Product | Manufacturer | Type | Thickness Range | Drying Time (Walkable) | Drying Time (Tile-Ready) | Approx. Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **ARDEX K15 Microtec** | ARDEX Australia | Self-levelling | Feather edge to 35mm (neat); to 50mm with aggregate | 2-3 hours | 16-18 hours | ~$78/20kg bag + GST |
| **ARDEX K301** | ARDEX Australia | Self-levelling (internal + external) | 2-20mm (neat); to 50mm with aggregate | 3-4 hours | 24 hours | ~$110/20kg bag + GST |
| **Mapei Ultraplan** | Mapei Australia | Self-levelling, ultra-quick | 1-15mm | ~3 hours | 12 hours (ceramic), 24 hours (vinyl) | ~$60-80/23kg bag |
| **Mapei Ultraplan Maxi** | Mapei Australia | Self-levelling, high-build | 3-40mm | ~3 hours | 12-24 hours | ~$70-90/23kg bag |
| **Mapei Novoplan 21** | Mapei Australia | Smoothing compound | 1-10mm | ~2 hours | 12 hours | ~$50-70/20kg bag |
| **Dunlop Multipurpose Floor Leveller** | Dunlop Trade | Self-levelling | 2-25mm | 2 hours | 4 hours (ceramic) | ~$30-50/15kg bag |
| **Dunlop LX-40** | Dunlop Trade | Self-levelling (dry areas) | 2-12mm | 2 hours | 4 hours | ~$25-40/20kg bag |
| **Dunlop Ardit Floor Leveller** | Dunlop Trade | Self-levelling (internal + external) | 2-50mm | 2-3 hours | 4-24 hours | ~$45-65/20kg bag |

**Coverage rate:** Approximately 1.5-1.7 kg/m2 per mm of thickness (varies by product). A 20kg bag covers approximately 6-7 m2 at 2mm thickness.

**Confidence:** HIGH for product specifications (from manufacturer datasheets). MEDIUM for pricing (indicative only, varies by supplier and region).

### 7.5 Substrate Preparation Before Levelling Compound

Levelling compound itself requires substrate preparation:

1. **Clean** -- Substrate must be clean, dry, and free of contaminants
2. **Prime** -- All substrates must be primed with a primer compatible with the levelling compound. Most manufacturers require their own primer (e.g., ARDEX P82 under ARDEX K15, Mapei Primer G under Mapei Ultraplan). Do not skip priming -- the compound will not bond without it
3. **Contain** -- Seal any gaps, cracks, or holes where the liquid compound could escape. Use foam strip or silicone to dam edges
4. **Temperature** -- Ambient and substrate temperature should be 5-35 degrees Celsius during application and curing

### 7.6 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Compound not bonding (lifts off substrate) | No primer applied; dusty or contaminated surface | Always prime. Always clean thoroughly before priming |
| Compound cracking | Applied too thick in single pour (exceeded max thickness); dried too fast | Follow maximum thickness per product. Protect from direct sun, wind, and heat during curing |
| Compound not self-levelling properly | Mixed too thick (insufficient water); not spread quickly enough | Follow manufacturer water ratios exactly. Spread within working time |
| Uneven finish | Floor not primed consistently; compound pooled in low areas beyond thickness limit | Prime evenly. Pour and spread systematically |

### 7.7 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Supply and apply self-levelling compound (ARDEX K15 or equivalent) to [X] m2 of floor area to achieve flatness tolerance of 3mm in 2m"
- "Feather-edge levelling compound to [describe area] to correct localised low spots"
- "Prime substrate prior to levelling compound application per manufacturer specifications"
- "Note: Levelling compound up to [X]mm average thickness included. Additional thickness beyond [X]mm will be subject to variation"
- "Allow [X] hours curing time for levelling compound before tiling commences"

**Cost impact:** Levelling compound is a significant cost item. At approximately $60-110 per 20kg bag and 1.5-1.7 kg/m2/mm coverage, a 10mm levelling layer on a 10m2 bathroom floor requires approximately 150-170 kg of product (7-9 bags) = $420-$990 in materials alone, plus labour.

## 8. Waterproofing Membrane (Tiler Interaction)

### 8.1 Critical Context

**The tiler does not apply the waterproofing membrane.** In Australian residential construction, waterproofing is a separate licensed trade. The waterproofer applies the membrane; the tiler tiles over it. However, the tiler has critical responsibilities to verify the membrane before tiling over it.

In some states (e.g., NSW), waterproofing requires a specific licence. In Victoria, the builder is responsible for ensuring compliance, and a Certificate of Compliance from the waterproofer is required.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 8.2 What the Tiler Must Check Before Tiling Over Waterproofing

| Check | Detail | Consequence of Failure |
|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Compliance certificate** | A signed Certificate of Compliance must be provided by the licensed waterproofer confirming work complies with AS 3740:2021 | No certificate = no tiling. Tiler should refuse to tile until certificate is provided |
| **Curing time** | Waterproofing membrane must be fully cured per manufacturer specification before tiling | Tiling over uncured membrane will compromise waterproofing integrity and adhesive bond |
| **Membrane integrity** | Visually inspect for cuts, tears, holes, thin spots, missed areas, or damage from other trades | Any damage must be repaired by the waterproofer before tiling |
| **Bond breakers** | Bond breakers (polyester strip/bandage) must be installed at all wall-wall and wall-floor junctions, around penetrations, and at movement joints | Missing bond breakers = membrane will crack at movement points |
| **Membrane type compatibility** | The tile adhesive must be compatible with the waterproofing membrane. Some adhesives do not bond well to certain membrane types | Check with adhesive manufacturer. Incompatible systems = adhesive failure |
| **Fall to waste** | In shower areas, verify that the screed under the membrane has correct fall to waste (minimum 1:80 per AS 3740 where no hob; 1:100 where hob controls water) | Incorrect fall = water pooling = long-term water damage |
| **Primer under adhesive** | Some waterproofing membranes require a primer between the membrane and the tile adhesive for proper bond | Check membrane manufacturer specifications. If primer is needed and not applied, adhesive will fail |
| **Flood test** | Ideally, the waterproofer should have performed a flood test (filling the wet area with water for 24 hours) before the tiler commences | Flood test identifies leaks before they are buried under tiles |

### 8.3 Membrane Curing Times

| Membrane Type | Typical Curing Time Before Tiling | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| **Liquid-applied (acrylic/polymer)** | 24-48 hours (2 coats, each coat 4-8 hours drying) | Most common in Australian residential. Must be tack-free and fully cured. Examples: Davco K10 Plus, Ardex WPM 300 |
| **Liquid-applied (fast-cure)** | 4-8 hours total | Fast-cure products exist but still require full manufacturer-specified curing before tiling |
| **Sheet membrane (polyethylene/PVC)** | Adhesive/primer cure time only (typically 24 hours) | Sheet is pre-cured. Wait time is for the bonding adhesive to cure |
| **Sheet membrane (self-adhesive)** | Often 24 hours after application | Per manufacturer specification |

### 8.4 Membrane Types the Tiler Will Encounter

| Type | Description | Tiling Adhesive Compatibility |
|------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Liquid-applied polymer/acrylic** (most common in AU) | Painted on in 2+ coats. Grey or blue/green when cured | Compatible with most cement-based and polymer-modified adhesives. May need primer in some systems |
| **Sheet membrane (polyethylene)** | Pre-formed sheet bonded to substrate | Requires polymer-modified adhesive. Check compatibility -- some sheet membranes are difficult for adhesive to bond to |
| **Cementitious membrane** | Cement-based waterproofing | Good adhesive compatibility (similar chemistry). Standard cement-based adhesives work |

### 8.5 AS 3740:2021 Key Requirements Relevant to Tiling

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Minimum fall to floor waste (no hob)** | 1:80 (12.5mm per metre) |
| **Minimum fall to floor waste (with hob)** | 1:100 (10mm per metre) |
| **Maximum fall to floor waste** | 1:50 (20mm per metre) |
| **Membrane extent -- shower floor** | Entire floor of shower recess |
| **Membrane extent -- shower walls** | Minimum 1800mm above finished floor level (full wall height in most cases) |
| **Membrane extent -- bathroom floor** | Varies by state; typically within 150mm of shower screen/hob for stepless shower, or entire wet area floor |
| **Membrane extent -- bathroom walls** | Around bath, above vanity, and any area likely to be subject to water splash |
| **Bond breakers** | Required at all internal corners (wall-wall, wall-floor), around all penetrations, and at any control/movement joints |

### 8.6 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Note: Waterproofing of wet areas is by licensed waterproofer -- NOT included in tiling scope"
- "Tiler to verify waterproofing membrane is fully cured, intact, and a Certificate of Compliance has been issued before commencing tiling"
- "Tiler to visually inspect waterproofing membrane for damage, cuts, thin spots, or missed areas. Any defects to be reported to waterproofer for rectification before tiling"
- "Tiler to verify correct fall to waste in shower area before tiling (minimum 1:80 where no hob)"
- "Tiler to confirm adhesive compatibility with waterproofing membrane system"
- "EXCLUSION: Any waterproofing rectification or repair work is excluded from this tiling scope"

---

## 9. Screed

### 9.1 What It Is

Screed is a cementitious layer applied to a substrate to create a smooth, flat, and correctly graded surface for tiling. In renovation tiling, screed is most commonly required for shower floors (to create fall to waste) and for levelling uneven floor substrates beyond what levelling compound can handle.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 9.2 When Screed Is Required

| Situation | Screed Required? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Shower floor (to create fall to waste)** | Almost always YES | Fall must be 1:80 minimum (no hob) or 1:100 (with hob) to floor waste per AS 3740 |
| **Floor levelling (large deviations)** | YES if deviation exceeds levelling compound limits (typically >40mm) | Screed for bulk levelling; levelling compound for final finish |
| **New floor where no slab exists** | YES -- structural screed | Typically over insulation or membranes. Not common in renovation |
| **Flat concrete slab in bathroom** | Usually NO for floor; YES for shower base | Slab usually has correct level; shower base needs fall formed |

### 9.3 Types of Screed

#### Sand-Cement Screed (Traditional)

| Property | Specification |
|----------|--------------|
| **Mix ratio** | 4 parts sharp sand : 1 part cement (4:1) |
| **Water content** | Mixed to "damp sand" or "wet beach sand" consistency. NOT sloppy |
| **Minimum thickness (bonded)** | 25mm |
| **Minimum thickness (unbonded)** | 40mm |
| **Maximum thickness** | 75-100mm (beyond this, consider structural fill or lightweight fill) |
| **Curing time** | Minimum 7 days; ideally 28 days before tiling |
| **Fall formation** | Screed is hand-trowelled to create falls to waste in shower areas |
| **Cost** | Low material cost (~$10-15/m2 for materials). Labour-intensive |

#### Proprietary Rapid-Set Screed

| Product | Manufacturer | Thickness Range | Walkable | Tile-Ready | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|------------|-------|
| **ARDEX A38** | ARDEX Australia | 20-90mm (with aggregate) | 2-3 hours | 4-16 hours (depending on thickness) | Rapid set. Ideal for shower base screed |
| **ARDEX A46** | ARDEX Australia | Feather edge to 20mm | 45 minutes | 2-3 hours | Slump-free mortar. Excellent for forming falls and patching |
| **Easy Mix Traditional Floor Screed** | Easy Mix | 25-75mm | 24 hours | 7 days | Pre-mixed sand-cement screed. Just add water |

### 9.4 Shower Floor Fall Requirements

| Configuration | Minimum Fall | Maximum Fall | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Shower with hob (stepped entry)** | 1:100 (10mm per metre) | 1:50 (20mm per metre) | Hob contains water; less steep fall acceptable |
| **Hobless/stepless shower** | 1:80 (12.5mm per metre) | 1:50 (20mm per metre) | No hob = water can escape. Steeper fall required |
| **General bathroom floor (to floor waste)** | 1:100 minimum | 1:50 maximum | Where a floor waste is installed |

**Example calculation:** For a 900mm x 900mm shower with centre waste, the furthest point from the waste is approximately 640mm (corner to centre). At 1:80 fall, the screed at the wall must be 8mm higher than the waste. At 1:50 fall, it must be 13mm higher.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Sourced from AS 3740:2021.

### 9.5 Screed in the Tiling Scope

**Who does the screed?** This varies:

| Scenario | Typically Done By | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Shower base screed (fall to waste) | **Tiler or builder** | Many tilers include shower base screeding in their scope. Some builders have the waterproofer or a labourer do it |
| General floor levelling screed | **Builder or concreter** | Larger screeding jobs are typically not the tiler's responsibility |
| Levelling compound (thin) | **Tiler** | Thin levelling (under ~10mm) is commonly part of the tiling scope |

**Important:** The scope document must clearly state who is responsible for screeding. This is a common source of disputes -- the tiler assumes the builder will provide a flat substrate, and the builder assumes the tiler will screed.

### 9.6 Preparation Steps (Sand-Cement Screed for Shower Floor)

1. **Ensure substrate is clean and sound** -- Remove any loose material, dust, contaminants
2. **Install screed mesh** (if specified) -- Galvanised wire mesh for reinforcement in thicker screeds
3. **Set datum points** -- Establish the finished floor level at the waste and at the walls/hob, calculating the required fall
4. **Dampen substrate** -- Lightly wet the concrete or fibre cement substrate (but not pooling water) to prevent it drawing moisture from the screed too quickly
5. **Apply bonding agent** (if bonded screed) -- Slurry coat of cement and water, or proprietary bonding agent
6. **Place and compact screed** -- Place sand-cement mix and compact firmly with a flat trowel. Work from walls towards waste, forming the required fall
7. **Trowel to finish** -- Smooth with a flat steel trowel. The surface should be flat and true within each fall plane
8. **Cure** -- Keep damp for minimum 3 days. Do not let screed dry out too fast (cover with plastic sheeting in hot weather)
9. **Wait** -- Minimum 7 days before waterproofing membrane application; 28 days is preferred for full cure

### 9.7 Common Problems

| Problem | Cause | Prevention |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Screed cracking | Dried too fast; too thin; no bonding to substrate | Cure properly (keep damp). Minimum 25mm bonded, 40mm unbonded. Apply bonding agent |
| Water pooling in shower | Insufficient fall; fall not uniform | Calculate and set datum points precisely. Check with spirit level during application |
| Screed debonding from substrate | No bonding agent; substrate was dusty or dry | Always apply bonding slurry. Dampen substrate. Clean thoroughly |
| Screed too rough for tiling | Poor trowel finish | Finish with flat steel trowel. If too rough, apply thin levelling compound over cured screed |

### 9.8 How It Appears in a Scope Document

**Typical scope line items:**

- "Supply and apply sand-cement screed to shower floor to form fall to waste at 1:80 minimum. Average screed thickness [X]mm"
- "Supply and apply rapid-set screed (ARDEX A38 or equivalent) to shower base to form fall to waste"
- "Note: Screed must cure for minimum [7/28] days before waterproofing membrane is applied by waterproofer"
- "EXCLUSION: General floor levelling screed beyond shower area is excluded from tiling scope -- by builder"

**OR if tiler is NOT doing screed:**

- "Note: Builder to provide shower base screed with fall to waste at minimum 1:80 before waterproofer attends. Tiler to verify fall before tiling"

| **Levelling compound** | YES (once cured) | NO (not a wall substrate) | YES (if over waterproofing) | No practical limit | LOW (follow SLC manufacturers instructions) | YES (under the levelling compound) |
| **Screed** | YES (once cured) | NO | YES (waterproofing goes over screed) | No practical limit | MEDIUM | YES |
| **Waterproofing membrane** | YES (tile over it) | YES (tile over it) | YES (this IS the waterproofing) | N/A | LOW (verify, don't prepare) | Check manufacturer requirements |

## 11. Common Defects Caused by Poor Substrate Preparation

These are the most common tiling defects in Australian residential renovation, all traceable to substrate preparation failures:

### 11.1 Drummy Tiles (Hollow Sounding)

**What it is:** Tiles that produce a hollow/drumming sound when tapped, indicating a void between the tile and the substrate.

**Causes:**
- Dusty or contaminated substrate (adhesive bonded to dust, not substrate)
- Substrate not primed (adhesive dried too fast, poor bond)
- Adhesive skinned over before tile placement (too much open time)
- Insufficient adhesive coverage (less than 80% for internal floors, 90% for wet area walls per AS 3958)
- Wrong adhesive type for the substrate

**AS 3958 requirement:** Minimum 80% adhesive contact coverage for internal floor tiles; 90% for external floor tiles and wet area wall tiling. Achieved with a 3-4mm finished adhesive bed thickness.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 11.2 Tile Cracking

**Causes:**
- Structural crack in substrate propagating through tiles (no crack isolation)
- Tiling directly on timber without separation layer
- Substrate movement (differential movement between tile and substrate)
- No movement joints installed where required
- Tiles too thin for the application

### 11.3 Lippage (Uneven Tile Edges)

**Causes:**
- Substrate not flat to tolerance
- Adhesive bed thickness varies across installation
- Large format tiles without levelling clips
- Screed or levelling compound unevenly applied

### 11.4 Efflorescence (White Salt Staining)

**Causes:**
- Excessive moisture in concrete slab migrating through tiles
- Tiling before slab adequately cured (less than 6 weeks)
- No moisture barrier under slab-on-ground construction

### 11.5 Adhesion Failure (Tiles Falling Off Walls)

**Causes:**
- Tile weight exceeds plasterboard limit (32 kg/m2)
- No primer on substrate
- Wrong adhesive type (e.g., standard cement adhesive on non-porous substrate)
- Tiling over uncured waterproofing membrane
- Substrate contaminated (paint, oil, grease, silicone)

---

## 12. Scope Document Language Guide

### 12.1 Standard Scope Phrases for Substrate Preparation

**For substrate verification (tiler's responsibility):**
- "Inspect and verify substrate is sound, flat to tolerance, and suitable for tiling prior to commencing work"
- "Report any substrate deficiencies to client/builder for rectification prior to tiling"
- "Verify waterproofing membrane is cured, intact, and certified before tiling wet areas"

**For substrate preparation work (by tiler):**
- "Prepare substrate for tiling: clean, prime, and ensure surface is free of contaminants"
- "Mechanically prepare concrete floor using diamond cup grinder to create adhesion profile"
- "Supply and apply levelling compound to achieve flatness tolerance of 3mm in 2m"
- "Supply and apply sand-cement screed to shower floor to form fall to waste at minimum 1:80"

- "PROVISIONAL: Repair of [X] drummy tiles in existing substrate before tile-on-tile installation"
- "PROVISIONAL: Additional screed thickness if existing levels are not as surveyed"

### 12.2 Items That Must Be Specified in Every Tiling Scope

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Substrate type** | Different substrates require different preparation, primers, and adhesives |
| **Substrate preparation method** | Grinding, cleaning, priming -- be specific |
| **Primer product or type** | "Compatible primer" at minimum; specific product name preferred |
| **Adhesive type** | Cement-based, polymer-modified, etc. Must match substrate |
| **Who is responsible for substrate** | Builder provides substrate; tiler verifies and primes |
| **Levelling compound** (if applicable) | Area, approximate thickness, product |
| **Screed** (if applicable) | Area, fall specification, who is responsible |
| **Waterproofing verification** | Tiler's responsibility to check, not apply |
