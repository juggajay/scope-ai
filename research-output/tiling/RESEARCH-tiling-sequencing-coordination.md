## 1. Overview: Where Tiling Sits in the Renovation Sequence

Tiling is a mid-stage trade in any residential renovation. It sits after the concealed structural and services work is complete and before the visible fixtures and fittings are installed. The tiler's work is permanent and difficult to change once done, which makes correct sequencing critical.

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 1.1 The General Renovation Sequence

```
RENOVATION TIMELINE — TILING POSITION
========================================

  EARLY TRADES               TILING WINDOW                  POST-TILING TRADES
  ─────────────         ──────────────────────         ─────────────────────────
  Demolition        →   Substrate preparation      →   Cabinetry installation
  Structural work       (screeding, levelling)          Stone benchtop install
  Framing           →   TILING                     →   Plumber fit-off (2nd fix)
  Plumbing rough-in     (walls first, then floor)       Electrician fit-off
  Electrical rough-in                                   Shower screen install
  Waterproofing                                         Painting (final coat)
  (Floor heating mat                                    Fixtures & accessories
   install — if applicable)                             Silicone & sealant
```

### 1.2 Why Tiling Is Sequencing-Critical

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Permanent installation** | Tiles are adhered to substrates with cement-based or epoxy adhesive. Removing them to fix errors damages waterproofing membranes, plasterboard, and screeds. Rectification is expensive and time-consuming. |
| **Dependency on concealed work** | All pipes, wires, and waterproofing must be in their final positions before tiles cover them. Moving a pipe after tiling means removing tiles, re-waterproofing, and re-tiling. |
| **Downstream trade dependency** | Shower screens, vanities, toilets, tapware, and benchtops all rely on tiling being finished, flat, plumb, and at the correct level. |
| **Curing time requirements** | Adhesive must cure before grouting (24 hours minimum). Grout must cure before water exposure (72+ hours). These wait times affect the overall project timeline. |
| **Layout precision** | Tile layout must account for floor waste positions, fixture locations, niches, and feature walls. This requires coordination with plumber, electrician, and cabinetmaker BEFORE tiling starts. |

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 2. Pre-Tiling Requirements

Everything in this section must be 100% complete and verified before the tiler begins work.

### 2.1 Waterproofing — Certified and Cured

| Requirement | Detail | Confidence |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Waterproofing membrane applied** | All wet areas (bathrooms, showers, laundries, and any area required by AS 3740:2021) must have waterproofing membrane applied and fully cured before tiling | HIGH |
| **Curing time met** | Minimum curing time depends on product: rapid-cure products (e.g., Crommelin Rapid Re-coat) allow tiling in 4 hours; standard products (e.g., Davco K10 Plus) require minimum 6 hours; some products require 24-48 hours. Always follow manufacturer specifications | HIGH |
| **Waterproofing certificate issued** | A licensed waterproofer must issue a compliance certificate before tiling can commence in wet areas. This is a legal requirement in all Australian states | HIGH |
| **Inspection completed** | Waterproofing must be inspected before tiles are applied. Once tiles are laid, defects cannot be identified without destructive investigation | HIGH |
| **Flood test passed (if required)** | Some builders and certifiers require a flood test (plugging shower waste, filling with water, and monitoring for 24 hours) before tiling approval is given | MEDIUM |

#### Who Issues the Waterproofing Certificate?

| State | Regulatory Body | Licence Requirement |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **NSW** | Office of Fair Trading | Contractor licence required for waterproofing work valued over $5,000 (incl. GST). Licensed waterproofer issues the compliance certificate |
| **VIC** | Victorian Building Authority (VBA) | Licence required for work valued over $5,000 (incl. GST). Licensed waterproofer issues certificate |
| **QLD** | Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC) | Licence required for work valued over $3,300 (incl. GST). Licensed waterproofer issues certificate |
| **SA** | Consumer and Business Services | Licensed waterproofer issues certificate |
| **WA** | Building Services Board | Licensed waterproofer issues certificate |

**Confidence: HIGH** — Waterproofing licensing requirements are legislated in each state.

#### What Happens If the Tiler Damages the Waterproofing Membrane?

This is one of the most costly sequencing failures in Australian renovations:

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tiler punctures membrane with tools** | Membrane must be repaired by the licensed waterproofer. Repair may void the original warranty if not done by the original applicator |
| **Tiler uses inappropriate adhesive** | Some adhesives are incompatible with certain membranes. Can cause delamination or membrane breakdown. Tiler must confirm adhesive compatibility with waterproofing product before starting |
| **Damage discovered after tiling** | Tiles must be removed, membrane repaired or completely re-applied, and tiles re-laid. Cost can be $3,000-$10,000+ depending on extent |
| **Who pays?** | If it can be proven that the tiler caused the damage, the tiler bears the cost. If the membrane was defective, the waterproofer bears the cost. In practice, disputes are common — this is why inspection before tiling is essential |
| **Prevention** | Tiler must walk the waterproofed area carefully before starting. Any visible damage must be reported to the builder/waterproofer and repaired before tiling commences. Tiler should avoid using sharp tools directly on membrane surface and use protective sheeting when staging materials |

**Confidence: HIGH** — Confirmed across multiple Australian builder forums and waterproofing industry publications.

### 2.2 Plumbing Rough-In Complete

| Requirement | Detail | Confidence |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| **All pipe positions finalised** | Hot/cold water supply, drainage, and gas pipes must be in their final concealed positions within walls and floors | HIGH |
| **Floor waste installed** | Floor waste body and puddle flange installed at the correct height and position. This determines the tile layout and fall direction for the entire floor | HIGH |
| **Shower waste installed** | Shower waste set at the correct height to allow fall from the furthest shower wall to the waste (minimum 1:80 gradient for standard showers, 1:100 for hob/screen-separated showers per NCC) | HIGH |
| **Niche plumbing signed off** | If shower niches are included, all plumbing (mixer valves, shower head outlets) positions must be finalised and marked on the wall before tiling | HIGH |
| **Bath waste and overflow positioned** | If a freestanding or built-in bath is included, waste and overflow positions must be set before tiling the surrounding area | HIGH |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 2.3 Electrical Rough-In Complete

| Requirement | Detail | Confidence |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| **All cable positions finalised** | Electrical cables for power points, lighting, exhaust fans, and heated towel rails must be in their final concealed positions | HIGH |
| **Floor heating mats installed** | If electric underfloor heating is specified, the electrician installs the heating mat/cable BEFORE the tiler starts floor tiling. The tiler tiles directly over the heating mat. The electrician returns after tiling to connect the thermostat | HIGH |
| **Power point positions marked** | All power point and switch positions on walls that will be tiled must be marked and boxes installed before tiling. The tiler cuts tiles around these positions | HIGH |
| **Niche lighting wired** | If a lit shower niche is specified, the electrician must have wiring in place before the niche is tiled | HIGH |
| **Exhaust fan position set** | Ceiling exhaust fan position and ducting must be finalised (not tiling-related, but affects ceiling work that precedes tiling) | MEDIUM |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 2.4 Substrate Preparation

| Requirement | Detail | Confidence |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Floor screed to falls** | In wet areas, the floor screed must be laid with the correct fall gradient toward the floor waste BEFORE waterproofing and tiling. The screed provides the slope; the tile follows it | HIGH |
| **Wall substrate flat and plumb** | Walls must be flat within 5mm over 3 metres (interior) per AS 3958.1. Plasterboard or cement sheet must be secure, flat, and free from bows or bulges | HIGH |
| **Levelling compound applied (if needed)** | Where existing floors have irregularities greater than 5mm over 3m, a self-levelling compound must be applied and cured (typically 24 hours) before tiling | HIGH |
| **Cement sheet in wet areas** | Villaboard or equivalent cement sheet (not standard plasterboard) must be used in wet area walls behind tiles. This is an NCC requirement for wet areas | HIGH |
| **Primer applied** | Substrate primer applied to improve adhesive bond. Particularly important on concrete, cement sheet, and plasterboard. Priming is a one-day task that must dry before tiling begins | HIGH |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.5 Floor Heating Mat Coordination (If Applicable)

The coordination between electrician, tiler, and floor heating system is one of the most important multi-trade sequences in a bathroom renovation.

```
FLOOR HEATING INSTALLATION SEQUENCE
=====================================

1. ELECTRICIAN    →  Installs heating mat/cable on prepared substrate
                     Tests mat resistance (must match manufacturer spec)
                     Photographs mat layout for records
                     Issues interim compliance note

2. TILER          →  Tiles directly over heating mat
                     Uses flexible tile adhesive (mandatory — to accommodate thermal expansion)
                     Takes extra care with trowel to avoid cutting heating cables
                     Must NOT use screed nails, sharp tools, or heavy staging on mat

3. ELECTRICIAN    →  Returns AFTER tiling is complete
   (return visit)    Connects thermostat
                     Tests system
                     Issues Certificate of Compliance (COC)

4. WAITING PERIOD →  Floor heating must NOT be turned on for minimum 28 days
                     after tiling (to allow full adhesive and grout cure)
```

| Critical Rule | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Mat must be tested before tiling** | Electrician tests resistance before and after mat is laid. If mat is damaged during tiling, it cannot be repaired without removing tiles |
| **Flexible adhesive required** | Standard cement adhesive will crack with thermal cycling. Flexible (polymer-modified) adhesive is mandatory over floor heating |
| **No screed over mat** | Thin heating mats are designed to be tiled directly over — no additional screed. Thick cable systems may require a thin screed layer first |
| **Do not turn on for 28 days** | Premature heating will crack adhesive and grout before it has fully cured |

**Confidence: HIGH** — Confirmed by Hotwire Heating Australia, Comfort Heat Australia, and Beaumont Tiles installation guides.

## 3. Tiling Sequence by Area

### 3.1 Bathroom — Full Renovation

The bathroom is the most complex tiling scenario because it involves both wall and floor tiling, wet area requirements, and coordination with the most other trades.

**Confidence: HIGH**

```
BATHROOM TILING SEQUENCE
=========================

Step 1: WALL TILING (start here)
  - Tile all walls from the second row up (leave bottom row for last)
  - Tile shower walls, including niche (if applicable)
  - Tile feature walls
  - Cut tiles around plumbing penetrations (mixer valves, shower outlets)
  - Cut tiles around electrical positions (power points, niche lights)
  - Install tile trim profiles at exposed edges

Step 2: FLOOR TILING
  - Lay floor tiles with correct fall to floor waste
  - Set tiles around floor waste grate
  - Ensure even, lippage-free finish (especially at shower entry)
  - If floor heating installed, use flexible adhesive

Step 3: BOTTOM ROW OF WALL TILES
  - Install the bottom row of wall tiles last
  - This row overlaps the floor tile edge, creating a clean junction
  - Prevents water tracking behind the wall tile at floor level

Step 4: GROUTING (after adhesive cures — minimum 24 hours)
  - Grout all wall and floor tile joints
  - Clean excess grout immediately

Step 5: SILICONE JUNCTIONS
  - Apply silicone (NOT grout) at all change-of-plane junctions:
    - Wall-to-floor junction
    - Internal corner junctions (wall-to-wall)
    - Around floor waste
    - Around any penetrations
  - Use neutral-cure, sanitary-grade, mould-resistant silicone
  - Colour-match to grout where possible

Step 6: SEALING (if applicable)
  - Natural stone tiles and some porcelain require sealing after grouting
  - Sealer must be applied before the bathroom is used
```

### 3.2 Kitchen — Splashback Only

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Cabinets installed and level | Splashback height determined by gap between benchtop level and overhead cabinets |
| 2 | Electrician installs power points in splashback zone | Must be done before tiling covers the wall |
| 3 | Tile splashback from overhead cabinets down to benchtop line | Use a temporary batten/straight edge at benchtop height as a guide for the bottom tile row |
| 4 | Grout after 24-hour adhesive cure | Standard grouting process |
| 5 | Stone benchtop installed | Top surface meets bottom of tiles — clean junction |
| 6 | Silicone at tile-to-benchtop junction | Neutral cure, colour-matched, sanitary-grade |

**Confidence: HIGH** — See also Section 9 for detailed splashback sequencing analysis.

### 3.3 Kitchen — Floor Tiling

See Section 8 for the detailed analysis of whether to tile under cabinets or up to cabinets.

### 3.4 Laundry

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Plumbing rough-in complete (washing machine taps, tub waste, floor waste) | All positions finalised |
| 2 | Waterproofing complete and certified (if required — laundries in some states require waterproofing per AS 3740) | Check state-specific requirements |
| 3 | Wall tiling (typically splashback behind tub/bench only) | Height varies — commonly 900mm-1200mm from floor, or full-height behind shower if combined laundry/bathroom |
| 4 | Floor tiling | Fall to floor waste if wet area |
| 5 | Grouting and silicone | Standard process |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 3.5 Living Areas — Floor Tiling Only

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | All concealed services (plumbing/electrical) complete | Floor tiling covers everything |
| 2 | Substrate preparation (levelling compound if required) | Must be flat within 5mm over 3m |
| 3 | Floor tiling | Typically large-format tiles (600x600mm or larger) in open-plan living areas |
| 4 | Grouting | Standard process |
| 5 | Protective covering applied | Cardboard or similar protection if other trades still working in the space |

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 3.6 Outdoor Areas

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Structural slab complete and cured (minimum 28 days for new concrete) | Outdoor tiles are typically adhered to concrete slabs |
| 2 | Waterproofing complete (if over habitable space below, e.g., balcony over living area) | Required by NCC for external decks/balconies over enclosed spaces |
| 3 | Screed to falls (minimum 1:100 for outdoor areas) | Water must drain away from building |
| 4 | Tile with appropriate outdoor-rated adhesive | Must be flexible to accommodate thermal expansion. Outdoor adhesive must be frost-resistant in applicable areas |
| 5 | Grout with outdoor-rated grout | Standard cement grout will crack outdoors — use flexible, weather-resistant grout |
| 6 | Seal if required | Most outdoor porcelain does not require sealing; natural stone does |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

## 4. Coordination with Other Trades

### 4.1 Waterproofer

**Why coordination matters:** The waterproofing membrane is the last line of defence against water damage to the building structure. Tiling sits directly on top of the membrane in wet areas. If the tiler starts before waterproofing is properly certified, any membrane defects will be permanently concealed. If the tiler damages the membrane during installation, the consequences range from a simple repair (best case) to a complete strip-out and re-do (worst case).

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Waterproofing must be certified before tiling starts** | Licensed waterproofer issues a compliance certificate confirming the membrane meets AS 3740:2021. Building certifier may also inspect | If tiling proceeds without certification and a leak develops later, the homeowner has no warranty claim. Insurance may not cover remediation. Council may issue a compliance order |
| **Minimum curing time must be met** | Rapid-cure: 4 hours. Standard: 6-24 hours. Some products: 48 hours. Always per manufacturer specification | Tiling on uncured membrane can cause adhesive failure, membrane puncture, or chemical incompatibility between membrane and adhesive |
| **Adhesive compatibility confirmed** | Tiler must confirm that the tile adhesive is compatible with the specific waterproofing membrane product used | Some adhesive-membrane combinations cause delamination. Major brands (Davco, Sika, Ardex) publish compatibility charts |
| **Membrane damage protocol agreed** | Before tiling starts, builder should confirm the procedure if the tiler discovers or causes membrane damage | Without a pre-agreed protocol, membrane damage may be concealed, leading to catastrophic water damage discovered months or years later |
| **Floor waste puddle flange height** | Waterproofer bonds the membrane into the floor waste puddle flange. The height relationship between membrane, screed, and tile must be coordinated | If the puddle flange is too high or too low relative to the finished tile level, water will not drain correctly or will pool around the waste |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 4.2 Plumber

**Why coordination matters:** The plumber determines the positions of every water-related element that the tiler must work around. Floor waste position dictates the entire floor tile layout. Shower mixer position determines where pattern breaks occur in wall tiles. Bath waste position affects tile set-out around the bath.

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Floor waste position determines tile layout** | The floor waste is the lowest point. All floor tiles must slope toward it. The tile layout (starting point, cut positions) is built around the waste position. Maximum tile size in a wet area with falls is 300x300mm for standard point wastes (larger tiles cannot accommodate the fall without lippage) | If the tiler starts laying floor tiles without knowing the exact waste position, tiles may not fall correctly to the drain. Water pools, doesn't drain, and causes long-term damage. Lippage at tile edges creates trip hazards |
| **Linear drain position** | Linear (channel) drains allow larger tiles because the fall is in one direction only. The plumber must position the linear drain where agreed, and the tiler lays tiles falling in a single plane toward it | If the linear drain is not level or not at the agreed position, the single-direction fall will not work. Tiles must be re-laid |
| **Shower mixer valve position** | The mixer valve penetration creates a break in the tile pattern. The tiler needs this position marked to plan the tile layout so the penetration falls in the centre of a tile (not on a grout joint) where possible | Penetration landing on a grout joint looks unprofessional and is harder to waterproof. Penetration off-centre of a tile requires an asymmetric cut that may not look intentional |
| **Shower head outlet height** | The shower arm exits through the wall tile. Height must be agreed between plumber, homeowner, and tiler | If the height changes after tiling, a new hole must be drilled through the tile and waterproofing — compromising the membrane |
| **Niche position** | Shower niche dimensions and position must be agreed with plumber (to avoid pipe locations) and tiler (to align with tile module so full tiles frame the niche opening) | Niche that does not align with tile grid requires excessive cutting, looks unprofessional, and may compromise waterproofing at complex junctions |
| **Toilet set-out** | The toilet waste pipe set-out distance (typically 140mm, 165mm, or 200mm from wall to pipe centre) must be confirmed. The floor tile is cut around this pipe | If the tiler doesn't know the exact set-out, the cut may be wrong, requiring tile replacement. Worse, if the toilet is selected after tiling, the set-out may not match |
| **Bath waste and overflow** | For built-in baths, the plumber sets waste and overflow positions before tiling the bath surrounds | If tiling proceeds before bath plumbing is finalised, tiles may need to be removed to access plumbing |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 4.3 Electrician

**Why coordination matters:** The electrician installs elements both within and on tiled surfaces. Floor heating mats must be installed before floor tiling. Power points and switches on tiled walls require precise positioning. The tiler cuts around all electrical elements.

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Floor heating mat installed before floor tiling** | Electrician installs and tests heating mat. Tiler tiles over it with flexible adhesive. Electrician returns after tiling to connect thermostat | If the electrician has not installed the mat before the tiler starts, either tiling is delayed or the mat cannot be installed. Retrofitting floor heating after tiling requires complete floor tile removal |
| **Floor heating mat tested before AND after tiling** | Electrician measures cable resistance before tiling (baseline) and after tiling (to detect damage). If resistance changes, a cable has been damaged during tiling | If testing is not done before tiling, there is no baseline to detect damage. A damaged cable discovered after tiling means the entire floor must be removed |
| **Power point positions on tiled walls** | Electrician installs mounting boxes flush with the tile face. Position must be confirmed before tiling so the tiler can plan tile layout around the power point | Power point that falls across a tile joint looks unprofessional. Position that is wrong by even 10mm may mean a tile must be re-cut or replaced |
| **Niche lighting** | If a lit shower niche is specified, the electrician must have wiring in place and any LED strip or fitting position confirmed before the tiler tiles the niche | Wiring cannot be run after the niche is tiled without destructive work |
| **Exhaust fan ceiling penetration** | Fan position confirmed before ceiling plaster and any ceiling tiling (rare in residential, but occurs in some designs) | Minor impact on tiling — mainly affects sequencing of other trades |
| **Heated towel rail wiring** | If hardwired (not plug-in), wiring position must be confirmed before wall tiling | A hardwired towel rail that needs a different cable position after tiling requires tile removal and membrane repair |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 4.4 Cabinet Maker

**Why coordination matters:** The relationship between tiling and cabinetry is bidirectional. Floor tiling may need to happen before or after cabinets (see Section 8). Splashback tiling always happens after cabinets are installed (because splashback height is determined by the gap between benchtop and overheads). The cabinet maker must provide final dimensions to the tiler.

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Splashback height confirmed** | Typically 600mm between benchtop surface and bottom of overhead cabinets. This dimension determines the tile layout for the splashback | If the tiler starts the splashback before cabinets are installed, and the final cabinet height differs from the plan, the splashback may be too tall or too short. Tiles may need to be cut at awkward heights |
| **Cabinet dimensions provided to tiler** | The tiler needs the exact height of the benchtop from the floor (typically 900mm) and the height of the overhead cabinets from the floor to plan splashback tile layout | Without exact dimensions, the tiler cannot accurately plan where the first and last rows of splashback tiles will fall |
| **End panel positions** | Where cabinets end and tiled wall continues, the junction must be planned. The tiler needs to know where cabinet end panels finish | If not coordinated, there may be a visible gap or misalignment between the cabinet end panel and the adjacent tile |
| **Vanity dimensions (bathroom)** | The tiler needs to know the exact width, depth, and height of the bathroom vanity to plan wall tile layout and floor tile extent behind/around the vanity | A vanity that does not fit the tiled space requires on-site tile modifications |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 4.5 Stone Mason (Benchtop Installer)

**Why coordination matters:** The junction between a tiled splashback and a stone benchtop is one of the most visible details in any kitchen renovation. The installation order determines the quality of this junction. Getting it wrong is the single most common sequencing error in Australian kitchen renovations.

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Splashback tiles installed BEFORE stone benchtop** | The correct sequence is: cabinets installed, splashback tiled during the stone fabrication window, then stone benchtop installed to butt up against the bottom of the tiles | If the stone benchtop is installed first and tiles are then laid on top of the stone, there is a visible silicone line between tile and stone. This line is prone to mould, looks unprofessional, and makes future tile replacement difficult without damaging the stone |
| **Tiler uses temporary batten at benchtop height** | During splashback tiling, the tiler screws a temporary timber batten to the wall at the exact height where the benchtop surface will sit. The bottom row of tiles rests on this batten. After adhesive cures, the batten is removed, and the stone is installed underneath | If the tiler does not have the correct benchtop height (from the cabinet maker or stone mason), the batten may be at the wrong height, leaving a gap or overlap when the stone is installed |
| **Silicone junction between tile and stone** | After the stone benchtop is installed, a bead of colour-matched, neutral-cure, sanitary-grade silicone is applied at the tile-to-stone junction. This is a flexible joint that accommodates minor movement | If grout (not silicone) is used at this junction, it will crack as the stone and wall move independently. Cracked grout allows water behind the tile |
| **Stone splashback alternative** | If the splashback is stone (not tile), the stone mason templates and fabricates both benchtop and splashback together. Tiler is not involved in the splashback area | Tiler must know which sections of the wall they are responsible for, and which sections the stone mason will cover |

**Confidence: HIGH** — This is confirmed as the most debated sequencing question in Australian kitchen renovations. The "tile first, then stone" approach is the industry-recommended best practice. See also the ScopeAI stone-benchtop research for the other side of this coordination.

---

### 4.6 Painter

**Why coordination matters:** Tiling and painting must be carefully sequenced to avoid damage to either trade's work. The standard approach is: primer and first coat before tiling, final coat and touch-ups after tiling.

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Primer and first coat BEFORE tiling** | Painter applies primer and first coat to walls and ceilings before tiling begins. This gives a base coat that the tiler can work around | If painting is not started before tiling, the painter must work carefully around finished tiles, increasing time and risk of paint on tile faces |
| **Final coat AFTER tiling** | After tiling and grouting are complete, the painter returns for the final coat and touch-ups. This covers any marks, adhesive residue, or damage from the tiling process | If the final coat is applied before tiling, the tiler will inevitably mark, scratch, or splatter adhesive/grout on the painted surfaces. The painter must return anyway |
| **Tiler protects painted surfaces** | If any painting has been done before tiling starts, the tiler must protect those surfaces with drop sheets and masking | Grout and adhesive stains on finished paint are difficult to remove without damaging the paint finish |
| **Silicone colour matching** | Where tile meets painted wall (e.g., at the top of a splashback or at the edge of a tiled feature wall), the silicone colour should complement both the grout and the paint colour | If silicone is applied before the final paint colour is confirmed, the colour match may be wrong |

**Confidence: HIGH**

---

### 4.7 Glazier (Shower Screen Installer)

**Why coordination matters:** The shower screen is one of the last items installed in a bathroom renovation. It sits on top of the finished floor tile and is fixed to the finished wall tile. The quality of the tiling at the screen location directly determines whether the screen fits correctly and whether it is watertight.

| Coordination Point | Detail | What Goes Wrong If Missed |
|--------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Shower screen installed AFTER all wall and floor tiling is complete** | The glazier measures for the shower screen after tiling is finished. Final measurements can only be taken once tile thickness is accounted for | If the glazier measures before tiling, the measurements will be wrong by the tile + adhesive thickness (typically 10-15mm). The screen will not fit |
| **Tile must be flat and plumb at screen fixing locations** | Where the shower screen glass panel or channel meets the wall, the tile surface must be perfectly flat and plumb. Frameless screens are particularly sensitive — even 2-3mm of bow in the wall tile will result in a visible gap between glass and tile | If wall tiles are not flat at the screen location, the screen will have visible gaps that leak water. The glazier may refuse to install until the tiling is corrected |
| **Full adhesive bed behind tiles at screen fixing points** | Where the screen bracket screws are fixed through the tile into the wall, the tile must have a full bed of adhesive behind it (not spot-fixed). Tightening bracket screws into a spot-fixed tile will crack the tile | If the tiler has spot-fixed tiles (using dobs of adhesive rather than full coverage) at screen fixing locations, the tile will crack when the glazier drills and fixes brackets. Cracked tile must be replaced |
| **Timber blocking in wall frame at hinge/channel locations** | For heavy frameless screens with wall-mounted hinges, the wall frame must have solid timber blocking (minimum 100mm wide, full height of glass) behind the plasterboard/cement sheet at the hinge location | If blocking is not installed during framing (before plasterboard and tiling), the hinge screws will pull through plasterboard under the weight of the glass. The wall must be opened, blocking installed, re-sheeted, re-waterproofed, and re-tiled |
| **Tile edge treatment at screen-to-tile junction** | The exposed tile edge where it meets the shower screen should have a tile trim profile or a clean bullnose edge. Raw cut tile edges are not acceptable at this visible junction | Poor edge treatment at the screen junction looks amateur and may have sharp edges that are a safety concern |

## 6. Curing, Drying, and Waiting Periods

These waiting periods are mandatory and directly affect the project timeline. Skipping them leads to tile failure, cracked grout, and adhesive delamination.

### 6.1 Adhesive Curing Before Grouting

| Adhesive Type | Minimum Cure Before Grouting | Recommended Cure | Notes | Confidence |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| **Standard cement-based adhesive** | 24 hours | 48 hours | At 22 degrees C, 50% RH. Humid conditions or cold temperatures extend cure time | HIGH |
| **Rapid-set adhesive** | 2-4 hours | 6 hours | Use when schedule is tight. More expensive per bag | HIGH |
| **Large format tile adhesive** | 48 hours | 72 hours | Large tiles trap moisture under the tile face, extending cure time significantly | HIGH |
| **Flexible adhesive** (over floor heating) | 24 hours | 48 hours | Must be polymer-modified; standard rigid adhesive will fail over heating mats | HIGH |

### 6.2 Grout Curing Before Water Exposure

| Grout Type | Minimum Before Light Water Exposure | Minimum Before Shower Use | Full Cure | Confidence |
|------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Standard cement grout** | 48 hours | 72 hours (3 days) | 7 days | HIGH |
| **Rapid-set cement grout** | 24 hours | 48 hours | 3-5 days | HIGH |
| **Epoxy grout** | 24 hours | 24 hours | 24-48 hours | HIGH |

### 6.3 Other Waiting Periods

| Waiting Period | Duration | Context | Confidence |
|----------------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Waterproofing cure before tiling** | 4-48 hours (product dependent) | See Section 2.1 for specific product times | HIGH |
| **Levelling compound cure before tiling** | 24 hours minimum | Self-levelling compound must be fully hard before tile adhesive is applied | HIGH |
| **Grout cure before sealing** | 7-10 days | Grout must be fully cured before penetrating sealer is applied | HIGH |
| **Silicone cure before water exposure** | 24-72 hours (product dependent) | Neutral-cure silicone typically 24 hours for skin, 72 hours for full cure | HIGH |
| **Floor heating — do not turn on** | 28 days after tiling | Full adhesive and grout cure required before thermal cycling begins | HIGH |
| **New concrete slab cure before tiling** | 28 days minimum | Concrete must achieve design strength and release excess moisture before tiling. Moisture testing may be required | HIGH |

**Confidence: HIGH** — All curing times confirmed against Australian manufacturer specifications (Davco/Sika, Ardex, Laticrete, Mapei).

## 7. Common Sequencing Mistakes

These are the most frequent tiling sequencing errors in Australian residential renovations, based on industry publications, builder forums, and renovation specialist feedback.

### 7.1 Critical Mistakes (Result in Rework)

| Mistake | Consequence | How to Prevent |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tiling before waterproofing is certified** | If a leak develops, there is no warranty or compliance certificate. Insurance may not cover damage. Tiles may need to be removed for re-waterproofing | Never tile until the waterproofing compliance certificate is in hand |
| **Not confirming floor waste position before starting tile layout** | Tiles do not fall correctly to drain. Water pools on the floor. Tiles must be removed and re-laid | Tiler must physically check floor waste position and plan layout from that point BEFORE mixing any adhesive |
| **Tiling before floor heating mat is installed** | Floor heating cannot be retrofitted under tiles without removing them. The entire floor must be re-done | Confirm with client at project start whether floor heating is required. Coordinate electrician visit before tiler starts |
| **Grouting too early** | Adhesive has not cured. Grouting pushes tiles out of position. Adhesive bond fails. Tiles become loose | Follow manufacturer minimum cure times. In humid or cold conditions, add extra time |
| **Splashback tiled after benchtop is installed** | Tiles sit on top of the benchtop surface. Creates a visible silicone line prone to mould. Looks unprofessional | Tile splashback during the stone fabrication window (after cabinets, before benchtop). Use a temporary batten at benchtop height |
| **Using rigid adhesive over floor heating** | Thermal cycling cracks rigid adhesive. Tiles delaminate from the floor | Always use flexible (polymer-modified) adhesive over any heating element |

### 7.2 Common Mistakes (Result in Delays or Poor Quality)

| Mistake | Consequence | How to Prevent |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Not checking substrate flatness** | Tiles will not lay flat. Lippage between tiles. Hollow spots under tiles that crack under load | Tiler checks substrate with a 2m straight edge before starting. Report any variation exceeding 5mm over 3m to the builder |
| **Not dry-laying tiles before fixing** | Pattern misalignment, awkward cuts at edges, waste positions not centred on tiles | Tiler should dry-lay (place tiles without adhesive) the first few rows to confirm layout before fixing |
| **Not coordinating niche dimensions with tile size** | Niche requires excessive tile cutting, looks unprofessional, wastes tiles | Niche dimensions should be set during framing to align with the selected tile module |
| **Using grout instead of silicone at change-of-plane junctions** | Rigid grout at internal corners and wall-floor junctions will crack as the building moves | All change-of-plane junctions must use silicone, not grout. This is per AS 3958.1 |
| **Not protecting finished tiles from other trades** | Grout staining, surface scratches, chipped edges from other trades working on or walking over tiles | Apply cardboard or masonite protection over finished tiles immediately after grouting. Maintain until all other trades are complete |
| **Tiling in conditions below 5 degrees C or above 35 degrees C** | Adhesive and grout cure too slowly (cold) or too fast (hot), resulting in poor bonds or cracking | Check weather forecast before scheduling tiling. In extreme temperatures, consider rapid-set or slow-set products as appropriate |

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 8. Floor Tiling — Under Cabinets vs Up To Cabinets

This is one of the most debated tiling questions in Australian renovations. Both approaches are used in practice. The scope-of-works should specify which approach is being used, as it affects cost, scheduling, and coordination.

### 8.1 Option A: Tile Under Cabinets (Floor First, Then Cabinets)

**Sequence:** Floor tiles laid across the entire room, including where cabinets will sit. Cabinets are then installed on top of the tiled floor.

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Continuous floor surface** | No gaps, transitions, or exposed subfloor if cabinets are ever removed or reconfigured |
| **Better water protection** | Continuous tile surface under appliances (dishwasher, fridge) protects subfloor from leaks |
| **Easier future renovation** | Cabinets can be removed/replaced without exposing un-tiled floor |
| **Simpler tile layout** | No cutting around cabinet toe kicks; tiler works in an unobstructed room |
| **Cleaner finish** | No visible junction between tile and cabinet base |

| Disadvantage | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| **Higher material cost** | More tiles needed (typically 3-6 m2 extra for a standard kitchen) |
| **Slightly higher labour cost** | Tiler covers a larger area |
| **Appliance height issues** | Dishwashers may not fit under benchtop with the added tile height (typically 10-15mm). Must be checked during planning |
| **Risk of tile damage during cabinet install** | Cabinet installers may drop or drag heavy cabinets on the tile surface. Protection is essential |
| **Scheduling dependency** | Tiler must finish before cabinet maker can start. Any tiling delay pushes back cabinetry and all downstream trades |

### 8.2 Option B: Tile Up To Cabinets (Cabinets First, Then Tiles)

**Sequence:** Cabinets installed first. Floor tiles laid up to the cabinet toe kick. A small strip of exposed subfloor exists under the cabinets.

| Advantage | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Lower material cost** | Fewer tiles needed |
| **No appliance height issues** | Cabinets sit at the correct height on the subfloor |
| **Less risk of tile damage** | Tiles are not underfoot during heavy cabinet installation |

| Disadvantage | Detail |
|--------------|--------|
| **Exposed subfloor under cabinets** | If a dishwasher or fridge leaks, water contacts the unprotected subfloor. This can cause significant damage, especially on timber subfloors |
| **Visible junction at cabinet base** | The tile edge meets the cabinet toe kick. If not perfectly straight, a visible gap or uneven line is apparent |
| **Difficult future renovation** | Removing or moving cabinets exposes un-tiled floor. Matching tiles years later is often impossible |
| **Tiler works around obstacles** | More complex cuts around cabinet toe kicks, island bases, and end panels |

### 8.3 Industry Recommendation

**Tile under cabinets (Option A) is the preferred approach in the Australian renovation industry.** It provides better long-term protection, a cleaner finish, and greater flexibility for future changes. The extra material and labour cost is typically $300-$800 for a standard kitchen — a small premium for significantly better outcomes.

**Confidence: HIGH** — Confirmed across multiple Australian builder forums (Bunnings Workshop, Renovate Forum, Whirlpool), tiling industry guides (Beaumont Tiles, Amber Tiles), and international tile industry bodies (Ceramic Tile Foundation). The exception is budget renovations where cost is the primary constraint.

## 9. Splashback Sequencing — The Critical Junction

The relationship between tiled splashback and stone benchtop is the single most sequencing-sensitive detail in kitchen tiling. This section provides the definitive sequencing guide for the scope-of-works generator.

### 9.1 The Correct Sequence (Tile Splashback Before Benchtop)

```
KITCHEN SPLASHBACK — CORRECT SEQUENCE
=======================================

Week 1-2:   Cabinet installation
             ↓
Week 2-3:   Stone mason visits to template benchtop
             (measures from installed cabinets)
             ↓
Week 3-4:   FABRICATION WINDOW — stone is being fabricated offsite
             During this window:

             1. Electrician installs power points in splashback zone
             2. TILER tiles splashback:
                - Screws a temporary batten at exact benchtop height
                - Tiles from overhead cabinets DOWN to the batten
                - Bottom row of tiles rests on the batten
                - Grouting after adhesive cures (24 hours)
                - Removes batten after grout cures

             ↓
Week 5-6:   Stone benchtop installed
             - Top surface sits under bottom of tiles
             - Clean junction: stone meets tile

             ↓
Day after:  Silicone applied at tile-to-stone junction
             - Neutral cure, sanitary grade
             - Colour-matched to grout or stone
```

### 9.2 Why This Order Matters

| Factor | Tiles First (Correct) | Benchtop First (Incorrect) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Junction appearance** | Stone butts neatly against underside of tiles. Clean, professional line | Tiles sit on top of stone surface. Visible silicone gap on horizontal plane |
| **Water resistance** | Water running down the splashback hits the stone surface and drains away | Water can track behind the silicone joint between tile base and stone surface, leading to mould |
| **Mould risk** | Low — no horizontal silicone joint collecting moisture | High — horizontal silicone joint between tile and stone traps moisture |
| **Future tile replacement** | Tiles can be removed without damaging the stone benchtop | Tiles cannot be removed without risking damage to the stone surface |
| **Silicone maintenance** | Vertical silicone joint (easy to re-do) | Horizontal silicone joint (harder to maintain, more visible) |

### 9.3 The Exception — When Tiles Must Come After Benchtop

In some renovation scenarios, the splashback must be tiled after the benchtop is in place:

| Scenario | Reason | How to Handle |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Renovation where only replacing splashback tiles** (keeping existing benchtop) | Benchtop is already in place; removing it to tile behind is impractical | Tile from overheads down. Bottom row sits on top of the benchtop. Apply silicone at the horizontal junction. Accept the compromise |
| **Glass or stone splashback replacing tiled splashback** | Different trade (glazier or stone mason) handles the splashback, not the tiler | Not a tiling scope item — exclude from tiling scope |

**Confidence: HIGH**

## 10. Trade Coordination Matrix

This matrix summarises the sequencing relationship between the tiler and every other trade in a typical renovation.

### 10.1 Trades That Must Complete BEFORE Tiling

| Trade | What Must Be Done | Minimum Lead Time Before Tiling | Why |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----|
| **Demolition** | All strip-out complete | 1-5 days before tiling | Dust and debris must be cleared. Substrate must be exposed and clean |
| **Carpenter/Framer** | Wall framing, niche framing, timber blocking for shower screen | 3-7 days before tiling | Tiler needs stable, true wall surfaces. Blocking must be in place before sheeting and waterproofing |
| **Plumber (rough-in)** | All concealed pipework, waste positions, floor waste installed | 2-5 days before tiling | Tiler needs all fixture positions to plan tile layout |
| **Electrician (rough-in)** | All concealed cabling, power point boxes, floor heating mat | 2-5 days before tiling | Tiler cuts around electrical elements and tiles over floor heating |
| **Plasterer/Gyprocker** | Wall sheeting, cement sheet in wet areas, wall finishing | 2-3 days before tiling | Tiler needs flat, finished wall surfaces |
| **Waterproofer** | Membrane applied, cured, and certified | 1-2 days before tiling (after membrane cure) | Legal requirement. Cannot tile without compliance certificate |
| **Screeder** | Floor screed to falls (wet areas) | 1-7 days before tiling (screed must cure) | Tiler follows the screed falls. Screed must be hard enough to support tiling |

### 10.2 Trades That Work DURING the Tiling Period

| Trade | Interaction | Coordination Required |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **No other trade should be in the same room** | Tiling requires a clean, unobstructed space. Other trades create dust, debris, and vibrations that compromise adhesive bond | Schedule tiling as a sole-occupation trade in each room. Other trades can work in different rooms simultaneously |

### 10.3 Trades That Must Wait UNTIL AFTER Tiling

| Trade | What They Do | Minimum Wait After Tiling | Why |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-----|
| **Plumber (fit-off)** | Install taps, shower mixers, toilet, vanity plumbing connections | 72+ hours after grouting | Grout must cure. Fixtures are fixed to or through tiles. Wet fixtures cannot be used until grout is cured |
| **Electrician (fit-off)** | Install power points, switches, light fittings, connect thermostat for floor heating | 48+ hours after grouting | Power point cover plates are installed over tiles. Floor heating thermostat connection requires tiling to be complete |
| **Cabinet maker** | Install vanity, cabinetry (if not installed before tiling) | 48+ hours after floor tiling | Cabinets placed on tiled floor. Must not be placed on uncured adhesive/grout |
| **Stone mason** | Install benchtop | After splashback tiling is grouted and cured | Stone surface must butt cleanly against cured tile |
| **Glazier** | Measure and install shower screen | 7+ days after tiling (full grout cure) | Screen is measured from finished tile surfaces. Brackets drill through tile — tile must be fully bonded |
| **Painter** | Final coat and touch-ups | 48+ hours after grouting | Painter works around finished tiles. Touch-up any marks from tiling process |
| **Siliconist** | Apply silicone at all junctions | 24-48 hours after grouting | Silicone is applied after grout has set but does not require full grout cure |

**Confidence: HIGH**
