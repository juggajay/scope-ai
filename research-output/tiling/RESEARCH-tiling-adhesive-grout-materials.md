## 1. Tile Adhesive Types

### 1.1 Standard Cement-Based Adhesive (Powder Mix)

**What it is:** A dry powder blended from Portland cement, graded sand, and chemical additives. Mixed with water on-site to form a paste. The most common adhesive type for residential tiling in Australia.

**When appropriate:**
- Standard-format ceramic wall and floor tiles (up to ~450x450mm)
- Internal floors and walls on concrete, cement render, or fibre-cement sheet
- Where the substrate is stable and not subject to movement or vibration
- Dry areas and general-purpose installations

**When NOT appropriate:**
- Over underfloor heating systems (needs flexible adhesive)
- Large format tiles 600x600mm and above (needs flexible adhesive)
- Direct-to-waterproofing-membrane installations (most membranes require flexible adhesive)
- Exterior applications exposed to weather or thermal movement (needs flexible adhesive)
- Over existing tiles (needs flexible adhesive)

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Brand | Key Product | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dunlop | Floor Tile Adhesive | General purpose, indoor/outdoor floors, concrete/fibre-cement/existing tiles |
| Dunlop | Wall & Floor Tile Adhesive | Ceramic, porcelain, mosaics, natural stone (non-moisture-sensitive) |
| Ardex | ARDEX X 18 | Standard cement-based wall and floor adhesive |
| Mapei | Kerabond Plus | Cement-based powder adhesive for tiles and stone |
| Davco | Davco Floor & Wall Adhesive | General purpose cement-based |

**Typical coverage (20kg bag):**
- Walls (6mm notch trowel): ~5-6 m²
- Floors (10mm notch trowel): ~3-4 m²

---

### 1.2 Flexible / Rubber-Modified Adhesive

**What it is:** A cement-based adhesive with added polymer (latex/rubber) modification that gives the cured adhesive the ability to flex and accommodate minor substrate movement without cracking. This is the workhorse adhesive for professional Australian tilers on renovation projects.

**Why flexibility matters:** Renovations involve substrates that move — fibre-cement sheet expands and contracts with humidity, underfloor heating cycles cause thermal movement, waterproofing membranes are inherently flexible surfaces, and large format tiles amplify stress across the adhesive bed. A rigid standard adhesive will crack under these stresses, debonding tiles.

**When required (must-use):**
- Large format tiles (600x600mm and above) — mandatory
- Tiles over underfloor heating systems — mandatory
- Tiles over fibre-cement sheet (e.g. Villaboard, Hardies Tile Underlay) — mandatory
- Tiles directly over waterproofing membranes — mandatory
- External tiling exposed to thermal movement — mandatory
- Tiles over existing tiles — mandatory
- Porcelain tiles on floors (low porosity = higher stress on adhesive) — strongly recommended
- Any tile over 15kg individual weight — strongly recommended

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS 3958.1 references flexible adhesive for challenging substrates)

| Brand | Key Product | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dunlop | Tilers Rubber Modified | S1 flexible | High bond, walls & floors, indoor/outdoor |
| Ardex | ARDEX X 77 MICROTEC | S1 flexible (S2 when mixed with E90) | Fibre-reinforced, 60-min open time, ideal for large format wall tiles |
| Ardex | ARDEX X 78 | S1 flexible, rapid set | Fast-track flexible — grout in 3 hours |
| Mapei | Keraflex | S1 flexible | High performance, very low VOC (EC1 Plus), 30-min open time |
| Davco | SMP EVO | S1 flexible | Specifically for stone, marble, and porcelain |

**Key specification — S1 vs S2 classification:**

| Class | Deformability | When Needed |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | ≥ 2.5mm and < 5mm | Most residential flexible applications — over fibre-cement, large format, wet areas |
| S2 | ≥ 5mm | High-movement substrates — heated floors, external decks, structural movement joints, swimming pools |

**Scope impact:** For nearly all Australian renovation tiling (wet areas, over fibre-cement, large format porcelain), the scope should specify a **flexible/polymer-modified adhesive** (S1 minimum). Standard rigid adhesive is only appropriate for small-format ceramic tiles on stable concrete substrates in dry areas.

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 1.3 Rapid-Set Adhesive

**What it is:** A modified cement-based adhesive formulated to achieve handling strength much faster than standard adhesives. Allows grouting in as little as 2-4 hours vs 24 hours for standard products.

**When used:**
- Time-critical projects (single-bathroom renovations where downtime must be minimised)
- Commercial fit-outs with tight schedules
- Repair work where the area must be returned to service quickly
- When tiling in cold conditions (slow curing would otherwise delay grouting)

**Pros:**
- Grout in 2-4 hours (vs 24 hours)
- Reduces overall project timeline by 1-2 days
- Can be flexible (e.g. Ardex X 78 is both rapid and flexible)

**Cons:**
- Shorter working/open time (typically 15-20 minutes vs 30-60 minutes for standard)
- More expensive per bag than standard adhesive
- Requires faster, more confident workmanship — less room for adjustment
- Must mix in smaller batches to avoid waste

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Brand | Key Product | Open Time | Grout Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dunlop | Trade Resaflex Rapidset | ~20 min | 3 hours | Rubber-modified rapid, indoor/outdoor |
| Ardex | ARDEX X 78 | ~20 min | 3 hours | Rapid + flexible (S1), ideal for fast-track wet areas |
| Mapei | Keraflex Maxi S1 Rapid | ~20 min | 3-4 hours | Large format capable, S1 flexible |

---

### 1.4 Epoxy Adhesive

**What it is:** A two-component (resin + hardener) adhesive that cures by chemical reaction. Zero porosity, exceptional chemical resistance, and extremely high bond strength. Completely different to cement-based adhesives.

**When needed:**
- Swimming pools and permanently submerged installations
- Fibreglass pool shells (cement-based adhesives will not bond)
- Industrial areas requiring chemical resistance (commercial kitchens, laboratories, food processing)
- Areas exposed to aggressive chemicals or acids
- Where hygiene standards require non-porous adhesive (hospitals, cleanrooms)

**When NOT needed (and to be avoided in standard residential):**
- Standard bathrooms and kitchens — flexible cement-based is sufficient and far more cost-effective
- General residential floor and wall tiling — overkill and much harder to work with

**Cost impact:** 3-5x more expensive than cement-based flexible adhesive. Labour cost also higher due to mixing complexity and cleanup difficulty.

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Brand | Key Product | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mapei | Kerapoxy Adhesive | Two-component epoxy, acid-resistant, for pools and chemical exposure |
| Ardex | ARDEX WA | 100% solids epoxy grout AND adhesive, dual-purpose |

---

### 1.5 Pre-Mixed Adhesive (Bucket/Tub)

**What it is:** A ready-to-use paste adhesive sold in tubs or buckets. No mixing required. Cures by dehydration (moisture must evaporate out through the tile or grout joints) rather than chemical reaction.

**When appropriate:**
- Small areas of wall tiling only (kitchen splashbacks, feature walls)
- Ceramic wall tiles (porous body allows moisture to escape)
- Mosaic tiles on walls (many grout joints = more evaporation surface)
- Subway/metro tiles on dry-area walls
- DIY or small repair jobs where mixing equipment is impractical

**When NOT to use (critical limitations):**
- **Floor tiling** — insufficient strength, will not cure properly under impervious floor tiles
- **Large format tiles** — minimal grout joints prevent adequate moisture evaporation; adhesive may never fully cure
- **Wet areas (showers, baths)** — moisture prevents evaporation; adhesive remains soft and tiles will debond
- **Over waterproofing membranes** — will not cure properly
- **Porcelain tiles** — low porosity prevents moisture escape through tile body
- **Exterior applications** — not rated for moisture or thermal movement
- **Any tile larger than ~300x300mm on walls** — drying risk increases with tile size

**Why it fails:** Unlike cement-based adhesives (which cure by hydration — a chemical reaction) or epoxy (chemical reaction), pre-mixed adhesives dry by **dehydration only**. Moisture must physically leave the adhesive. If the tile is impervious (porcelain, large format with minimal joints) or the environment is wet, the adhesive never fully hardens.

**Scope impact:** Pre-mixed adhesive should **almost never appear in a renovation scope-of-works**. Professional tilers use cement-based powder adhesives for virtually all work. Pre-mixed is a consumer/DIY product.

**Confidence:** HIGH (confirmed by ARDEX Australia technical bulletin)

---

### 1.6 Adhesive Bed Thickness Requirements (AS 3958.1)

AS 3958.1:2007 specifies adhesive bed thickness limits. Exceeding these causes adhesive shrinkage, slow curing, and bond failure.

| Application | Minimum Bed Thickness | Maximum Bed Thickness | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thin-bed (standard) wall tiling | 1.5mm compressed | 3mm compressed | Using notched trowel, after tile pressed in |
| Thin-bed (standard) floor tiling | 3mm compressed | 6mm compressed | Standard cement-based and flexible adhesives |
| Medium-bed floor tiling | 6mm compressed | 12mm compressed | For levelling minor substrate irregularities; requires medium-bed rated product |
| Thick-bed (mortar) floor tiling | 12mm | 40mm | Traditional sand/cement screed bed — not typical in modern renovations |

**Key rule:** If the substrate requires more than 6mm of adhesive to achieve a level tile surface, the substrate should be levelled first with a self-levelling compound or screed, rather than building up excessive adhesive thickness.

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS 3958.1:2007)

---

### 1.7 Adhesive Coverage Requirements (AS 3958.1)

AS 3958.1:2007 sets minimum adhesive coverage under the tile (the percentage of tile back that has adhesive contact when the tile is lifted).

| Application | Minimum Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Internal residential walls | 65% | Standard dry-area walls |
| Internal residential floors | 80% | Standard dry-area floors |
| Wet area floors | 90% | Shower floors, bathroom floors |
| Wet area walls | 90% | Shower walls, bath surrounds |
| External walls | 90% | Balcony walls, external facades |
| External floors, decks, roofs | 90% | Balconies, terraces, roof decks |
| Large format tiles (600x600+) — all areas | 95-100% | Industry best practice; back-buttering required |
| Natural stone — all areas | 100% | Full coverage prevents moisture staining from behind |

**Scope impact:** Wet area tiling and large format tiles require near-complete adhesive coverage. This directly affects the adhesive application method (back-buttering becomes mandatory) and material consumption (more adhesive per m²).

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS 3958.1:2007 Clause 6.3)

---

## 2. Adhesive Application Methods

### 2.1 Notched Trowel Method (Standard)

The standard method: adhesive is spread on the substrate with the flat side of the trowel, then combed with the notched side to create uniform ridges. The tile is pressed into the ridges, which collapse to form the adhesive bed.

**Notch trowel size selection based on tile size:**

| Tile Size (longest edge) | Recommended Notch Size | Trowel Type | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mosaics (up to 50x50mm) | 3mm x 3mm | V-notch | Mosaic sheets on walls |
| Small tiles (up to 100x100mm) | 4mm x 4mm | V-notch or square | Small wall tiles |
| Medium tiles (100-200mm) | 6mm x 6mm | Square notch | Standard wall tiles, subway tiles |
| Standard tiles (200-400mm) | 6mm x 6mm | Square or U-notch | Standard wall and floor tiles |
| Large tiles (400-600mm) | 10mm x 10mm | Square notch | Large floor tiles, rectified porcelain |
| Large format (600mm+) | 12mm x 12mm | Square or U-notch | Large format porcelain — MUST also back-butter |
| Very large format (900mm+) | 15mm x 15mm | Square notch | Slab-format tiles — MUST back-butter |

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Coverage impact by trowel size (approximate per 20kg bag):**

| Notch Size | Wall Coverage | Floor Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| 6mm x 6mm | ~6-7 m² | ~5-6 m² |
| 10mm x 10mm | ~4-5 m² | ~3-4 m² |
| 12mm x 12mm | ~3-4 m² | ~2-3 m² |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies by product, substrate, and workmanship)

---

### 2.2 Back-Buttering

**What it is:** Applying a thin skim coat of adhesive to the back of the tile (in addition to the adhesive bed on the substrate) before pressing the tile into position.

**When required:**
- **Large format tiles (600x600mm and above)** — mandatory to achieve required coverage
- **Natural stone tiles** — mandatory for 100% coverage to prevent moisture staining
- **Tiles with deep-ribbed or uneven backs** — ridges prevent full contact without back-buttering
- **All wet area floor tiles** — strongly recommended for 90%+ coverage
- **Rectified porcelain on floors** — strongly recommended

**Why it matters:** Standard notched trowel application leaves ridges and voids. For small tiles this is acceptable (tiles are small enough that ridges collapse evenly). For large format tiles, the adhesive ridges may not fully collapse, leaving voids that compromise bond strength and can cause hollow-sounding tiles ("drummy tiles").

**Correct technique:**
1. Apply adhesive to substrate using correctly sized notched trowel
2. Apply thin (1-2mm) skim coat to tile back using flat side of trowel
3. Press tile into adhesive bed with slight twisting motion
4. Check coverage by occasionally lifting a freshly placed tile — target 95-100% contact

**Scope impact:** Any scope involving large format tiles or natural stone should include a note that "adhesive will be applied using back-buttering method to achieve minimum 95% coverage per AS 3958.1."

**Confidence:** HIGH

## 3. Grout Types

### 3.1 Cement-Based Grout (Standard)

**What it is:** A powder mix of Portland cement, fine sand (sanded version) or calcium carbonate (unsanded version), pigments, and polymer additives. Mixed with water on-site.

**Sanded vs Unsanded:**

| Property | Sanded Grout | Unsanded Grout |
|---|---|---|
| Contains sand | Yes — fine graded sand for strength | No — smooth powder |
| Joint width | 3mm to 15mm+ | 1mm to 3mm |
| Texture | Slightly rough/gritty | Smooth |
| Best for | Floor tiles, wide joints, large format | Narrow joints, rectified tiles, polished surfaces, wall tiles |
| Avoid on | Polished marble, glass mosaics (sand scratches surface) | Wide joints (will crack without sand reinforcement) |
| Strength | Higher compressive strength | Lower — fine for wall joints but not ideal for wide floor joints |

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Popular Australian cement grout products:**

| Brand | Product | Joint Width | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dunlop | Flexible Coloured Grout | 1-8mm | Grout Shield (mould/bacteria inhibitor), water-repellent, 12+ colours |
| Dunlop | Ultra White Grout | 1-4mm | Unsanded, super smooth, bright white |
| Ardex | ARDEX FG8 | 1-8mm | Rapid-set (walk-on in 3 hours), flexible, 40+ colours |
| Ardex | ARDEX FG Flex | 2-20mm | Wide-joint grout, floor and wall, colour-matched to FG8 range |
| Mapei | Keracolor FF | 1-6mm | Fine-grain cementitious, 44 colours, for narrow to medium joints |
| Mapei | Keracolor U | 3-20mm | Sanded, for wide joints, 44 colours |
| Davco | Sanitized Colorgrout | 1-6mm | Sanitized anti-bacterial technology, 19 colours |
| Davco | Sanitized Glue Grout | 1-6mm | Suitable as both grout and adhesive for mosaics |

**Limitations of cement grout:**
- **Porous** — absorbs water and stains unless sealed
- **Requires sealing** — especially in wet areas (see Section 5.2)
- **Can crack** if substrate moves (not flexible)
- **Mould-prone** in wet areas unless treated with anti-bacterial additive
- **Colour can fade** over time, especially in showers

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 3.2 Epoxy Grout

**What it is:** A two or three-component system (resin + hardener + optional filler) that cures by chemical reaction. Produces a grout joint that is non-porous, waterproof, stain-proof, and chemically resistant.

**When recommended:**
- **Shower recesses and wet areas** — superior moisture and mould resistance
- **Kitchen splashbacks** — stain resistance (coffee, wine, oil won't penetrate)
- **Steam showers** — cement grout deteriorates rapidly in steam environments
- **Glass mosaic tiles** — won't stain translucent glass from behind
- **Pool tiles and permanently submerged areas** — mandatory
- **Areas requiring chemical resistance** (commercial kitchens, laundries)
- **Where the homeowner wants zero-maintenance grout** — never needs sealing

**When cement grout is acceptable instead:**
- Dry-area floor tiling with proper sealing
- Standard wall tiling in non-wet areas
- Budget-conscious projects where the homeowner accepts regular sealing/maintenance

**Cost comparison (approximate Australian pricing, February 2026):**

| Type | Product Example | Approx. Cost per m² | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cement grout | Davco Sanitized Colorgrout 5kg | $3-6/m² | Plus sealer cost (~$1-2/m²) |
| Epoxy grout | Mapei Kerapoxy 10kg (~$180-230) | $12-25/m² | No sealer needed; higher labour cost |

**Epoxy grout is approximately 3-5x more expensive than cement grout** when including material cost. Labour is also higher because epoxy is harder to apply, must be mixed in small batches (45-minute pot life), and requires specialist cleanup.

**Application differences:**
- Must be mixed precisely (resin-to-hardener ratio is critical)
- Short working time (~30-45 minutes per batch)
- Applied in small sections — cannot mix a full bucket and work slowly
- Requires immediate cleanup with specific epoxy wash solution (not just water)
- Harder to achieve a smooth finish — requires experienced tiler
- Temperature-sensitive (too cold = won't cure; too hot = cures too fast)

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Popular Australian epoxy grout products:**

| Brand | Product | Joint Width | Colours | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mapei | Kerapoxy | 1mm+ | 15 colours | Industry standard epoxy, grout and adhesive |
| Mapei | Kerapoxy Easy Design | 1-10mm | 15 colours | Easier to apply variant with decorative finish |

## 4. Grout Joint Width Selection

### 4.1 What Determines Joint Width

Joint width is determined by a combination of tile type, size, pattern, and Australian Standard guidance.

**AS 3958.1:2007 recommended minimum joint widths:**

| Tile Type | Recommended Joint Width (Floors) | Recommended Joint Width (Walls) |
|---|---|---|
| Dust-pressed tiles (standard ceramic/porcelain) | 3mm minimum | 1.5mm minimum |
| Extruded tiles (terracotta, handmade) | 6mm minimum | 3mm minimum |
| Natural stone | 3mm minimum (varies by stone type) | 2mm minimum |

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS 3958.1:2007)

### 4.2 Rectified vs Non-Rectified Tiles

| Tile Type | Description | Joint Width Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rectified** | Machine-cut to exact size after firing; perfectly square edges | 1.5-3mm typical | Can achieve very narrow joints because edges are precise |
| **Non-rectified** | Natural fired edges; slight size variation tile-to-tile (±1-2mm) | 3-5mm typical | Wider joints needed to absorb dimensional variation |

**Scope impact:** The scope should note the grout joint width. If the homeowner wants very narrow joints (1.5-2mm), they MUST use rectified tiles. Non-rectified tiles with narrow joints look uneven and unprofessional.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 4.3 Joint Width by Tile Size (Practical Guide)

| Tile Size | Rectified Joint Width | Non-Rectified Joint Width | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mosaics (up to 100x100) | 2mm | 2-3mm | Consistent joints critical on mosaic sheets |
| Small (100x200, subway) | 1.5-2mm | 2-3mm | Subway tiles often look best at 2mm |
| Medium (300x300, 300x600) | 2-3mm | 3-4mm | Most common residential sizes |
| Large (600x600) | 2-3mm | 3-5mm | Rectified porcelain standard at 2mm |
| Large format (600x1200+) | 1.5-2mm | 3mm minimum | Narrow joints enhance the "slab" aesthetic |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (industry practice; AS 3958.1 gives minimums, not exact prescriptions)

### 4.4 Joint Width by Pattern

| Pattern | Joint Width Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Straight stack (grid) | Standard joint width | Easiest to achieve consistent joints |
| Brick bond (50% offset) | Standard joint width | Common for subway tiles and rectangular formats |
| Third offset (33%) | Standard joint width | Less lippage risk than 50% offset on large tiles |
| Herringbone | 2-3mm minimum | Tight angles require precise cutting; narrow joints hide minor imperfections |
| Chevron | 2-3mm minimum | Similar to herringbone |
| Diagonal (45°) | Standard + 1mm | Slightly wider joints compensate for cut-edge variations |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

## 5. Grout Colour & Sealing

### 5.1 Grout Colour Selection

**Who decides:** The **homeowner must confirm grout colour** before tiling begins. This is a critical design decision that significantly affects the final appearance.

**Selection process in scope-of-works:**
1. Scope should specify: "Grout colour to be selected by owner prior to commencement"
2. Tiler should provide colour chart (all major brands have 15-44 colour options)
3. Homeowner should view physical grout colour samples against their tile — screen colours are unreliable
4. Grout colour should be confirmed in writing before tiling begins

**Aesthetic impact:**

| Approach | Effect | Common Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Matching grout** (same colour as tile) | Seamless, continuous look; minimises grid pattern | Large format floors, feature walls, luxury bathrooms |
| **Contrasting grout** (different colour to tile) | Highlights tile pattern; defines each tile; design feature | Subway tiles, mosaics, heritage/decorative installations |
| **Neutral grey grout** | Compromise — doesn't stain as visibly as white, doesn't dominate pattern | Most practical choice for floors and wet areas |
| **White grout** | Clean, bright look but stains easily; requires maintenance | Bathroom walls, light-coloured tile schemes |
| **Dark grout** | Hides staining; can look dramatic; shows less dirt | Kitchen floors, dark tile schemes, high-traffic areas |

**Scope note:** "Supply and application of grout in owner-selected colour. Colour to be confirmed from manufacturer colour chart prior to installation."

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 5.2 Grout Sealing

**Applies to:** Cement-based grout ONLY. Epoxy grout does NOT require sealing (it is non-porous by nature).

**Why sealing is needed:** Cement grout is porous. Without sealing, it absorbs water, stains, soap scum, mould spores, and dirt. In wet areas, unsealed grout becomes a breeding ground for mould and mildew.

**Types of grout sealer:**

| Sealer Type | How It Works | Best For | Reapplication |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Penetrating/impregnating sealer** | Soaks into grout pores; chemically bonds; leaves surface breathable | Most residential tiling; wet areas; natural look | Every 1-5 years depending on product and traffic |
| **Topical sealer** | Forms a surface film over the grout | Where extra stain protection needed; decorative grout | Every 1-2 years (wears from foot traffic) |

**Sealing schedule:**

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| After installation | Seal grout 24-72 hours after grouting (once grout has fully cured). Apply 1-2 coats of penetrating sealer. |
| Ongoing (wet areas) | Re-seal every 1-2 years in showers and wet areas |
| Ongoing (floors) | Re-seal every 2-5 years depending on traffic |
| Ongoing (walls, dry areas) | Re-seal every 4-5 years or when water stops beading |

**Water bead test:** Drop water on the grout joint. If it beads on the surface, the sealer is still effective. If it absorbs and darkens the grout, re-sealing is needed.

**Popular Australian grout sealers:**

| Brand | Product | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Selleys | White For Life Grout Sealer | Topical/penetrating hybrid | Widely available at Bunnings; annual reapplication recommended |
| Aqua Mix | Penetrating Sealer | Penetrating/impregnating | Professional-grade; natural look; long-lasting |
| Davco | Sanitized Sealer | Penetrating | Anti-bacterial protection |
| DeepShield | Penetrating Grout Sealer | Penetrating | Premium, long-lasting; professional-only distribution |

**Scope impact:** Every scope with cement-based grout should include: "Apply penetrating grout sealer to all grouted joints after curing (allow minimum 24 hours). Homeowner to maintain by re-sealing every 1-2 years in wet areas."

If epoxy grout is specified, note: "Epoxy grout does not require sealing."

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

## 6. Silicone & Sealant

### 6.1 Where Silicone Is Required

Silicone (flexible sealant) is required at every location where two planes meet or where the tiled surface meets a different material. Grout alone is **NOT sufficient** at these locations because grout is rigid — any movement at a junction will crack rigid grout.

**Mandatory silicone locations (per AS 3958.1):**

| Location | Why | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **All internal corners** (wall-to-wall) | Walls move independently; rigid grout will crack | Vertical line of silicone from floor to ceiling |
| **Wall-to-floor junctions** | Floor and walls expand/contract differently | Continuous bead along entire perimeter |
| **Around all fixtures and penetrations** | Pipes, taps, shower heads, towel rails, toilet flanges | Prevents water ingress behind tiles |
| **Perimeter joints** (tile to non-tiled surface) | Where tiles meet cabinetry, benchtops, door frames, window frames | Accommodates differential movement |
| **Around bath edges** | Bath moves when filled/emptied | Critical waterproofing joint |
| **Around shower screens and bases** | Movement between glass/acrylic and tile | Must be watertight |
| **Movement/control joints** | Where movement joints are specified in the substrate | Silicone allows the joint to function |
| **Where tiles meet different materials** | Timber thresholds, carpet strips, stone benchtops | Different thermal expansion rates |

**Common mistake:** Some tilers grout internal corners instead of using silicone. This will crack within weeks to months and is a defect. The scope should explicitly specify silicone at all corners and junctions.

**Confidence:** HIGH (AS 3958.1:2007 Clause 7.4)

---

### 6.2 Colour-Matched Silicone

**Importance:** The silicone colour should match the grout colour as closely as possible. Mismatched silicone (e.g. white silicone with grey grout) is visually jarring and looks unprofessional.

All major Australian grout manufacturers produce silicone colour-matched to their grout ranges:

| Brand | Silicone Product | Colour Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ardex | ARDEX SE | 25+ colours matched to ARDEX grout range | Acetoxy cure, mould-resistant, for movement and connecting joints |
| Mapei | Mapesil AC | 44 colours matched to Keracolor grout range | Acetoxy cure, mould-resistant |
| Davco | Davco Silicone | 19 colours matched to Sanitized Colorgrout | Neutral cure, mould-resistant |
| Adheseal | S-100 Sanitary Silicone | 20+ colours | Neutral cure, ±25% movement, built-in fungicide |

**Scope note:** "Supply and apply colour-matched silicone sealant to all internal corners, wall-floor junctions, perimeter joints, and around all fixtures. Silicone colour to match grout colour."

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 6.3 Mould-Resistant Silicone

**When to specify:** ALL wet areas. Standard silicone will grow mould (black spots) in shower recesses within 6-12 months. Mould-resistant (anti-fungal / Sanitized) silicone contains biocide additives that inhibit mould growth.

**Scope impact:** ALWAYS specify "mould-resistant" or "sanitary-grade" silicone for bathrooms, showers, laundries, and any wet area. This is standard professional practice in Australia. Using non-sanitary silicone in a wet area is a defect.

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 6.4 Neutral Cure vs Acetoxy Silicone

| Property | Acetoxy Cure | Neutral Cure |
|---|---|---|
| **Curing mechanism** | Releases acetic acid (vinegar smell) | No acid release; cures via moisture without corrosive byproduct |
| **Smell** | Strong vinegar odour during curing | Minimal to no odour |
| **Cure speed** | Fast — tack-free in ~20 minutes | Slower — tack-free in ~30 minutes |
| **Bond strength** | Excellent on non-porous surfaces (glass, glazed tiles, ceramic) | Good on all surfaces; better on porous/sensitive materials |
| **Suitable for** | Glazed ceramic/porcelain tile, glass, metal | Natural stone (marble, limestone, travertine), mirror, metal, most substrates |
| **NOT suitable for** | Natural stone (acid can etch/discolour), mirror backing (can corrode), concrete | — (compatible with almost everything) |
| **Cost** | Slightly cheaper | Slightly more expensive |
| **Availability** | Very common; ARDEX SE, Mapesil AC | Increasingly standard; Adheseal S-100, Davco Silicone |

**Decision rule for scope-of-works:**

| Tile Material | Silicone Type |
|---|---|
| Glazed ceramic or porcelain | Either — acetoxy is fine and commonly used |
| Natural stone (marble, travertine, limestone, slate) | **Neutral cure ONLY** — acid from acetoxy will etch/stain the stone |
| Glass mosaic | Either — but neutral cure is safer |
| Near mirrors or metal fittings | Neutral cure preferred (avoids potential corrosion) |
| Mixed materials (stone + ceramic) | Neutral cure (safe for both) |

## 7. Tile Sealing

### 7.1 Which Tiles Need Sealing

**Critical distinction:** NOT all tiles need sealing. Glazed tiles have a factory-applied glass-like surface that is already impervious. Only porous or unglazed tiles require sealing.

| Tile Type | Needs Sealing? | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Glazed ceramic** | NO | Glaze is impervious; sealer has no benefit |
| **Glazed porcelain** | NO | Glaze is impervious; fully vitrified body |
| **Unglazed porcelain** (e.g. full-body porcelain) | YES — light seal recommended | Micro-porosity can stain; a penetrating sealer protects without changing appearance |
| **Natural stone — marble** | YES — mandatory | Highly porous; stains easily; etches with acid |
| **Natural stone — travertine** | YES — mandatory | Very porous with natural pitting; absorbs moisture and stains rapidly |
| **Natural stone — limestone** | YES — mandatory | Soft, porous, acid-sensitive |
| **Natural stone — slate** | YES — recommended | Varies by slate type; most benefit from sealing |
| **Natural stone — granite** | YES — recommended | Less porous than marble but still benefits from sealing |
| **Cement/encaustic tiles** | YES — mandatory (multiple coats) | Extremely porous; will stain permanently if not sealed before grouting |
| **Terracotta** | YES — mandatory | Very porous; must be sealed before and after grouting |

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 7.2 Sealer Types

| Sealer Type | How It Works | Best For | Changes Appearance? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Penetrating/impregnating sealer** | Absorbs into stone pores; chemically bonds with the stone structure; repels water and oil from within | Marble, travertine, limestone, granite, unglazed porcelain | No — "natural look"; stone retains original colour and texture |
| **Topical sealer** | Creates a physical coating on the surface | Where enhanced sheen/gloss is desired; cement tiles | Yes — can add sheen, change colour depth, may become slippery |
| **Colour-enhancing sealer** | Penetrating sealer that intensifies the stone's natural colour | Dark stone (slate, dark granite) where owner wants richer colour | Yes — deepens colour |

**Recommendation for residential renovation:** Penetrating/impregnating sealer is the standard choice for natural stone in Australian homes. It protects without altering appearance and allows the stone to breathe (release moisture trapped in the substrate).

**Confidence:** HIGH

---

### 7.3 Sealing Schedule

| Stage | Action | Products | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pre-grouting seal** (natural stone and cement tiles) | Apply 1-2 coats of penetrating sealer to tile face BEFORE grouting | Aqua Mix Penetrating Sealer, Davco Natural Stone Sealer | Critical step — prevents grout pigment from staining the stone face. Allow minimum 2 hours between coats. Allow minimum 2 hours after final coat before grouting. |
| **Post-installation seal** | Apply 1-2 coats of penetrating sealer after grouting is complete and cured (24-72 hours) | Same as above | Seals both tile face and grout joints |
| **Maintenance seal** | Re-apply sealer periodically | Same as above | See frequency table below |

**Cement/encaustic tile specific:** These tiles require the most aggressive sealing regimen — minimum 2 coats before grouting and 1-2 coats after. The entire process can take 10+ days including drying time between coats. The scope must account for this extended timeline.

**Maintenance re-sealing frequency:**

| Location | Re-Seal Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Shower floor (natural stone) | Every 6-12 months | Constant water exposure accelerates sealer wear |
| Bathroom floor | Every 1-2 years | Moderate exposure |
| Kitchen floor | Every 1-2 years | Food and oil spills test sealer regularly |
| Kitchen benchtop (stone) | Every 6-12 months | Daily use demands frequent re-sealing |
| Entrance/hallway floor | Every 2-3 years | Foot traffic wears sealer |
| Living area floor | Every 3-5 years | Low traffic/exposure |
| Walls | Every 5+ years | Minimal exposure |

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (varies significantly by product, stone type, and usage)

## 8. Waterproofing Membrane (Tiler-Applied)

### 8.1 Overview

In Australian residential renovations, waterproofing of wet areas (bathrooms, showers, laundries) is governed by **AS 3740:2021** (Waterproofing of domestic wet areas) and referenced by the National Construction Code (NCC) Part 10.2.

Waterproofing may be performed by the tiler (if appropriately licensed) or by a separate licensed waterproofer. The scope-of-works must clearly state who is responsible for waterproofing.

---

### 8.2 Membrane Types

| Type | Description | Pros | Cons | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Liquid-applied membrane** | Painted on as a liquid, cures to a flexible rubber-like film. 2 coats minimum. | Seamless coverage; easy to apply in confined spaces; bonds to most substrates; most common in residential | Requires drying time between coats; film thickness must be verified; sensitive to temperature during application | Showers, bathrooms, laundries — standard for residential |
| **Sheet membrane** | Pre-formed rubber or bituminous sheet, cut to size and bonded to substrate | Consistent thickness; no curing uncertainty; immediate tiling after bonding | Joints and overlaps need careful sealing; harder in tight spaces; more expensive | Balconies, large floor areas, commercial |

**For Australian residential renovation, liquid-applied membrane is the standard choice** in almost all cases. Sheet membrane is used for balconies and specific commercial applications.

**Confidence:** HIGH

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Minimum coats** | 2 coats for liquid-applied membranes |
| **Minimum dry film thickness** | 1.0mm for Class III membranes |
| **Reinforcing tape/fabric** | Required at ALL internal corners (wall-wall, wall-floor junctions), around penetrations, and at hob (shower hob) junctions |
| **Bond breaker/fillet** | A 12mm fillet (triangular bead of sealant) must be installed at all wall-floor, wall-wall, and hob-wall junctions BEFORE membrane application, for Class III membranes |
| **Pre-formed corners** | Waterproof corner pieces (internal and external) may be used instead of fabric tape at corners |

### 8.5 Licensing — Who Can Legally Waterproof?

This is a critical scope-of-works consideration. Licensing requirements vary by state.

| State | Can Tiler Do Waterproofing? | Licence Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | Yes, if separately licensed | Must hold a waterproofing licence (or supervisor certificate) separate from tiling licence. Work over $5,000 requires contractor licence. | Two distinct licences — tiling licence alone does NOT permit waterproofing |
| **VIC** | Yes, if separately licensed | Must hold a waterproofing registration from VBA. Work over $5,000 requires registered building practitioner. | Separate licence class from tiling |
| **QLD** | Yes, with conditions | Tiler may perform waterproofing for tiling purposes. Work under $3,300 may not require a licence but must demonstrate competence. | More flexible — tiler can waterproof for their own tiling work |
| **SA** | Yes, with conditions | Wall and floor tiling registration allows "waterproofing limited to bathrooms, laundries, and balconies" | Registration includes limited waterproofing scope |
| **WA** | Yes, if registered | Must be a registered building service contractor for waterproofing work | Separate registration may be required |
| **TAS** | Check current requirements | Licensing requirements vary; check Consumer, Building and Occupational Services | — |
| **ACT** | Check current requirements | Must hold appropriate licence class | — |
| **NT** | Check current requirements | Licensed building work; check NT Building Practitioners Board | — |

**Scope impact:**
- The scope MUST identify who is responsible for waterproofing (tiler or separate waterproofer)
- If the tiler is providing waterproofing, the scope should note: "Tiler holds appropriate waterproofing licence for [state]"
- If a separate waterproofer is required, the scope should include waterproofing as a **separate trade item** (not under tiling)
- The scope should include: "Waterproofing to comply with AS 3740:2021. Flood test to be conducted and documented."
- **Certificate of waterproofing compliance** must be provided in NSW, VIC, and QLD

**Confidence:** HIGH (confirmed via state government websites)

## 9. Product Quick-Reference Tables

### 9.1 Adhesive Selection Decision Tree

Use this table to determine the correct adhesive type for a scope-of-works:

| Scenario | Adhesive Type | Minimum Class | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small ceramic tiles on stable concrete wall (dry area) | Standard cement-based | C1 | Cheapest option; only for ideal conditions |
| Standard tiles on fibre-cement sheet | **Flexible cement-based** | C2S1 | Fibre-cement moves — must use flexible |
| Tiles over waterproofing membrane | **Flexible cement-based** | C2S1 | Membrane is flexible substrate |
| Large format tiles (600x600+) any location | **Flexible cement-based** | C2S1 | Back-buttering mandatory |
| Tiles over underfloor heating | **Flexible cement-based** | C2S2 | S2 (high deformability) for thermal movement |
| Tiles over existing tiles | **Flexible cement-based** | C2S1 | Movement between layers |
| External tiling (balcony, patio) | **Flexible cement-based** | C2S2 | Thermal movement + moisture exposure |
| Natural stone (any location) | **Flexible cement-based (white)** | C2S1 | White adhesive prevents dark bleed-through on light stone |
| Pool tiles / submerged | **Epoxy adhesive** | Epoxy | Chemical resistance + permanent immersion |
| Small wall mosaic (dry area) | Standard or pre-mixed | C1 | Only scenario where pre-mixed is acceptable |
| Fast-track project | **Rapid-set flexible** | C2S1 Fast | Grout in 2-4 hours |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 9.2 Grout Selection Decision Tree

| Scenario | Grout Type | Joint Width | Sealing Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard floor tiling (dry area) | Cement-based sanded | 3-5mm | Yes — penetrating sealer |
| Standard wall tiling (dry area) | Cement-based unsanded | 1.5-3mm | Optional but recommended |
| Wet area (shower, bathroom) | Cement-based sanded/unsanded (budget) OR **Epoxy (recommended)** | Per tile type | Cement: Yes. Epoxy: No |
| Kitchen splashback | Cement-based (budget) OR **Epoxy (recommended)** | 1.5-3mm | Cement: Yes. Epoxy: No |
| Natural stone tiles | Cement-based unsanded (narrow joints) | 2-3mm | Yes — but seal stone BEFORE grouting |
| Pool / submerged | **Epoxy** (mandatory) | 2-3mm | No |
| Glass mosaic | **Epoxy** (recommended) or unsanded cement | 2mm | Cement: Yes. Epoxy: No |
| High-traffic commercial floor | **Epoxy** (recommended) | 3-5mm | No |
| Steam shower | **Epoxy** (mandatory) | 2-3mm | No |

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 9.3 Materials Checklist for Scope-of-Works

Every tiling scope should consider the following materials. Not all will be needed for every project.

| Material | Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tile adhesive (flexible cement-based) | Always | Specify S1 or S2 as needed |
| Grout (cement or epoxy) | Always | Specify type; colour selected by owner |
| Silicone sealant (colour-matched, mould-resistant) | Always | All corners, junctions, perimeters, penetrations |
| Grout sealer (penetrating) | If cement grout | Apply after grouting cures; not needed for epoxy grout |
| Tile sealer (penetrating) | If natural stone, unglazed porcelain, or cement tiles | Pre-grout and post-install application |
| Waterproofing membrane | If wet area | Liquid-applied, 2 coats, reinforcing tape at corners |
| Reinforcing tape / bond breaker | If waterproofing | All internal corners and junctions |
| Pre-formed waterproof corners | If waterproofing | Internal and external corner pieces |
| Puddle flanges | If waterproofing | Around all floor waste and pipe penetrations |
| Self-levelling compound | If substrate is uneven | Applied before tiling to achieve flat substrate |
| Primer (substrate) | Depends on substrate | Required on some surfaces (plasterboard, painted surfaces) |
| Tile spacers | Always | Size matches specified joint width |
| Movement joint profile | If required | Long runs (>5-6m), junctions with structural elements |
| Transition strips | If required | Where tile meets different flooring (timber, carpet) |
