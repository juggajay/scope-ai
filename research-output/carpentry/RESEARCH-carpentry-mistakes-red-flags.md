## 9.1 Choosing Cabinetry Based on Showroom Without Understanding Material Differences

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners visit showrooms, fall in love with a display kitchen, and assume the quoted price delivers the same quality. Showroom kitchens almost always use premium materials, top-tier hardware, and the best finishes. The quote the homeowner receives -- especially from budget or mid-range suppliers -- may use completely different (cheaper) materials for the same visual appearance.

### Impact

- Homeowner pays for what they think is a "premium" kitchen and receives a "basic" kitchen
- Carcass material might be 16mm white melamine particleboard instead of 18mm HMR (High Moisture Resistant) board
- Door material might be thermolaminated (vinyl wrap) instead of 2-pac polyurethane
- Hardware might be unbranded Chinese soft-close instead of Blum or Hettich
- The kitchen looks similar on day one but deteriorates faster: doors warp, hinges sag, drawers fail, laminate chips at edges

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Any cabinetry scope item | "WARNING: Confirm the following material specifications with your cabinet maker before signing a contract: (1) Carcass material and thickness (e.g., 18mm HMR vs 16mm standard particleboard), (2) Door material and finish (e.g., 2-pac polyurethane, laminate, thermolaminated/vinyl wrap, timber veneer), (3) Hardware brand (e.g., Blum, Hettich, or equivalent -- specify brand in contract), (4) Benchtop material and thickness. Do not assume that the showroom display matches the quoted specification." |
| Kitchen cabinetry | "NOTE: Request a written specification sheet listing all materials and hardware brands. If the quote says 'soft-close hinges' without a brand, ask which brand. There is a significant quality and longevity difference between premium hardware (Blum, Hettich, Grass -- 15+ year lifespan) and budget hardware (3-5 year lifespan)." |

### Key Material Comparison for AI Reference

| Component | Budget | Mid-Range | Premium |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Carcass** | 16mm white melamine particleboard | 18mm HMR (moisture resistant) board | 18mm HMR or plywood |
| **Doors** | Thermolaminated (vinyl wrap) | Laminate (Laminex, Polytec) | 2-pac polyurethane or solid timber |
| **Hinges** | Unbranded soft-close | Hettich or equivalent | Blum clip-top BLUMOTION |
| **Drawer runners** | Unbranded roller/ball bearing | Hettich Quadro or equivalent | Blum TANDEMBOX/LEGRABOX |
| **Benchtop** | Laminate (Laminex, Formica) | Engineered stone (Caesarstone, Essastone) | Natural stone, porcelain, or solid timber |
| **Kickboards** | Standard MDF or melamine | MR MDF (moisture resistant) | Aluminium or stainless steel |
| **Shelves** | 16mm melamine | 18mm melamine on HMR | 18mm HMR with edging |

## 9.2 Not Confirming Exact Appliance Dimensions Before Cabinet Order

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners order cabinetry before confirming the exact make and model of every appliance. Appliance dimensions -- particularly fridges, ovens, cooktops, rangehoods, and dishwashers -- vary significantly between brands and models. A French door fridge can be anywhere from 680mm to 920mm wide and 640mm to 850mm deep. If the cabinetry opening is designed for one fridge and the homeowner buys a different one, the result is an expensive disaster.

### Impact

- Fridge doesn't fit in the allocated space (too wide, too deep, or too tall)
- Oven doesn't fit the oven tower (600mm vs 900mm width, depth varies by brand)
- Cooktop cutout is wrong size (induction cooktops vary in depth and edge profile)
- Rangehood doesn't align with cabinetry (canopy width, duct diameter, motor location)
- Dishwasher opening is wrong (standard 600mm vs slimline 450mm)
- Microwave niche too small or too large
- Modifications to already-manufactured cabinetry are extremely expensive or impossible
- In worst cases, entire cabinet panels must be remade

### Common Appliance Dimensions to Confirm

| Appliance | Dimension Variables | Common Sizes (Australia) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Fridge (single door)** | Width, depth, height, door swing clearance, ventilation gap | W: 600-700mm, D: 600-700mm, H: 1700-1800mm |
| **Fridge (French door)** | Width, depth, height, door swing, water connection side | W: 680-920mm, D: 640-850mm, H: 1700-1800mm |
| **Wall oven** | Width, depth, height, ventilation requirements | 600mm or 900mm wide, D: 540-600mm |
| **Cooktop** | Width, depth, cutout dimensions, edge profile | 600mm or 900mm wide, cutout varies by model |
| **Rangehood** | Canopy width, depth, duct diameter (150mm or 200mm), motor location (in canopy vs remote) | 600mm, 900mm, or 1200mm wide |
| **Dishwasher** | Width, height (adjustable legs), depth | Standard 600mm or slimline 450mm |
| **Microwave** | Width, depth, height, ventilation clearances | Varies enormously -- no standard |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Kitchen cabinetry scope | "CRITICAL: Confirm exact appliance make, model, and dimensions BEFORE finalising cabinetry design. Provide appliance specification sheets to your cabinet maker. Key items to confirm: fridge (width, depth, height, ventilation gaps), oven (600mm vs 900mm, depth), cooktop (cutout dimensions), rangehood (canopy width, duct diameter, motor location), dishwasher (600mm standard vs 450mm slimline), microwave (niche dimensions including ventilation clearances)." |
| Fridge space in kitchen plan | "WARNING: Fridge dimensions vary significantly between brands and models. French door fridges range from 680mm to 920mm wide. Allow minimum 20mm clearance each side and confirm ventilation gap requirements with the fridge manufacturer. Buying the fridge BEFORE ordering cabinetry is strongly recommended." |
| Rangehood specified | "NOTE: Confirm rangehood canopy width, duct diameter (150mm or 200mm), and motor location (in-canopy or remote/roof-mounted) before finalising overhead cabinetry design. The cabinet maker needs these details to build the correct housing." |

## 9.3 Underestimating Lead Times -- Cabinets Are the Longest Lead-Time Item

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners frequently underestimate how long cabinetry takes from start to finish. Custom cabinetry is almost always the longest lead-time item in a residential renovation. Homeowners often don't start the cabinetry process early enough, causing the entire project to stall while waiting for cabinets.

### Impact

- Entire renovation timeline delayed by 4-12 weeks
- Other trades (plumbers, electricians, tilers) have to be rescheduled -- potentially losing their booking
- Builder sits idle waiting for cabinets, potentially charging holding costs
- Rushed design decisions to try to make up time, leading to mistakes
- Premium charges for expedited manufacturing (if available at all)

### Typical Cabinetry Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Initial consultation and measure** | 1-2 weeks | Cabinet maker visits site, takes measurements, discusses design |
| **Design and quoting** | 1-3 weeks | Drawings produced, revisions, quote finalised |
| **Design sign-off and deposit** | 1-2 weeks | Homeowner reviews, approves, pays deposit |
| **Manufacturing** | 4-8 weeks | Custom cabinetry. Longer for 2-pac doors (spray painting adds 1-2 weeks). Peak periods (Oct-Feb) can push to 10-12 weeks |
| **Delivery** | 1-3 days | Depends on distance and access |
| **Installation** | 3-5 days | Standard kitchen. Larger or complex kitchens: 5-10 days |
| **TOTAL** | 8-18 weeks | From first contact to installed kitchen |

### Critical Path Dependencies

```
Demolition complete
    --> Electrical rough-in
    --> Plumbing rough-in
    --> Framing / structural work
    --> Plasterboard / plastering
    --> Cabinetry installation  <-- THIS IS THE BOTTLENECK
        --> Benchtop template (after cabinets installed)
            --> Benchtop manufacture (2-3 weeks for stone)
                --> Benchtop installation
                    --> Splashback (after benchtop)
                        --> Plumbing fit-off
                        --> Electrical fit-off
```

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Kitchen renovation scope | "TIMELINE WARNING: Custom cabinetry typically takes 8-18 weeks from initial consultation to installation. This is usually the longest lead-time item in a kitchen renovation. Start the cabinetry design process as early as possible -- ideally before demolition begins. Delays in cabinetry will delay benchtop, splashback, plumbing fit-off, and electrical fit-off." |
| Any cabinetry order | "NOTE: Manufacturing lead times for custom cabinetry are typically 4-8 weeks. Add 1-2 weeks for 2-pac (polyurethane) painted doors. Peak periods (October to February) may extend lead times to 10-12 weeks. Confirm lead time with your cabinet maker at the time of order and build this into your renovation schedule." |
| Renovation schedule | "REMINDER: Benchtop cannot be templated until cabinetry is installed. Stone benchtops then take an additional 2-3 weeks to manufacture and install. Factor this into your timeline -- the kitchen will not be functional until benchtop is installed and plumbing is reconnected." |

## 9.4 Not Understanding What "Supply and Install" Includes for Cabinetry

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners see a "supply and install" quote for kitchen cabinetry and assume it covers everything needed for a complete, functional kitchen. In reality, "supply and install of cabinetry" covers only the cabinet boxes, doors, and their physical installation. Many critical components are excluded.

### Impact

- Budget blowout when homeowner discovers what's NOT included
- Project delays while additional items are sourced and coordinated
- Disputes with cabinet maker about what was and wasn't included
- The "complete kitchen" is actually only 50-60% of the total cost

### What "Supply and Install" Typically Includes vs Excludes

| Typically INCLUDED | Typically EXCLUDED |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cabinet carcasses (boxes) | Benchtop (stone, laminate, or timber) |
| Cabinet doors and drawer fronts | Appliances (oven, cooktop, dishwasher, rangehood, microwave) |
| Hinges and drawer runners | Handles/knobs (often a PC sum or excluded entirely) |
| Internal shelves (standard) | Splashback (tile, glass, or stone) |
| Delivery to site | Plumbing (rough-in and fit-off) |
| Installation (securing to walls, levelling) | Electrical (rough-in and fit-off) |
| Kickboards (base cabinets) | Demolition and removal of old kitchen |
| | Tiling or flooring |
| | Painting or plastering |
| | Sink and tapware |
| | Waste disposal unit |
| | Lighting (under-cabinet, in-cabinet) |
| | Internal accessories (pull-out bins, spice racks, lazy susans) -- often PC sums |

### Typical Cost Breakdown: Complete Kitchen vs Cabinetry Only

| Component | % of Total Kitchen Cost | Typical Range |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Cabinetry (supply and install)** | 35-45% | $8,000 - $30,000 |
| **Benchtop** | 15-25% | $3,000 - $12,000 |
| **Appliances** | 15-25% | $3,000 - $15,000 |
| **Plumbing** | 5-8% | $1,500 - $4,000 |
| **Electrical** | 8-12% | $3,000 - $8,000 |
| **Splashback** | 5-10% | $1,500 - $5,000 |
| **Other (demolition, tiling, painting, handles, accessories)** | 5-10% | $1,500 - $5,000 |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Cabinetry supply and install quote | "IMPORTANT: 'Supply and install' of cabinetry typically EXCLUDES: benchtop, appliances, handles, splashback, plumbing, electrical, demolition, tiling, painting, sink and tapware. Cabinetry typically represents only 35-45% of the total kitchen renovation cost. Ensure your budget accounts for all other components. Read the inclusions and exclusions list carefully." |
| Kitchen renovation budget | "BUDGET WARNING: A complete kitchen renovation costs significantly more than the cabinetry quote alone. If your cabinetry quote is $15,000, expect the total kitchen renovation to be in the range of $35,000-$50,000 once benchtop, appliances, plumbing, electrical, splashback, and other trades are included." |

## 9.5 Assuming Handles Are Included in Cabinet Quote

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Kitchen handles (pulls, knobs, and T-bars) are almost always either excluded from cabinetry quotes or included as a small provisional cost (PC) sum that does not reflect the homeowner's actual selection. Homeowners are surprised when they discover that handles for a full kitchen can cost $200-$2,500 depending on style and quality.

### Impact

- Unexpected additional cost of $200-$2,500
- If handles are an afterthought, the style may not match the kitchen design
- Handle drilling positions must be confirmed before doors are manufactured (some cabinet makers pre-drill; others do not)
- Changing handle style after doors are made may require new drilling -- which can damage the door

### Handle Cost Guide

| Handle Type | Cost Per Handle | Typical Kitchen (20-30 handles) | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Basic knob (builder's range) | $3 - $10 | $60 - $300 | Functional but plain |
| Standard bar pull (200-300mm) | $8 - $20 | $160 - $600 | Most common choice |
| Designer/premium pull | $25 - $80 | $500 - $2,400 | Branded, architectural styles |
| Integrated/routed handle (J-pull) | $0 (built into door) | $0 additional | Handle is part of the door profile. Adds to door manufacturing cost instead |
| Leather or timber pull | $30 - $100+ | $600 - $3,000+ | Premium/boutique kitchens |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Cabinetry scope (any kitchen) | "NOTE: Kitchen handles are typically excluded from cabinetry quotes or included as a minimal PC sum. A standard kitchen requires 20-30 handles. Budget $5-$20 per handle for mid-range options ($100-$600 total) or $25-$80 per handle for designer options ($500-$2,400 total). Confirm with your cabinet maker whether handles are included, and if so, what allowance per handle." |
| Cabinetry design phase | "REMINDER: Confirm handle style and drilling positions BEFORE doors are manufactured. Some handles require specific drilling centres (e.g., 128mm, 160mm, 256mm). Changing handle style after manufacturing may require new drilling which can damage the door face." |

## 9.6 Not Planning for Services (GPOs Behind Cabinets, Plumbing Through Island)

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Electrical and plumbing services must be positioned to exactly match the final cabinet layout. If the kitchen design is not finalised before electrical and plumbing rough-in occurs, services end up in the wrong locations. This is especially critical for island benches on concrete slabs, where services must be cast into the slab before it is poured -- or chased in afterwards at great expense.

### Impact

- Electrical outlets (GPOs) end up behind cabinet backs where they are inaccessible
- Plumbing rough-in doesn't align with sink or dishwasher position
- Island bench has no power or water because services weren't run through the slab
- Modifications after cabinetry is installed require cutting into the back of cabinets, moving pipes, or chasing into concrete -- all of which are very expensive
- Rangehood duct position doesn't align with rangehood location in cabinetry
- Total additional cost for service relocation after cabinets: $500-$5,000+

### Critical Services to Plan Before Cabinetry

| Service | Must Be Positioned For | When It Must Be Done |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Benchtop GPOs | Exact position relative to splashback height and cabinet layout | Electrical rough-in (before plaster) |
| Fridge GPO | Behind or beside fridge position | Electrical rough-in |
| Oven connection | Behind oven tower (hardwired or GPO depending on oven type) | Electrical rough-in |
| Cooktop connection | Below cooktop position (through benchtop or from below) | Electrical rough-in |
| Dishwasher GPO | Inside cabinet next to dishwasher | Electrical rough-in |
| Under-cabinet lighting | Cable run above wall cabinets or through cabinet backs | Electrical rough-in |
| Rangehood connection | Behind rangehood, at correct height | Electrical rough-in |
| Sink waste and water | Below sink position, correct height for trap | Plumbing rough-in |
| Dishwasher water/waste | Adjacent to dishwasher, within reach of hoses | Plumbing rough-in |
| Island bench power | Through slab or floor to island position | BEFORE slab pour or tiling |
| Island bench plumbing | Through slab or floor to island sink position | BEFORE slab pour or tiling |
| Gas line (if gas cooktop) | To cooktop position | Plumbing/gas rough-in |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Kitchen renovation with island bench | "CRITICAL: If your kitchen includes an island bench with power, a sink, or a dishwasher, electrical and plumbing services MUST be run through the floor/slab BEFORE tiling. For concrete slab floors, this is a major coordination item -- services must be chased into or cast into the slab. Confirm island bench position and service requirements with your cabinet maker, electrician, and plumber BEFORE any rough-in work begins." |
| Kitchen cabinetry scope | "COORDINATION WARNING: Your kitchen cabinet layout MUST be finalised before electrical and plumbing rough-in occurs. Provide a dimensioned kitchen plan to your electrician and plumber showing exact GPO positions, appliance locations, and sink/dishwasher positions. Relocating services after cabinets are installed is very expensive ($500-$5,000+)." |
| Electrical rough-in for kitchen | "NOTE: Ensure the kitchen cabinetry plan is provided to the electrician BEFORE rough-in. GPO heights must account for splashback height. Rangehood connection must align with rangehood housing in overhead cabinets. Under-cabinet lighting cables should be roughed-in during this phase." |

## 9.7 Choosing a "Cabinet Maker" Who's Actually Just an Installer Using Flat-Pack

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Some businesses market themselves as "cabinet makers" or "kitchen companies" but do not manufacture any cabinetry. Instead, they order flat-pack cabinets (often imported from China or assembled from budget Australian flat-pack suppliers) and install them. There is nothing inherently wrong with flat-pack kitchens -- but the homeowner should know what they are getting and pay accordingly. The red flag is when a flat-pack installer charges custom cabinet maker prices.

### Impact

- Homeowner pays custom prices ($15,000-$30,000+) for flat-pack quality ($5,000-$10,000 worth of product)
- No custom sizing: flat-pack comes in standard increments (typically 100mm increments), so filler panels are needed for non-standard spaces
- Limited material choices (usually only what the flat-pack supplier stocks)
- Quality of assembly depends entirely on the installer's skill -- a poorly assembled flat-pack kitchen will have misaligned doors, gaps, and squeaky hinges within months
- Warranty may be unclear -- is it the flat-pack supplier's warranty or the installer's?
- Cabinet maker can fix and adjust on-site during install; flat-pack installers are limited by what arrives in the box

### How to Spot a Flat-Pack Installer Posing as a Cabinet Maker

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| Price is significantly lower than other "custom" cabinet maker quotes (30-50% less) | They are likely using budget flat-pack product, not custom-manufacturing |
| No workshop or factory to visit | A genuine cabinet maker has a workshop. If they can't show you where cabinets are made, they don't make them |
| Cannot offer custom sizing (e.g., "we work in 100mm increments") | Standard flat-pack limitation |
| Cannot specify or change hardware brand | They use whatever the flat-pack supplier includes |
| Very short lead time (1-2 weeks) vs industry standard (4-8 weeks) | Flat-pack is off-the-shelf; custom manufacturing takes time |
| Vague about materials when asked | May not know the spec because they didn't manufacture it |
| No trade licence or only a general builder licence | Cabinet making requires a specific licence in most states |

### Questions Homeowners Should Ask

1. "Where are my cabinets manufactured? Can I visit the workshop?"
2. "What carcass material do you use? What thickness?"
3. "What hardware brand do you use for hinges and drawer runners?"
4. "Can you make cabinets to custom sizes (e.g., 437mm wide), or do you work in standard increments?"
5. "Do you spray/paint doors in-house, or are they outsourced?"
6. "What warranty do you provide? Is it your warranty or a third-party supplier's warranty?"
7. "Can I see a kitchen you've completed recently? Can I speak to that client?"

### Cost Comparison: Custom vs Flat-Pack (Standard Kitchen ~4 Linear Metres)

| Component | Flat-Pack (Supply + Install) | Custom Cabinet Maker |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Cabinets (supply) | $3,500 - $8,000 | $10,000 - $20,000 |
| Installation labour | $1,500 - $3,000 | Included in above |
| Filler panels / modifications | $200 - $800 | Minimal (custom-sized) |
| **Total cabinetry** | **$5,200 - $11,800** | **$10,000 - $20,000** |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Cabinetry quote significantly below market | "RED FLAG: This cabinetry quote appears significantly below the typical range for custom cabinetry. Confirm whether the cabinets are custom-manufactured or flat-pack/ready-to-assemble. Both options are valid, but pricing and quality expectations differ significantly. Ask: Where are the cabinets manufactured? What hardware brand is used? Can cabinets be made to custom sizes?" |
| Any cabinetry scope | "RECOMMENDATION: Ask your cabinet maker these key questions: (1) Where are cabinets manufactured? (2) Can I visit the workshop? (3) What hardware brand (hinges, drawer runners)? (4) Can you make custom sizes or only standard increments? (5) What warranty do you provide and who backs it?" |

## 9.8 Not Getting Cabinetry Design Finalised Before Ordering

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners sign off on a cabinetry design and pay a deposit, then want to make changes during or after manufacturing. Unlike many other renovation items, cabinetry cannot easily be modified once manufacturing begins. Materials are cut to specific dimensions, doors are sprayed to specific sizes, and benchtop templating depends on exact cabinet positions.

### Impact

- Changes during manufacturing: additional cost of 10-30% of the affected items, plus time delay
- Changes after delivery: panels may need to be entirely remade (no refund on original)
- 2-pac (polyurethane) doors cannot be resized -- they must be resprayed from scratch
- Engineered stone benchtop cutouts cannot be undone
- Lead time restarts for any remade components (additional 2-6 weeks)
- Design changes cascade: moving one cabinet affects everything adjacent (fillers, benchtop dimensions, splashback, services)

### Common Design Changes That Cause Problems

| Late Design Change | Why It's Expensive |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Can we add a pull-out bin drawer?" | Cabinet internal dimensions may not accommodate it. May need wider cabinet = remaking adjacent panels |
| "Can we change from 600mm oven to 900mm?" | Oven tower must be completely remade. Adjacent cabinets change. Benchtop template changes. |
| "Can we move the sink 300mm to the left?" | Plumbing rough-in is already done. Benchtop cutout position changes. Adjacent cabinet dimensions change. |
| "Can we add an overhead cabinet above the fridge?" | May require structural support. Changes rangehood/vent position. |
| "Can we change door colour from white to charcoal?" | If 2-pac: all doors must be resprayed (entire batch). If laminate: may need to reorder. |
| "Can we make the island 200mm longer?" | Benchtop, cabinetry, kickboards, and potentially floor services all need to change |

### What ScopeAI Flags

|----------------|---------------------|
| Cabinetry design sign-off | "CRITICAL: Finalise your cabinetry design completely before signing off and paying the deposit. Changes after manufacturing begins are very expensive (10-30% surcharge on affected items) and cause significant delays (2-6 weeks for remade components). 'Measure twice, cut once' applies to the entire design -- review every detail including appliance positions, door styles, handle positions, internal accessories, and benchtop profile before approving." |
| Cabinetry order placed | "IMPORTANT: Once the cabinetry order is placed and manufacturing begins, design changes will incur additional costs. Confirm the following are exactly as you want them BEFORE sign-off: (1) All cabinet dimensions and positions, (2) Door material, colour, and profile, (3) Handle style and drilling positions, (4) Internal accessories (pull-out bins, lazy susans, spice racks), (5) Benchtop edge profile and any waterfall ends, (6) Appliance makes and models (for correct openings)." |

## 9.9 Not Checking Licensing and Insurance

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners hire carpenters or cabinet makers without verifying their licence or insurance. In Australia, carpentry and cabinet making are licensed trades in most states. Unlicensed operators may do poor-quality work, may not comply with building codes, and leave the homeowner exposed to significant financial and legal risk.

### Impact

- Work may not comply with the Building Code of Australia (BCA/NCC)
- Home insurance may not cover damage caused by unlicensed work
- No warranty protection -- if unlicensed operator disappears, homeowner has no recourse
- If selling the property, building certifiers or conveyancers may flag non-compliant work
- In some states, the homeowner can be fined for engaging unlicensed contractors for work above certain thresholds

### Licensing Requirements by State

| State | Licensing Authority | Carpentry/Joinery Licence Required? | Key Threshold |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|
| **NSW** | NSW Fair Trading | Yes -- must hold appropriate contractor licence | Work over $5,000 requires a licence |
| **VIC** | Victorian Building Authority (VBA) | Yes -- registered building practitioner for structural carpentry. Cabinet makers require different registration | Domestic building work over $16,000 requires registration + domestic building insurance |
| **QLD** | QBCC (Queensland Building and Construction Commission) | Yes -- QBCC licence required | All building work requires a QBCC licence |
| **WA** | Building Services Board | Yes -- registered builder or trade contractor | Building work generally requires registration |
| **SA** | Consumer and Business Services SA | Yes -- building work licence | Licensed for work over prescribed thresholds |

### Insurance Requirements

| Insurance Type | Minimum Recommended | Why It Matters |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Public Liability** | $5,000,000 (minimum); $10M-$20M preferred | Covers injury or property damage caused by the tradesperson's work |
| **Workers Compensation** | Mandatory if employing staff | Covers injuries to the tradesperson's employees on your property |
| **Domestic Building Insurance** (VIC) / **Home Warranty Insurance** (NSW, QLD) | Required for work above state thresholds | Protects homeowner if builder/tradesperson dies, disappears, or becomes insolvent before completing or rectifying work |
| **Contract Works Insurance** | Recommended for major renovations | Covers loss or damage to materials and work during construction |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Any carpentry/joinery scope | "CHECKLIST: Before engaging a carpenter or cabinet maker, verify: (1) Appropriate trade licence for your state -- ask for licence number and verify online at your state's licensing authority website, (2) Current public liability insurance (minimum $5M -- ask for a Certificate of Currency), (3) Workers compensation insurance (if they employ staff), (4) Domestic building insurance / home warranty insurance if required by your state for the value of work." |
| High-value cabinetry work (over $16,000) | "IMPORTANT: In most Australian states, carpentry and cabinetry work above certain thresholds requires the tradesperson to hold a specific licence and provide home warranty/domestic building insurance. Verify this BEFORE signing a contract." |

## 9.10 Verbal Agreements Instead of Written Scope

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners rely on verbal discussions and handshake agreements with carpenters and cabinet makers instead of insisting on a detailed written scope of works. "We talked about it and agreed on everything" is not a scope. Without a written document specifying exactly what is included, what is excluded, what materials will be used, and what the payment terms are, disputes are inevitable.

### Impact

- No legal protection if work is not completed or not completed to standard
- "I thought that was included" disputes are the number one cause of renovation conflict
- No basis for comparison between quotes (each tradesperson interpreted the job differently)
- No reference document for variations -- any change becomes a he-said-she-said argument
- Difficult to enforce warranty claims without a written specification
- Impossible to pursue through NCAT, QCAT, VCAT, or other state tribunals without written evidence

### What a Written Scope Must Include for Carpentry/Joinery

| Element | Why It's Essential |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Detailed description of work** | What exactly will be built, installed, or modified |
| **Materials specification** | Carcass material, door material, hardware brand, benchtop material |
| **Dimensions** | Cabinet sizes, heights, depths -- reference to a dimensioned drawing |
| **Inclusions list** | Every item that IS included in the price |
| **Exclusions list** | Every item that is NOT included (and why) |
| **PC sums and allowances** | For items not yet selected (handles, fittings, accessories) |
| **Timeline** | Start date, key milestones, expected completion date |
| **Payment schedule** | Deposit amount, progress payments, final payment terms |
| **Variation process** | How changes are requested, approved, and priced |
| **Warranty** | Duration, what's covered, what's not |
| **Dispute resolution** | How disputes will be handled (e.g., mediation, state tribunal) |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| All carpentry/joinery scopes | "ESSENTIAL: Ensure your agreement with the carpenter/cabinet maker is in writing and includes: detailed work description, material specifications (carcass, doors, hardware brand), dimensioned drawings, inclusions list, exclusions list, PC sums for unselected items, timeline, payment schedule, variation process, and warranty terms. Verbal agreements provide no legal protection." |
| Before signing contract | "RECOMMENDATION: For work valued over $5,000, use a formal building contract (HIA, MBA, or equivalent) rather than just a quote. A contract provides stronger legal protection including cooling-off periods, variation processes, and dispute resolution pathways." |

## 9.11 Not Understanding the Difference Between Carpenter and Cabinet Maker

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners use the terms "carpenter" and "cabinet maker" interchangeably. They are different trades with different skill sets, tools, licences, and specialisations. Hiring the wrong trade for the job results in poor outcomes.

### Impact

- A carpenter hired to build a kitchen will produce a functional but often rough-quality result (carpentry joints, not cabinetry joints)
- A cabinet maker hired to do structural framing is working outside their expertise
- Licensing issues: in some states, the licence categories are different
- The quality of fit and finish differs significantly between a site-built carpenter's kitchen and a factory-manufactured cabinet maker's kitchen

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Carpenter | Cabinet Maker (Joiner) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Primary work** | Structural framing, roof framing, floor framing, door/window installation, architraves, skirting boards, decking, pergolas, stairs | Kitchen cabinetry, bathroom vanities, built-in wardrobes, entertainment units, laundry cabinetry, custom joinery |
| **Where work happens** | Primarily on-site | Primarily in workshop/factory, with installation on-site |
| **Tools** | Nail guns, circular saws, levels, chalk lines | CNC machines, edge banders, spray booths, panel saws |
| **Precision** | Construction-grade (tolerances 1-3mm typical) | Joinery-grade (tolerances 0.5-1mm typical) |
| **Materials** | Structural timber (pine, hardwood), plywood, LVL, steel connectors | Board products (MDF, HMR, plywood), laminates, 2-pac finishes, solid timber veneers |
| **Licence (example: NSW)** | Carpentry contractor licence | Joinery contractor licence (separate category) |
| **Typical projects** | New home frame, renovation structural work, decks, pergolas, door hanging, trim carpentry | Kitchens, vanities, wardrobes, study desks, entertainment units, laundry cabinets |

### When You Need Which Trade

| Job | Trade Needed |
|-----|-------------|
| New kitchen cabinetry | Cabinet maker |
| Built-in wardrobe | Cabinet maker |
| Bathroom vanity | Cabinet maker |
| Hanging a new door | Carpenter |
| Installing architraves and skirting boards | Carpenter |
| Building a deck or pergola | Carpenter |
| Structural wall framing | Carpenter |
| Custom bookshelf (built-in) | Cabinet maker or finish carpenter |
| Staircase | Specialist stair builder or carpenter |
| Window and door frames | Carpenter |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Cabinetry work in scope | "NOTE: Kitchen cabinetry, vanities, and built-in wardrobes should be manufactured and installed by a qualified cabinet maker (joiner), not a general carpenter. Cabinet makers work to finer tolerances and use specialised equipment (CNC machines, edge banders, spray booths). Ensure your tradesperson holds the appropriate licence category for the work being performed." |
| Structural carpentry in scope | "NOTE: Framing, decking, pergolas, and structural timber work require a qualified carpenter. This is different from a cabinet maker. Ensure the tradesperson holds the appropriate licence for the type of work." |
| Mixed scope (cabinetry + carpentry) | "REMINDER: This scope includes both cabinetry work (cabinet maker trade) and general carpentry work (carpenter trade). These are different trades and may require different tradespeople. Some tradespeople hold both licences -- confirm this before engaging." |

## 9.12 Ignoring Moisture Requirements in Wet Areas

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners (and some budget tradespeople) use standard MDF or particleboard in wet areas -- bathrooms, laundries, and even kitchen kickboard areas near the floor. Standard board products absorb moisture, swell, delaminate, and fail. This is one of the most common causes of cabinetry failure in Australian homes.

### Impact

- Vanity carcass swells and disintegrates within 1-3 years
- Kitchen kickboards swell from mopping water, becoming unsightly and structural failures
- Cabinet shelves under sinks warp and delaminate from plumbing leaks
- Laundry cabinets near washing machine fail from humidity and splashing
- Entire vanity or cabinet run may need replacement -- not repairable
- Mould growth inside swollen board products creates health concerns

### Material Requirements by Area

| Location | Minimum Material Requirement | Best Practice |
|----------|----------------------------|---------------|
| **Bathroom vanity carcass** | MR (Moisture Resistant) MDF or HMR particleboard | Marine plywood or HMR board with fully sealed edges |
| **Bathroom vanity doors** | MR MDF (if painted) or laminate on MR substrate | 2-pac on MR MDF or solid surface |
| **Kitchen kickboards** | MR MDF minimum | Aluminium kickboard or stainless steel (best) |
| **Under-sink cabinet base** | MR MDF with sealed edges and waterproof mat | Marine plywood shelf with silicone-sealed edges |
| **Laundry cabinets** | MR MDF or HMR board | Same as bathroom -- treat as wet area |
| **Kitchen carcass (general)** | Standard HMR board (recommended) | HMR board is now industry standard for quality kitchens |
| **Outdoor kitchen/BBQ area** | Marine plywood or aluminium | No MDF or particleboard products outdoors |

### What MR / HMR Means

| Abbreviation | Full Name | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **MDF** | Medium Density Fibreboard | Standard board product. NOT moisture resistant. Swells rapidly when wet. |
| **MR MDF** | Moisture Resistant MDF | MDF manufactured with water-resistant resin. Green-dyed core for identification. Resists humidity but is NOT waterproof. |
| **HMR** | High Moisture Resistant (particleboard) | Particleboard with moisture-resistant resin and wax additives. Green core. Industry standard for quality kitchen carcasses in Australia. |
| **Marine Ply** | Marine-grade plywood | Waterproof glue, void-free veneers. Suitable for wet areas and outdoor applications. More expensive. |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Bathroom vanity in scope | "CRITICAL: Bathroom vanity cabinetry MUST use moisture-resistant (MR) or high moisture resistant (HMR) board for the carcass. Standard MDF or particleboard will swell and fail in a bathroom environment. Specify MR MDF or HMR board in your scope and confirm this with your cabinet maker." |
| Kitchen cabinetry in scope | "NOTE: Specify HMR (High Moisture Resistant) board for kitchen carcasses and MR MDF or aluminium for kitchen kickboards. Kitchen kickboards are exposed to mopping water and must be moisture resistant. Under-sink shelves should be MR board with sealed edges." |
| Laundry cabinetry in scope | "NOTE: Laundry cabinetry should be treated as wet-area cabinetry. Specify MR MDF or HMR board for carcasses and moisture-resistant doors. Standard MDF will fail from humidity and water splashing." |
| Outdoor kitchen/BBQ area | "WARNING: Standard MDF and particleboard products are NOT suitable for outdoor use. Outdoor kitchen cabinetry must use marine-grade plywood, aluminium, or stainless steel construction." |

## 9.13 Not Allowing for Site Access and Delivery

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Large assembled cabinets need clear physical access to get from the delivery truck to the installation location. Homeowners -- particularly in apartments, townhouses, and older/heritage homes -- often don't consider how cabinets will physically get into the space.

### Impact

- Cabinets too large to fit through doorways, hallways, or lifts
- Cabinet maker must disassemble and reassemble on-site (extra labour, potential damage)
- Apartment buildings require building management approval, lift booking, loading dock access -- all with specific time windows
- Heritage homes with narrow hallways and low door frames may require cabinets in smaller sections
- Delivery vehicle access: some streets have no truck parking, narrow lanes, or weight limits
- Failed delivery = storage costs + redelivery charges ($200-$500+)

### Common Access Issues by Property Type

| Property Type | Common Access Issues | Mitigation |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Apartment (high-rise)** | Lift size (standard residential lift ~800mm x 1400mm internal), loading dock booking, building management rules, restricted delivery hours, floor protection requirements | Measure lift internal dimensions. Book goods lift. Confirm delivery window with body corporate. Cabinet maker to design panels to fit lift. |
| **Apartment (walk-up)** | Narrow stairwells, tight landings, no lift | Cabinet maker to design in sections that can be carried up stairs. Additional labour cost. |
| **Townhouse** | Narrow internal hallways, tight turns, garage access only | Confirm widest pathway from truck to kitchen. May need to remove front door temporarily. |
| **Heritage home** | Low door frames, narrow hallways, narrow stairs, heritage-listed features that cannot be scratched | Floor and door frame protection. Cabinets in smaller sections. Extra care required. |
| **Rural/remote** | Distance from manufacturer, unsealed roads, no crane access | Confirm delivery logistics and costs upfront. Delivery surcharge likely. |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Apartment renovation | "ACCESS WARNING: Confirm the following with your cabinet maker and building management BEFORE ordering: (1) Goods lift internal dimensions (if applicable), (2) Building management delivery rules (permitted hours, floor protection, insurance requirements), (3) Loading dock or street-level access for delivery truck, (4) Maximum panel/cabinet size that can fit through lift and hallways. Cabinet maker should design cabinetry in sections that fit through available access routes." |
| Any cabinetry delivery | "NOTE: Ensure clear and adequate access from the delivery point (truck/van) to the installation area. Remove any obstacles from hallways and doorways. Protect floors and walls along the delivery path. Confirm delivery logistics with your cabinet maker at the time of order -- not on delivery day." |
| Heritage or older home | "ACCESS NOTE: Older and heritage homes often have narrow hallways, low door frames, and tight internal spaces. Confirm maximum cabinet section sizes with your cabinet maker to ensure they can physically be brought into the property without damage to the home or the cabinetry." |

## 9.14 Choosing the Cheapest Quote Without Understanding What Is Excluded

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners compare cabinetry quotes purely on bottom-line price without analysing what each quote includes and excludes. The cheapest quote almost always excludes the most items -- making it appear cheaper but actually costing the same or more once all the add-ons are accounted for.

### Impact

- Budget blowout when excluded items are added back in
- Inferior materials used to hit the low price point
- Critical items missing from scope (handles, soft-close hardware, internal accessories, benchtop, etc.)
- Disputes during installation when homeowner assumes items are included that were never quoted
- The "cheap" kitchen ends up costing the same as the mid-range quote, but with worse materials

### How to Compare Quotes Like-for-Like

| Comparison Point | What to Check | Red Flag If Missing |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Carcass material** | Board type and thickness (e.g., 18mm HMR) | Quote says "melamine" without specifying MR/HMR or thickness |
| **Door material** | Exact finish (2-pac, laminate brand/colour, thermolaminate, timber veneer) | Quote says "white doors" without specifying material type |
| **Hardware** | Brand name for hinges and drawer runners (e.g., Blum, Hettich) | Quote says "soft-close" without specifying brand |
| **Handles** | Included or excluded? If PC sum, what allowance per handle? | Not mentioned at all |
| **Benchtop** | Included or excluded? If included, what material and edge profile? | Not mentioned or says "benchtop extra" without guidance on cost |
| **Internal accessories** | Pull-out bins, lazy susans, spice racks, cutlery inserts -- included or PC sums? | Not mentioned |
| **Kickboards** | Included? What material? | Not mentioned |
| **Installation** | Included? How many days allowed? What if it takes longer? | Not mentioned or says "installation extra" |
| **Demolition/removal** | Old kitchen removal included? | Not mentioned |
| **Delivery** | Delivery to site included? Any surcharges? | Not mentioned |
| **Splashback** | Included or excluded? | Not mentioned |

### Quote Comparison Template (for ScopeAI to Generate)

| Item | Quote A | Quote B | Quote C |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Multiple quotes being compared | "IMPORTANT: Do not compare cabinetry quotes on price alone. The cheapest quote often excludes the most items. Use the comparison checklist to ensure you are comparing like-for-like: same carcass material, same door material, same hardware brand, same inclusions. A $12,000 quote that includes handles, soft-close hardware, and delivery may be better value than a $9,000 quote that excludes all three." |
| Any cabinetry quote review | "CHECKLIST: When reviewing a cabinetry quote, confirm it specifies: (1) Carcass material and thickness, (2) Door material and finish, (3) Hardware brand for hinges and drawer runners, (4) Whether handles are included (and what allowance), (5) Whether benchtop is included, (6) Whether installation is included, (7) Whether old kitchen removal is included, (8) Warranty terms." |

## 9.15 Not Considering Future Maintenance

**Confidence:** HIGH

### The Problem

Homeowners choose cabinetry finishes and materials based solely on appearance and initial cost, without considering what happens when the kitchen is 5, 10, or 15 years old and needs maintenance or repairs. Different finishes have very different maintenance profiles, repairability, and lifespans.

### Impact

- 2-pac doors that get damaged cannot be touched up effectively -- entire doors must be resprayed (cost: $150-$400 per door)
- Laminate doors that chip at the edge cannot be repaired -- the door must be replaced
- Timber doors that are not periodically oiled or sealed will dry out, crack, or discolour
- Budget hardware (hinges, drawer runners) fails within 3-5 years, requiring replacement of the entire mechanism
- Stone benchtops that are not sealed regularly stain permanently
- Thermolaminated (vinyl wrap) doors can peel at the edges in high-heat areas (near ovens, cooktops)

### Finish Comparison: Maintenance and Longevity

| Door Finish | Lifespan | Maintenance Required | Repairability | Heat Resistance | Moisture Resistance | Cost Level |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------| -----------|
| **2-pac (polyurethane)** | 15-25 years | Wipe clean. Avoid harsh chemicals. | Small nicks can be touched up with touch-up paint; larger damage requires full respray of the door panel | Good | Excellent | $$$$ |
| **Laminate (HPL)** | 15-20 years | Wipe clean. Very low maintenance. | Edge chips cannot be repaired -- door must be replaced. Surface scratches cannot be removed. | Good | Good |  $$ |
| **Thermolaminate (vinyl wrap)** | 8-15 years | Wipe clean. Avoid excessive heat near edges. | Peeling edges cannot be re-glued effectively -- door must be replaced. | Poor (peels near heat sources) | Fair | $ |
| **Timber veneer** | 15-25 years | Periodic oiling/sealing (every 1-2 years). Avoid water pooling. | Can be lightly sanded and re-oiled for minor damage. Major damage may require re-veneering. | Fair | Fair (if properly sealed) | $$$$ |
| **Solid timber** | 20-30+ years | Periodic oiling/sealing (every 1-2 years). Will develop natural patina. | Can be sanded, refinished, and repaired. Most repairable option. | Fair | Fair (if properly sealed) | $$$$$ |
| **Acrylic (high-gloss)** | 10-15 years | Fingerprint magnet -- requires frequent wiping. Scratches easily. | Scratches and chips cannot be repaired -- door must be replaced. | Fair | Good | $$$ |

### Hardware Longevity

| Hardware Quality | Expected Lifespan | Cycle Rating | Brands |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Budget/unbranded** | 3-5 years | 20,000-40,000 cycles | No-name imports |
| **Mid-range** | 8-12 years | 40,000-80,000 cycles | Hettich standard range, King Slide |
| **Premium** | 15-25+ years | 80,000-200,000 cycles | Blum BLUMOTION, Hettich Silent System, Grass |

### What ScopeAI Flags

| Warning Trigger | ScopeAI Warning Text |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Door finish selection | "MAINTENANCE NOTE: Consider the long-term maintenance and repairability of your chosen door finish. 2-pac (polyurethane) offers a premium look but damaged doors cannot be easily touched up -- they must be resprayed or replaced ($150-$400 per door). Laminate is extremely durable but edge chips cannot be repaired. Thermolaminate (vinyl wrap) is budget-friendly but can peel near heat sources (ovens, cooktops). Timber veneer and solid timber can be sanded and refinished but require periodic oiling." |
| Hardware specification | "LONGEVITY NOTE: Quality hardware (hinges and drawer runners) directly affects how long your kitchen functions well. Premium hardware (Blum, Hettich, Grass) is rated for 80,000-200,000 cycles and typically lasts 15-25 years. Budget hardware may fail within 3-5 years, requiring replacement. The cost difference at installation is modest ($5-$15 per hinge) but the longevity difference is significant." |
| Any kitchen scope | "FUTURE MAINTENANCE: Ask your cabinet maker about the maintenance requirements for your selected finishes. Key questions: (1) How do I clean these doors? (2) What happens if a door is damaged -- can it be repaired or must it be replaced? (3) What is the warranty period for the finish? (4) What is the warranty period for the hardware?" |

## MASTER WARNING LIST FOR AI SYSTEM PROMPT

The following is a consolidated list of all warnings ScopeAI should consider generating when processing a carpentry/joinery scope:

### Before Design Sign-Off
1. Confirm all appliance makes, models, and dimensions before finalising cabinet design
2. Finalise cabinet design completely before ordering -- changes after manufacturing are very expensive
3. Confirm handle style and drilling positions before door manufacturing
4. Confirm benchtop edge profile and any waterfall ends before ordering

### Before Ordering Cabinetry
5. Verify cabinet maker's licence and insurance (licence number, public liability $5M+)
6. Ensure agreement is in writing with detailed specifications (not verbal)
7. Confirm carcass material, door material, and hardware brand in writing
8. Confirm whether handles, benchtop, installation, delivery, and demolition are included or excluded
9. Confirm manufacturing lead time and build it into the renovation schedule
10. Confirm site access requirements for delivery

### Before Electrical/Plumbing Rough-In
11. Provide finalised kitchen plan to electrician and plumber BEFORE rough-in
12. Confirm island bench service locations in the slab/floor BEFORE tiling
13. Confirm GPO heights relative to splashback and cabinet layout
14. Confirm rangehood duct position relative to overhead cabinetry

### Material Specifications
15. Specify MR/HMR board for bathroom, laundry, and kitchen kickboard areas
16. Specify hardware brand (not just "soft-close")
17. Consider long-term maintenance profile of chosen door finish
18. Specify moisture-resistant kickboards in kitchen

### Quote Review
19. Compare quotes like-for-like using the comparison checklist
20. Do not assume the cheapest quote is the best value -- check exclusions
21. Verify whether the "cabinet maker" actually manufactures or assembles flat-pack
22. Ensure the quote includes a clear warranty (workmanship + materials)
