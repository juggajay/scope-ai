# Benchtop Coordination Research -- Carpentry & Cabinet Making

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive, field-accurate reference data for the ScopeAI system prompt engine. This document covers the coordination between cabinet makers, stone masons, and other trades during benchtop supply, preparation, templating, and installation in Australian residential construction.
**Confidence Note:** Content is synthesised from Australian manufacturer specifications (Laminex, Polytec, Cosentino/Dekton), stone fabricator published guidelines (AB Stone, Deluxe Stone, Made in Stone, Inform Stone), industry forums (Whirlpool, HomeOne), and supplier technical documents. All dimensions, tolerances, and processes reflect current Australian trade practice as of early 2026. Where variance exists between sources, the most commonly cited figure is used and noted.

## 1. Cabinet Maker's Responsibilities for Stone Benchtop Preparation

The cabinet maker is responsible for delivering a cabinet installation that is ready to receive a stone template. The stone fabricator will not proceed with templating until the following conditions are met.

### 1.1 Cabinets Installed, Level, and Secured

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Wall cabinets bolted to wall | All base cabinets must be permanently fixed to the wall using appropriate fasteners into studs or masonry |
| Island cabinets fixed to floor | Island base units must be firmly secured to the floor; stone has only a 2 mm tolerance for level |
| Level tolerance | Cabinets must be level to within 2 mm across entire run; stone fabricators will reject templating if cabinets are not level |
| No movement permitted | Nothing can change or move between the template visit and the installation visit |
| Plumbing and electrical roughed in | All services within the cabinet zone (water supply, waste, gas, power) must be roughed in and accessible before template |

### 1.2 Substrate and Support Rails

| Item | Specification |
|---|---|
| Substrate material | 16 mm or 18 mm MDF or moisture-resistant particleboard |
| Substrate purpose | Provides a flat, continuous bearing surface for stone; distributes load; allows shimming |
| Substrate offset from finished edge | 25 mm inset for mitred edges; 45 mm inset for laminated (built-up) edges |
| Substrate for 40 mm mitred edges | 26 mm thick substrate required (8 mm thicker than standard 18 mm) |
| Support rails at appliance openings | A rail must be installed on the edge, front, and back of openings for cooktops, sinks, and underbench dishwashers |
| Maximum unsupported span | 600 mm between supports; back-to-front supports must be fabricated every 600 mm |
| Substrate installation method | Secured to cabinet carcass from beneath using small L-brackets; this allows removal of stone and substrate without damaging the carcass |

### 1.3 Cut-Outs Marked or Templated

| Cut-Out Type | Minimum Clearance from Front Edge | Minimum Clearance from Rear Edge | Minimum Between Cut-Outs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sink | 80 mm | 50 mm | 50 mm |
| Cooktop / hotplate | 80 mm | 50 mm | 50 mm |
| Tap hole to sink cut-out | -- | -- | 35 mm minimum |

- All cut-outs for sinks, cooktops, tap holes, and waste holes must be made in the substrate before stone installation.
- Undermount sinks should be recessed into the substrate, allowing 5 mm movement clearance in all directions.
- Sink and cooktop models must be physically on site or exact specification sheets provided at template.

### 1.4 Shimming and Levelling

- Shims (plastic packers) are used between cabinet tops and substrate to achieve the 2 mm level tolerance.
- Shimming is the cabinet maker's responsibility, not the stone mason's.
- Check level front-to-back and left-to-right across the entire run.
- Re-check after securing substrate -- tightening can pull the substrate out of level.

### 1.5 Bracing and Support for Overhangs

| Overhang Distance | Support Required (20 mm stone) |
|---|---|
| 0--150 mm | No additional support needed; stone sits on cabinet carcass |
| 150--300 mm | 18 mm substrate at maximum 600 mm intervals |
| 300--500 mm | Steel brackets or metal support frame required (installed by cabinet maker or builder) |
| Over 500 mm | Legs, columns, or structural panels required |

- For 12 mm porcelain/Dekton panels, maximum unsupported overhang is only 150 mm.
- Breakfast bar overhangs (typically 300--450 mm) almost always require steel brackets.
- Bracket spacing: maximum 600 mm centres.

### 1.6 Island Bench Preparation

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Fixing | Both island cabinets firmly secured to floor (screwed through base rail into floor or concrete anchors) |
| Level | Must meet the same 2 mm tolerance as wall-run cabinets |
| Services | All plumbing (water supply, waste), gas, and electrical must be roughed in and accessible from within the cabinet before template |
| Substrate | Full substrate across island top; support rails at all cut-out perimeters |
| Waterfall ends | If waterfall stone ends are specified, cabinet end panel must be plumb and the flooring situation must be confirmed (see Section 6) |
| Access | Adequate access to island location for stone delivery -- panels can weigh 80--120 kg |

---

## 2. Template Coordination Process

### 2.1 Who Templates?

The stone fabricator (stone mason) performs the templating. This is not the cabinet maker's responsibility. The fabricator sends a specialist templater to site.

### 2.2 Templating Methods

| Method | Description | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| Digital / laser templating | Laser measuring device captures exact dimensions digitally; highest accuracy | Standard for most fabricators; preferred method |
| Manual MDF templating | 3--4 mm MDF sheets cut to exact size and shape; cut-outs for sink, cooktop, tap holes marked on template | Complex layouts; some regional fabricators; used as a physical check before cutting |

### 2.3 When Does Templating Happen?

Templating occurs **after** all of the following are complete:

1. All base cabinets installed, levelled, and permanently fixed
2. Substrate installed and level-checked
3. All existing benchtops removed (renovation projects)
4. Splashback tiles NOT yet installed (template must happen before tiling if tiling to underside of overhead cabinets)
5. Sink, cooktop, and tap models confirmed and ideally on site

### 2.4 Template to Installation Timeline

| Stage | Typical Duration |
|---|---|
| Notice required before template date | Minimum 2 weeks' advance booking |
| Template visit duration | 2--3 hours on site |
| Fabrication -- 20 mm benchtops | 3--5 business days (some fabricators) |
| Fabrication -- 40 mm benchtops | 5--7 business days |
| Fabrication -- general / complex jobs | 6--10 business days |
| Fabrication -- natural stone (granite, marble) | 10--15 business days |
| Installation visit | 1 day (standard kitchen); up to 2 days (large/complex) |
| **Total: template to installed** | **Typically 5--15 business days** |

**Critical note:** Some fabricators offer rush turnaround (3 days for 20 mm), but this usually incurs a surcharge and must be arranged at quoting stage.

### 2.5 What Must Be Confirmed Before Template

| Item | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Sink model and exact dimensions | Cut-out size, undermount clip positions, and drain location are sink-specific |
| Cooktop model and exact dimensions | Cut-out size and minimum clearances vary between brands/models |
| Tap hole positions and diameter | Number of holes, spacing, and diameter must be marked |
| Water filter tap (if applicable) | Additional hole required; position relative to main tap |
| Edge profile selection | Affects substrate offset and fabrication |
| Stone colour and finish | Must be locked in; cannot be changed after fabrication begins |
| Overhang dimensions | Exact measurements for breakfast bars, island overhangs |
| Splashback type | Upstand (60--150 mm, supplied by stone mason) vs full-height (tiled or stone, different interface detail) |

---

## 3. Laminate Benchtops -- Supply and Install by Cabinet Maker

Laminate benchtops are typically supplied and installed by the cabinet maker (not a separate stone mason). This makes them simpler from a coordination standpoint.

### 3.1 Standard Specifications

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| Substrate | High-moisture-resistant (HMR) particleboard or MDF |
| Standard finished thickness | 33 mm (with rolled/postform front edge); some square-edge profiles at 33 mm or 39 mm |
| Depth | Standard 600 mm; island benchtops may be deeper |
| Major Australian brands | Laminex, Polytec, Formica, Duropal, Wilsonart |
| Silica content | Laminex products are silica-free |

### 3.2 Edge Profiles

| Edge Profile | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Postform / rolled edge | Laminate wraps continuously over the front edge in a smooth curve (D-roll or bullnose); eliminates the visible join line on the face edge | Traditional, cost-effective; limited colour range compared to square edge |
| Square edge | 90-degree perpendicular edge; laminate is flat on top, ABS or matching laminate strip applied to the face | Modern, clean look; visible edge band line |
| ABS edge (1 mm or 2 mm) | Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene plastic banding; impact-resistant, heat-tolerant, available in matching or contrasting colours | Most common modern edge; easy to replace if damaged |
| Digital ABS edge | Printed ABS that replicates the stone/timber pattern of the top surface onto the edge | Creates a more realistic, slab-like appearance |
| InvisiEdge ABS | Pre-applied functional layer creating a seamless look | Premium option from Laminex |
| Pencil round / eased edge | Slight rounding of the square edge | Softens the look without a full roll |

### 3.3 Joins

| Join Method | Description |
|---|---|
| Mason's mitre | A hybrid joint: 45-degree mitred section for the first 30--40 mm of the benchtop depth, transitioning into a straight butt joint for the remainder; uses biscuits and colour-matched adhesive for alignment and strength |
| Butt joint with colour-matched compound | Straight butt joint sealed with colour-matched jointing compound; simpler but more visible |
| Dogleg / L-shaped joins | Mason's mitre is the standard method for L-shaped or U-shaped kitchen layouts |

### 3.4 Sink Integration with Laminate

| Sink Type | Suitability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Top-mount / drop-in | Recommended | Standard approach; sink lip sits on top of laminate, creating a seal |
| Undermount | Not generally recommended | Exposed particleboard edge at cut-out is highly vulnerable to moisture; water ingress causes swelling and delamination |
| Undermount with specialist system | Possible (e.g., Karran sinks) | Uses methyl methacrylate two-part acrylic adhesive to create a watertight bond; must be purpose-designed system; not standard practice in Australia |
| Flush-mount / inset | Possible with care | Requires precise cut-out and good sealing |

**Key warning for Scope of Works:** Undermount sinks with standard laminate benchtops are a known moisture failure point. If the client wants an undermount sink, recommend stone or solid-surface benchtop material instead.

### 3.5 Cost Comparison

| Benchtop Material | Indicative Cost per Square Metre (AUD, installed) |
|---|---|
| Laminate (budget) | $120--$250 |
| Laminate (mid-range / premium) | $250--$440 |
| Engineered stone (Caesarstone, Smartstone) | $500--$1,200 |
| Natural stone (granite) | $700--$1,700 |
| Natural stone (marble) | $800--$2,200 |
| Dekton / porcelain | $600--$1,500 |

Laminate is 60--80% cheaper than engineered stone for the same lineal run.

## 4. Timber Benchtops -- Supply and Install by Carpenter / Cabinet Maker

Timber benchtops are typically supplied and installed by the cabinet maker or a specialist timber benchtop supplier. They require specific sealing and ongoing maintenance.

### 4.1 Popular Species (Australian Market)

| Species | Janka Hardness (approx.) | Colour / Character | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blackbutt | 9.1 kN | Pale brown to golden honey | Strong, reliable; one of the most popular choices |
| Spotted Gum | 11.0 kN | Brown with distinctive grain figure | Very hard; excellent durability |
| Tasmanian Oak | 6.0 kN | Warm pink to honey tones; fine, even grain | Softer than Blackbutt; more affordable |
| American Oak | 6.0 kN | Light golden; consistent grain | Popular for modern/Scandi-style kitchens |
| Walnut | 4.5 kN | Dark chocolate brown | Softer; requires more care; premium aesthetic |
| Recycled / reclaimed timber | Varies | Character grain, nail holes, patina | Sustainable option; variable quality; requires careful selection |
| Jarrah | 8.5 kN | Rich red-brown | High-end; distinctive Australian hardwood |

### 4.2 Thickness and Dimensions

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| Common thicknesses | 20 mm, 32 mm, 38 mm, 40 mm, 42 mm |
| Most popular thickness | 40 mm (substantial feel; allows for undermount sink cut-outs with sufficient edge strength) |
| Standard depth | 600 mm (matching cabinet depth); custom depths available |
| Laminated construction | Multiple boards edge-glued together; lamination widths of 20 mm, 60 mm, or 90 mm depending on look desired |

### 4.3 Sealing Options

| Finish Type | Product Examples | Food Safe | Durability | Maintenance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hardwax oil | Rubio Monocoat Oil Plus 2C, Osmo 2K Wood Oil | Yes (certified food-safe after curing) | Moderate; needs periodic re-oiling | Re-oil every 3--6 months in high-use areas; easy spot repair |
| Polyurethane (2-pac) | Various 2-pac polyurethane systems | Yes (once fully cured) | High; waterproof, scratch-resistant | More difficult to repair; full re-sand and re-coat required |
| Natural oil | Tung oil, Danish oil | Yes (pure versions) | Low--moderate; needs frequent re-application | Re-oil every 1--3 months |

**Critical sealing requirement:** Timber benchtops must be envelope-sealed -- top, bottom, edges, and ends. Pay particular attention to:
- Cut-outs (sink, cooktop) -- especially the exposed end grain
- If cut on site, the cut area must be resealed with at least 4 coats of sealer
- Unsealed end grain will absorb moisture rapidly, causing swelling, cupping, and cracking

### 4.4 Rubio Monocoat Specifics (Most Common Hardwax Oil in Australia)

- Oil Plus 2C: 0% VOC; food-safe certified; Red List Free
- Single-coat application (molecular bonding -- only the first coat penetrates)
- Curing time: surface dry in 24--36 hours; full cure at 5 days
- Maintenance: wipe with damp cloth and mild soap; re-oil high-wear areas every 3--6 months with Rubio Monocoat Refresh Eco or a thin re-application of Oil Plus 2C
- Available through specialist timber suppliers in Australia

### 4.5 Sink Integration with Timber

| Sink Type | Suitability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Top-mount / drop-in | Suitable | Standard approach; ensure cut-out edges are sealed (4+ coats) |
| Undermount | Suitable with proper sealing | Timber thickness (40 mm) provides sufficient material for undermount clips; all cut-out surfaces must be thoroughly sealed including end grain |
| Butler / Belfast sink | Common combination | Sink sits below bench level; front apron exposed; timber bench cut-out edges must be sealed |

### 4.6 Heat and Moisture Concerns

| Concern | Detail | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Hot pots/pans | Will scorch unprotected timber | Always use trivets; oil finishes are more forgiving than polyurethane (scorch can be sanded out and re-oiled) |
| Standing water | Will penetrate oil finishes if left for extended periods | Wipe up standing water immediately; ensure sink area is well-sealed |
| Steam from kettle/dishwasher | Repeated steam exposure degrades finish | Position kettle/dishwasher away from unsealed edges; ensure splashback interface is sealed |
| Seasonal movement | Timber expands/contracts with humidity changes | Allow 2--3 mm expansion gap at walls; use slotted screw holes for fixing to cabinets |

### 4.7 Homeowner Maintenance Guide (Include in Scope of Works)

1. Wipe up spills immediately -- do not let liquids sit on the surface
2. Use cutting boards -- do not cut directly on the benchtop
3. Use trivets for hot items -- never place hot pots or pans directly on timber
4. Clean with a damp cloth and mild soap; avoid harsh chemicals
5. Re-oil every 3--6 months with the specified product (Rubio Monocoat Oil Plus 2C or Osmo)
6. If water no longer beads on the surface, it is time to re-oil
7. Minor scratches and marks can be sanded out locally and re-oiled without refinishing the entire benchtop

## 5. Substrate Requirements by Benchtop Material

| Benchtop Material | Substrate Required? | Substrate Type | Additional Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engineered stone (20 mm)** | Yes (for overhangs >150 mm) | 18 mm MDF or HMR particleboard | Sits on cabinet carcass top; substrate at 600 mm intervals for overhangs 150--300 mm |
| **Engineered stone (40 mm)** | Depends on overhang | 26 mm substrate for mitred edges | Heavier; ensure cabinet carcass can support weight |
| **Natural stone (granite, marble)** | Yes (for overhangs >150 mm) | 18 mm MDF | Same as engineered stone; natural stone is heavier per m2 |
| **Laminate** | Built-in | HMR particleboard or MDF is the benchtop substrate itself | Laminate is bonded to the substrate; they are one unit |
| **Timber** | Generally self-supporting | May need additional bearers for long spans | Timber benchtop is its own structural element; fix to cabinets with slotted screw holes |
| **Concrete** | Not applicable (self-supporting) | Steel or timber frame may be needed | Very heavy: ~95 kg/m2 at 40 mm thickness (wet-cast); GFRC ~45 kg/m2; structural assessment of cabinets and floor may be needed |
| **Dekton / porcelain (12 mm)** | Yes -- full substrate | Full 18 mm substrate; 26 mm for 40 mm mitred edges | Most restrictive: no drainage grooves; undermount sinks must be rebated or same-sized |
| **Dekton / porcelain (20 mm)** | No substrate required | Back-to-front supports every 600 mm and around cutouts >600 mm | Standard overhang max 300 mm; MDF substrate required beyond 300 mm |
| **Dekton / porcelain (5--8 mm)** | Not suitable for benchtops | -- | Splashback use only |

### Concrete Benchtop -- Special Structural Note

| Property | Wet-Cast Concrete | GFRC (Glass Fibre Reinforced) |
|---|---|---|
| Weight at 40 mm thickness | ~95 kg per m2 | ~45 kg per m2 |
| Typical thickness | 40--50 mm | 20--30 mm |
| Reinforcement | Steel rebar or wire mesh required | Glass fibre reinforcement built in |
| Cabinet requirements | May require steel-framed cabinets or additional structural support; standard particleboard carcasses may not be sufficient | Standard cabinets usually sufficient; confirm with fabricator |
| Floor assessment | Verify floor can support concentrated load at cabinet feet | Less critical but still verify for large island benches |

---

## 6. Coordination Notes -- Cabinet Maker and Stone Mason Communication

### 6.1 Required Communication Points

| Topic | Detail | Who Confirms |
|---|---|---|
| Exact overhang dimensions | Front overhang (typically 20--40 mm past cabinet face); side overhangs; breakfast bar overhang | Cabinet maker confirms cabinet positions; stone mason confirms feasibility |
| Waterfall end details | Cabinet end panel must be plumb; flooring under waterfall must be confirmed (stone mason measures to subfloor and deducts flooring thickness + underlay); 1 mm packers used during glue cure | Stone mason measures; cabinet maker and flooring contractor confirm floor build-up |
| Undermount sink support | Support rails around entire cut-out perimeter; sink recessed into substrate with 5 mm clearance all sides; actual sink must be on site for template | Cabinet maker installs substrate and rails; stone mason templates to sink |
| Splashback interface | Upstand (60--150 mm stone strip) is templated and installed by stone mason at same time as benchtop; full-height tiled splashback requires benchtop installed first, then tiler works to top of stone edge | Stone mason for upstand; tiler for full-height; cabinet maker ensures wall is flat behind run |
| Appliance dimensions | All appliance models and dimensions must be finalised BEFORE cabinet manufacture begins; cooktop cut-out is built into cabinetry and substrate | Client / designer confirms models; cabinet maker builds to spec; stone mason templates to spec |

### 6.2 Critical Sequencing -- What Must Happen Before What

| Step | Must Be Complete Before |
|---|---|
| Appliance selection (sink, cooktop, tap) confirmed | Cabinet manufacture |
| Cabinet manufacture | Cabinet installation |
| Plumbing and electrical rough-in | Cabinet installation |
| Cabinet installation and levelling | Stone template |
| Substrate and support rail installation | Stone template |
| Stone template | Stone fabrication |
| Stone fabrication | Stone installation |
| Stone installation | Tiled splashback installation (if full-height tiles) |
| Stone installation | Final plumbing connections (sink, tap, dishwasher) |
| Stone installation | Final electrical connections (cooktop) |

### 6.3 Appliance Lock-In Rule

**Appliance dimensions must be finalised BEFORE cabinet manufacture.**

This is non-negotiable. If the client changes their cooktop model after cabinets are built, the cut-out may be wrong. If the client changes their sink model after stone is templated, a new template is required (at additional cost, typically $200--$400 for a re-template).

### 6.4 Sink Lock-In Rule

**Sink model must be confirmed BEFORE stone template.**

The actual sink (or exact manufacturer specification sheet with dimensions) must be available at template. Many fabricators require the physical sink to be on site so they can trace the exact undermount profile.

---

## 7. Practical Coordination Timeline -- Typical Kitchen Renovation

| Week | Activity | Responsible Trade |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1--2 | Client finalises appliance selections (sink, cooktop, tap, rangehood) | Client / designer |
| Week 2--4 | Cabinet design finalised; stone colour selected | Cabinet maker / designer |
| Week 4--8 | Cabinet manufacture | Cabinet maker |
| Week 8--9 | Cabinet delivery and installation; levelling; substrate installation; support rails | Cabinet maker |
| Week 9 | Stone template (book minimum 2 weeks in advance) | Stone fabricator |
| Week 9--11 | Stone fabrication (5--15 business days depending on material and complexity) | Stone fabricator |
| Week 11 | Stone benchtop installation | Stone fabricator |
| Week 11--12 | Splashback tiling (if full-height tiles) | Tiler |
| Week 12 | Final plumbing and electrical connections | Plumber / electrician |

**Note:** This is a simplified, ideal timeline. Delays in appliance delivery or cabinet manufacture will push out all subsequent dates. The stone template cannot happen until cabinets are installed and level.

---

## 8. Common Pitfalls and Failures

### 8.1 Pitfalls Table

| Pitfall | Consequence | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Cabinets not level (beyond 2 mm tolerance) | Stone fabricator refuses to template; delays project | Cabinet maker to level-check entire run with 1200 mm spirit level before booking template |
| Appliance model changed after cabinet manufacture | Cut-outs wrong size; cabinets may need to be remade | Lock in all appliance models and get written confirmation before manufacturing starts |
| Sink model changed after stone template | New template required; re-fabrication cost; 1--2 week delay | Lock in sink model and have physical sink on site for template |
| Substrate not installed before template | Stone fabricator cannot template; wasted site visit (may incur call-out fee) | Cabinet maker to complete full substrate installation including support rails before booking template |
| Splashback tiles installed before stone template | Template cannot account for actual stone thickness at wall interface; gap or overlap likely | Always template and install stone BEFORE tiling the splashback |
| Overhang brackets not installed | Stone overhangs beyond 300 mm will flex, crack, or fail over time | Cabinet maker or builder to install steel brackets at max 600 mm centres for any overhang exceeding 300 mm |
| Island bench not fixed to floor | Island moves during template or installation; stone does not fit; safety risk | All island cabinets must be permanently fixed to floor before template |
| Undermount sink attempted with laminate benchtop | Moisture ingress; particleboard swelling; benchtop failure within 1--3 years | Recommend stone or solid-surface for undermount sinks; if laminate is required, use top-mount sink |
| Timber benchtop cut-outs not sealed | Moisture enters through end grain; swelling, cupping, mould | Seal all cut-out surfaces with minimum 4 coats; envelope-seal entire benchtop |
| Waterfall end flooring not coordinated | Stone panel too long or too short at floor level; visible gap | Stone mason, cabinet maker, and flooring contractor must communicate exact floor build-up before template |
| Seam/join placement not discussed with client | Client unhappy with visible join location on a long benchtop | Stone fabricator should present MDF template with marked seam positions for client approval before cutting stone |
| No access planning for stone delivery | Stone panels (80--120 kg) cannot fit through doorways or up stairs | Confirm access path dimensions before fabrication; consider panel sizes |
