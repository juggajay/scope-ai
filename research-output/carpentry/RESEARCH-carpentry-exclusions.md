# Carpentry & Joinery Scope Research - Common Exclusions
## Australian Residential Renovations

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Reference document for AI scope-of-works generator (ScopeAI) - Section 7: Common Exclusions
**Coverage:** Kitchen cabinetry, joinery, wardrobes, and general carpentry exclusions in residential renovation scopes
**Confidence:** HIGH - Based on Australian trade publications, consumer protection bodies, renovation specialists, supplier guides, and industry standard practice.

> **Why this matters:** The majority of budget blowouts and disputes between Australian homeowners and tradespeople stem from assumptions about what is and is not included in a scope of works. Exclusions are the single most important section of any carpentry/joinery scope because homeowners routinely assume items are included when they are not. A well-documented exclusions section prevents Fair Trading complaints, NCAT/VCAT claims, and relationship breakdowns between client and tradesperson.

## SECTION 7: COMMON EXCLUSIONS FROM CARPENTRY & JOINERY SCOPES

### 7.1 Benchtop Supply and Install (Stone / Solid Surface)

#### Why Benchtops Are Excluded from the Cabinet Maker's Scope

Stone, porcelain, and solid-surface benchtops are manufactured and installed by a separate specialist trade (stone mason / stone fabricator). This is a distinct trade for several reasons:

- **Specialist equipment**: Stone fabrication requires CNC machinery, diamond-blade cutting, and polishing equipment that cabinet makers do not operate.
- **Separate measurement**: The stone fabricator conducts their own site measure (template) AFTER cabinets are installed and level. This is critical because even 2-3mm variance affects the final fit.
- **Engineered stone ban**: Since 1 July 2024, engineered stone (containing crystalline silica) has been prohibited Australia-wide under WHS Regulations. This has shifted the market to natural stone, porcelain/sintered stone, and solid surface materials, all of which require specialist fabrication.
- **Warranty separation**: The stone fabricator warranties the benchtop independently of the cabinetry.

#### What IS Included in the Cabinet Maker's Scope (Re: Benchtops)

| Cabinet Maker's Responsibility | Stone Mason's Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Build base cabinets level and plumb | Template (site measure) after cabinet install |
| Provide adequate support rails/framework for stone weight | Fabricate benchtop to template |
| Cut sink and cooktop openings in cabinet top (if applicable) | Cut sink, cooktop, and tap hole openings in stone |
| Coordinate timing with stone mason | Transport and install benchtop |
| Ensure cabinets can support stone weight (40-60 kg/m2 for 20mm stone) | Seal joins, polish edges, apply sealant |
| Install any required support brackets for overhangs >300mm | Provide warranty on benchtop material and installation |

#### Benchtop Cost Context (for PC Sum Reference)

| Material | Installed Cost Per m2 (2025-2026) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Laminate benchtop | $200-$600/m2 | Often included in cabinet maker's scope |
| Solid surface (e.g. Corian) | $600-$1,200/m2 | Separate trade |
| Porcelain / sintered stone (e.g. Dekton, Neolith) | $900-$2,000+/m2 | Post-ban alternative to engineered stone |
| Natural stone (granite, marble) | $1,200-$3,000+/m2 | Separate trade, significant weight |
| Timber benchtop | $400-$1,000/m2 | Sometimes included in cabinet maker's scope |

**Key dispute point:** Homeowners frequently assume the kitchen quote includes benchtops because the cabinet maker discussed benchtop selection during design. The design discussion is part of coordination, not supply.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 7.2 Appliance Supply

#### The Rule: Cabinet Maker Builds to Accommodate, Does NOT Supply

The cabinet maker designs and builds cabinetry with precise openings and provisions for appliances, but the homeowner (or builder) is responsible for purchasing and supplying all appliances. This is universal practice in Australia.

#### Appliances the Homeowner Must Purchase

| Appliance | Standard Opening Width | Critical Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wall oven | 600mm (standard), 700mm, 900mm | Must confirm exact model BEFORE cabinet manufacture |
| Cooktop (gas or induction) | 600mm or 900mm | Minimum clearances to combustible surfaces per AS/NZS 5601.1 for gas |
| Rangehood | Match cooktop width (600mm or 900mm) | Ducting route must be planned; canopy vs integrated affects cabinetry |
| Dishwasher | 600mm standard base cabinet width | Check height - some models need panel-ready or custom door |
| Fridge | Varies significantly by brand/model | Ventilation clearances (top, sides, back) per manufacturer warranty requirements |
| Microwave (if built-in) | Typically 600mm wide niche | Requires dedicated GPO in cabinet |
| Integrated bin system | 300mm, 450mm, or 600mm pull-out | Confirm model before manufacture |

#### Why Appliance Dimensions MUST Be Confirmed Before Cabinet Manufacture

- Cabinet openings are manufactured to exact millimetre tolerances.
- Different brands have different dimensions even at the same "standard" size (e.g., a Fisher & Paykel 600mm oven may differ by 5-10mm from a Bosch 600mm oven).
- Fridge cavity dimensions are especially critical - each model has its own ventilation space requirements for top, back, and sides. Failure to comply with manufacturer ventilation requirements may void the appliance warranty.
- If the homeowner changes their appliance selection after cabinets are manufactured, the cabinet maker will charge a variation to modify or remake affected cabinets.

**Key dispute point:** Homeowner assumes "the kitchen" includes appliances. Quotes that say "kitchen supply and install" without explicitly listing exclusions are the primary cause of this misunderstanding. The appliance budget for a standard kitchen is $5,000-$15,000+ on top of the cabinetry cost.

### 7.3 Handles and Hardware - Typically a Provisional Cost (PC) Sum

#### Why Handles Are Excluded or Listed as a PC Sum

Handles are one of the most personal design choices in a kitchen or joinery project. Homeowners typically want to select handles that match their overall design aesthetic, which may not be finalised when the cabinet maker provides their quote.

#### How It Works in Practice

| Approach | Description | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| **PC Sum (most common)** | Cabinet maker includes a dollar allowance for handles in the quote. Homeowner selects handles. If selection costs more than allowance, homeowner pays the difference. If less, they receive a credit. | Most kitchen and joinery quotes |
| **Excluded entirely** | Handles are not in the quote at all. Homeowner sources and supplies handles. Cabinet maker installs them (installation labour usually included). | Some quotes, particularly from smaller operators |
| **Included (specified)** | Specific handle model is named and priced in the quote. Less common unless the design is fully resolved before quoting. | Design-and-build firms, fully specified projects |

#### Typical PC Sum Ranges for Handles (2025-2026)

| Kitchen Size | Number of Handles | Budget Range | Mid-Range | Premium Range |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small galley (8-12 handles) | 8-12 | $70-$120 | $120-$350 | $350-$600+ |
| Standard L-shape (15-20 handles) | 15-20 | $130-$200 | $200-$600 | $600-$1,000+ |
| Large U-shape / island (20-30 handles) | 20-30 | $200-$300 | $300-$900 | $900-$1,500+ |

Individual handle prices range from approximately $3 (basic Bunnings) to $50+ (designer brass, leather, or custom). A common PC sum allowance for a mid-range kitchen is $300-$500.

**What IS included by the cabinet maker:**
- Drilling/routing for handle holes (once handle selection is confirmed)
- Installation of handles
- Advice on handle placement and spacing

**What is NOT included:**
- The handles themselves (unless specified or PC sum covers it)
- Multiple rounds of re-drilling if homeowner changes handle selection after installation

**Key dispute point:** Homeowner selects $45/handle designer hardware after the quote allowed $8/handle. On a 25-handle kitchen, this is a $925 overspend that the homeowner did not anticipate.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 7.4 Splashback - Separate Trade (Tiling or Glass)

#### Why Splashbacks Are NOT Part of the Cabinet Maker's Scope

Splashbacks are installed by a tiler (for tile splashbacks) or a glass specialist (for glass splashbacks). This is a separate trade because:

- **Different skillset**: Tiling and glass installation require specialist tools, adhesives, and knowledge of relevant standards.
- **Safety compliance**: Glass splashbacks behind cooktops must comply with AS/NZS 2208 (safety glazing) and only toughened safety glass may be used. Gas cooktop clearances are governed by AS/NZS 5601.1.
- **Sequencing**: Splashbacks are installed AFTER cabinetry is in place and AFTER benchtops are installed, but BEFORE final electrical fit-off (for GPO cover plates).
- **Material selection**: Splashback material (subway tiles, large-format tiles, glass, pressed metal, stone) is a design decision that sits outside the cabinet maker's trade.

#### The Exception: Laminate Splashback Strip

Some cabinet makers will supply and install a small laminate splashback strip (typically 50-100mm high) between the benchtop and the tiled or glass splashback zone. This is sometimes called a "return" or "upstand" and is a continuation of the benchtop material (particularly with laminate benchtops). This is the ONLY splashback element that may be included in the cabinet maker's scope.

#### Splashback Responsibility Summary

| Element | Responsible Trade |
|---|---|
| Tile splashback (supply and install) | Tiler |
| Glass splashback (supply and install) | Glass specialist / glazier |
| Pressed metal or stone splashback | Respective specialist trade |
| Laminate upstand/return (50-100mm) | Cabinet maker (sometimes included) |
| Preparation of wall surface behind cabinets | Plasterer / painter (before cabinet install) |

**Key dispute point:** Homeowner sees a kitchen render showing a beautiful tiled splashback and assumes it is part of the kitchen quote. Splashback tiling for a standard kitchen costs $800-$3,000+ depending on tile selection and area.

**Confidence:** HIGH

### 7.5 Painting - Separate Trade (With Important Distinctions)

#### The Key Distinction: Factory-Finished Doors vs Site-Painted Cabinetry

| Finish Type | Who Does It | Where It Happens | Included in Cabinet Maker's Scope? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2-pac spray finish (polyurethane)** | Specialist spray painter or cabinet maker's subcontractor | Off-site workshop / spray booth | YES - typically included in cabinet maker's quote as a line item |
| **Vinyl wrap / thermolaminated** | Applied during manufacture | Factory | YES - included in cabinet price |
| **Laminate (HPL)** | Applied during manufacture | Factory | YES - included in cabinet price |
| **Natural timber (clear coat)** | Cabinet maker or specialist finisher | Workshop | YES - typically included |
| **Site painting of walls around/behind cabinets** | Painter | On-site | NO - painter's scope |
| **Touch-up painting after cabinet installation** | Painter | On-site | NO - painter's scope |
| **Painting of existing cabinetry (respray)** | Specialist 2-pac spray painter | Off-site or on-site | Separate quote entirely |

#### What This Means in Practice

- The cabinet maker's quote includes the finish on the cabinet doors and carcasses (whether that is laminate, vinyl wrap, 2-pac, or timber).
- The cabinet maker does NOT paint the surrounding walls, ceiling, or any other surfaces.
- After cabinet installation, the painter comes through to paint around the cabinetry, touch up any damage from the install process, and finish any exposed wall surfaces.
- 2-pac spray finishing is a specialist sub-trade. Many cabinet makers subcontract this to dedicated 2-pac spray shops (e.g., PLC2PAC, Pro2Pac, Kitchen Coatings). The cost is built into the cabinet maker's quote, but the work happens off-site in a controlled spray booth environment.

**Key dispute point:** Homeowner assumes "painting" is one trade that covers everything. In reality, the cabinet door finish is part of the joinery scope (factory-applied), while wall painting around cabinets is the painter's scope. If the scope document just says "painting - excluded," the homeowner may think their cabinet doors will arrive unfinished.

### 7.6 Demolition of Existing Cabinetry

#### Who Is Responsible?

Demolition of existing kitchen or joinery is a grey area that MUST be explicitly addressed in the scope. There is no default industry standard - it varies by tradesperson and project.

| Scenario | Typical Responsibility | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Builder-managed renovation | Demolition contractor or builder's labourer | Included in builder's scope, not cabinet maker's |
| Direct-to-cabinet-maker engagement | Could go either way | MUST be stated in the scope |
| Cabinet maker includes demo | Cabinet maker removes old cabinets | Usually as a separate line item with a cost |
| Cabinet maker excludes demo | Homeowner arranges removal before cabinet maker arrives | Cabinet maker expects a clear, empty space on install day |

#### Critical Sub-Items Within Demolition

| Item | Typically Included in Demo? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Removal of old cabinets from walls/floor | Yes (if demo is in scope) | Careful removal to minimise wall/floor damage |
| Removal of old benchtops | Yes (if demo is in scope) | Stone benchtops require 2+ people due to weight |
| Removal of old splashback tiles | Often NO - separate to cabinet demo | Tiler or demolition contractor |
| Disposal / skip bin | Usually EXCLUDED even if demo is included | Skip bin hire is $300-$800+ depending on size and location |
| Disconnection of plumbing (sink, dishwasher) | NO - must be done by licensed plumber | Cabinet maker cannot disconnect plumbing |
| Disconnection of electrical (oven, cooktop, rangehood) | NO - must be done by licensed electrician | Cabinet maker cannot disconnect electrical |
| Asbestos-containing materials | NO - must be done by licensed asbestos removalist | See Section 7.9 |
| Making good walls/floors after removal | Often NO - plasterer's or carpenter's scope | Patching plasterboard, filling holes, etc. |

**Key dispute point:** Cabinet maker quote says "removal of existing kitchen" but the homeowner assumes this includes the skip bin, plumber disconnection, electrician disconnection, splashback removal, and wall patching. Each of these is a separate cost. A "full kitchen strip-out" including all trades can cost $2,000-$5,000+ before the new kitchen even begins.

### 7.7 Plumbing and Electrical - Must Be by Licensed Trades

#### The Law

In every Australian state and territory, plumbing and electrical work MUST be carried out by licensed tradespeople. A cabinet maker, regardless of how experienced, cannot legally perform any plumbing or electrical work. This is not optional - it is a legal requirement under relevant state/territory licensing legislation.

#### Plumbing Scope (NOT the Cabinet Maker's Work)

| Task | Trade Required | When It Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Disconnection of existing sink, taps, dishwasher | Licensed plumber | Before demolition |
| Rough-in of water supply pipes to new sink location | Licensed plumber | During rough-in stage (before cabinets) |
| Rough-in of waste pipes to new sink/dishwasher location | Licensed plumber | During rough-in stage |
| Connection of new sink and taps | Licensed plumber | After cabinets and benchtop installed |
| Connection of dishwasher (water supply and waste) | Licensed plumber | After cabinets installed |
| Gas connection for cooktop (if gas) | Licensed gasfitter (or plumber with gas endorsement) | After cabinets and benchtop installed |
| Connection of under-sink water filter | Licensed plumber | After cabinets and benchtop installed |

#### Electrical Scope (NOT the Cabinet Maker's Work)

| Task | Trade Required | When It Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Disconnection of existing oven, cooktop, rangehood | Licensed electrician | Before demolition |
| Rough-in of power circuits to new appliance locations | Licensed electrician | During rough-in stage (before cabinets) |
| Installation of GPOs (powerpoints) behind/inside cabinets | Licensed electrician | Rough-in before cabinets, fit-off after |
| Hardwired connection of oven (if hardwired model) | Licensed electrician | After cabinets installed |
| Connection of rangehood to power | Licensed electrician | After cabinets installed |
| Under-cabinet LED lighting wiring | Licensed electrician | Rough-in before, fit-off after cabinets |
| In-cabinet lighting (inside pantry, drawers) | Licensed electrician (for wiring); cabinet maker may install low-voltage LED strips | Coordination required |
| Switchboard upgrade (if required for new circuits) | Licensed electrician | Early in project |

#### What the Cabinet Maker DOES Do (Coordination)

- Provides a cabinetry plan showing exact locations for plumbing and electrical rough-in points
- Specifies required GPO locations (e.g., "GPO required inside pantry at 1200mm AFL, left side")
- Cuts holes in cabinet backs/bases for pipe and cable access
- Installs any low-voltage LED strip lighting that plugs into a GPO (no hardwiring)
- Coordinates timing with plumber and electrician for the fit-off stage

**Key dispute point:** Homeowner receives a kitchen quote for $25,000 and assumes the sink will be connected, the oven will be wired in, and the rangehood will work when the cabinet maker leaves. None of this is the cabinet maker's work. Plumbing and electrical fit-off for a kitchen renovation typically adds $1,500-$4,000 depending on complexity and layout changes.

**Compliance certificates:** Both the plumber and electrician must provide compliance certificates upon completion. These are required for insurance and resale purposes. The cabinet maker does not issue any compliance certificates for plumbing or electrical work (because they do not perform it).

### 7.8 Floor Levelling and Preparation

#### The Assumption: Cabinet Maker Assumes the Floor Is Level

Cabinet makers arrive on installation day expecting a reasonably level floor. "Reasonably level" in practice means within approximately 3-5mm over the length of the cabinet run. If the floor is out by more than this, problems arise:

| Floor Condition | Cabinet Maker's Response | Additional Cost? |
|---|---|---|
| Level within 3-5mm | Shim as part of standard install | No - included in install price |
| Out by 5-15mm | Can shim but may need toe-kick/plinth adjustments | Minor additional charge possible |
| Out by 15mm+ | Cannot proceed without floor levelling | Separate trade required (floor leveller / tiler) |
| Significant slope or undulation | Major levelling compound or structural work needed | Separate trade, $500-$3,000+ depending on area |

#### What IS Included in Cabinet Maker's Scope

- Minor shimming of cabinets to achieve level installation
- Scribing plinths (toe-kicks) to uneven floors where variance is minor
- Scribing end panels or fillers to uneven walls
- Levelling cabinets to each other using standard techniques

#### What is NOT Included

- Self-levelling compound application
- Floor grinding or preparation
- Structural floor repairs (sagging joists, rotten bearers)
- Removal of existing floor coverings
- Installation of new floor covering before or after cabinets

#### The Floor-First vs Cabinets-First Debate

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Floor first, then cabinets on top** | Seamless floor appearance; easier future kitchen replacement | Wasted flooring under cabinets; potential damage to new floor during install |
| **Cabinets first, then floor up to cabinets** | No wasted flooring; no risk of floor damage during install | Difficult to replace cabinets later without disturbing floor; visible join at plinth line |

This must be decided and documented in the scope. It affects the cabinet plinth height and the sequencing of trades.

**Key dispute point:** Cabinet maker arrives and the floor is 20mm out of level across the kitchen run. They cannot install. The homeowner now needs a floor leveller, which adds $1,000-$3,000 and delays the project by a week. This should have been identified at the pre-start check measure.

### 7.9 Additional Common Exclusions

The following items are routinely excluded from carpentry/joinery scopes. Every one of them has caused disputes when not explicitly stated.

#### Regulatory and Professional Fees

| Exclusion | Why It's Excluded | Typical Cost Range | Who Is Responsible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Council/building permits (CDC or DA) | Regulatory approval, not a trade task | $200-$5,000+ depending on scope | Homeowner or builder |
| Structural engineering fees | Required if removing walls, adding beams, modifying structure | $500-$3,000+ | Homeowner or builder |
| Building certifier / private certifier fees | Required for inspections and final sign-off | $1,000-$3,000+ | Homeowner or builder |
| Design fees (if separate from cabinet maker) | Kitchen designer may be engaged independently | $500-$5,000+ | Homeowner |

#### Hazardous Materials

| Exclusion | Why It's Excluded | Typical Cost Range | Who Is Responsible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asbestos testing | Required for any home built or renovated before 1990; must presume asbestos until proven otherwise | $50-$200 per sample | Homeowner |
| Asbestos removal | Must be performed by licensed asbestos removalist; cabinet maker cannot and must not disturb ACMs | $1,500-$10,000+ depending on extent | Licensed asbestos removalist |
| Lead paint testing and removal | Pre-1970s homes may have lead-based paint on surfaces behind cabinets | $200-$2,000+ | Specialist or painter |

**Important note on asbestos:** For pre-1990 Australian homes, the bottom half of kitchen walls frequently contains asbestos-containing fibreboard. This is often hidden behind existing cabinets and only discovered during demolition. The cabinet maker's scope should explicitly state: "Exclusion: Asbestos testing, identification, and removal. If asbestos-containing materials are encountered, work will stop immediately and the homeowner must engage a licensed asbestos removalist before work can continue."

#### Access and Site Conditions

| Exclusion | Why It's Excluded | Typical Cost Range | Who Is Responsible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scaffolding / access equipment | Rarely needed for interior joinery, but may be required for high ceilings, stairwell joinery, or external work | $500-$3,000+ per week | Builder or homeowner |
| Temporary protection of existing finishes | Protecting floors, benchtops, or other surfaces during install | Usually included as good practice, but not always | Cabinet maker (should be included) |
| Site access (e.g., narrow hallways, stairs to upper floors) | Additional labour if cabinets must be carried up flights of stairs or through tight access | $200-$800+ surcharge | Cabinet maker (should be quoted if known) |
| After-hours or weekend work | If installation cannot happen during standard business hours | 50-100% surcharge on labour | Homeowner |

#### Items Frequently Assumed to Be Included But Are NOT

| Exclusion | Reality | Typical Cost | Common Assumption |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sink and tap supply** | Sometimes PC sum, sometimes excluded entirely. Cabinet maker does NOT supply plumbing fixtures. | $200-$2,000+ (sink + tap) | "The kitchen includes a sink" |
| **Window furnishings** (blinds, curtains) | Completely separate trade (blind supplier/installer) | $200-$1,500 per window | Often forgotten in kitchen reno budgets |
| **Site clean-up** (beyond own waste) | Cabinet maker removes their own packaging and offcuts, NOT general site rubbish | $300-$800 for professional clean | "They'll clean up when they're done" |
| **Temporary kitchen setup** | No provision for a temporary cooking/washing area during renovation | $0-$500 (DIY setup) | Not considered until the kitchen is ripped out |
| **Data / AV cabling** | Requires licensed cabler (ACMA registered); not a cabinet maker task | $100-$500 per point | "Can you run a network cable through the pantry?" |
| **Skip bin hire** | For demolition waste, even if demo is included in scope | $300-$800+ depending on size/location | "Demo is included so disposal must be too" |
| **Floor covering under cabinets** | Depends on floor-first vs cabinets-first approach (see Section 7.8) | N/A (affects flooring quote) | Not discussed until it's too late |
| **Waterproofing** (behind sink, wet areas) | Licensed waterproofer's scope where required | $500-$2,000+ | Assumed to be part of kitchen install |

### 7.10 How to Document Exclusions in a Scope of Works

#### Principles for ScopeAI to Follow

Every scope of works generated by ScopeAI MUST include a dedicated "Exclusions" section. This section should follow these principles:

1. **Explicit, not implied**: Never assume the reader knows what is excluded. State it clearly.
2. **Name the responsible trade**: Where another trade is responsible, name them (e.g., "Plumbing connections - by licensed plumber, not included in this scope").
3. **Note homeowner-supply items**: Where the homeowner must purchase or supply something, state it clearly with timing requirements (e.g., "Appliances to be supplied by owner. Appliance dimensions must be confirmed and provided to cabinet maker minimum 4 weeks before manufacture commences.").
4. **State PC sum allowances with ranges**: Where a PC sum is included, state the allowance AND note the consequence of exceeding it (e.g., "Handle allowance: $400 PC sum. Any amount over this allowance will be invoiced as a variation.").
5. **Use plain language**: Avoid trade jargon where possible. Write for a homeowner who has never renovated before.

#### The "No Surprises" Test

Before finalising any scope, ScopeAI should apply this test: **"Would a homeowner who has never renovated before understand exactly what they are getting, and exactly what they are NOT getting, from reading this scope?"**

If the answer is no, the exclusions section needs more detail.

**Confidence:** HIGH
