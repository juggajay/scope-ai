# Kitchen Cabinetry -- Australian Specifications for Scope of Works Generation

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Provide exhaustive kitchen cabinetry specifications for the ScopeAI system prompt. This document covers dimensions, materials, hardware, fittings, and quality tiers specific to the Australian residential renovation market.
**Confidence Note:** Dimensions, material specifications, and hardware model numbers are sourced from Australian manufacturer data, industry standards (AS/NZS 4386), and leading Australian suppliers (Blum AU, Hafele AU, Polytec, Laminex). Where Australian-specific data was unavailable, best-practice industry norms have been applied and are noted. All figures should be validated against current manufacturer catalogues at time of use.

## A. Base Cabinets

### A1. Standard Dimensions

| Dimension | Standard Value | Range / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Overall height (to benchtop)** | 900mm from FFL | 850--1050mm (adjustable for user ergonomics) |
| **Carcass height** | 720mm | Fixed in most systems; some suppliers offer 770mm |
| **Kickboard height** | 150mm | 100--200mm range; 150mm is the Australian norm |
| **Kickboard setback** | 50mm from cabinet face | 50--70mm to door/drawer face |
| **Benchtop thickness** | 20--40mm | 20mm laminate, 20--40mm stone, 40mm timber |
| **Carcass depth** | 560--600mm | 580mm is most common; benchtop overhangs carcass by 20--40mm |
| **Standard widths** | 300, 450, 600, 750, 900mm | 1000mm and 1200mm available for corner units |
| **Corner base cabinet** | 900 x 900mm (L-shaped) | Also 1000 x 1000mm; requires lazy susan or corner carousel |

### A2. Carcass Materials

| Material | Thickness | Moisture Rating | Use Case | Cost Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **HMR Particleboard (melamine-faced)** | 16mm | HMR (Highly Moisture Resistant) | Standard carcass material for 90%+ of Australian kitchens | Budget to Mid-range |
| **MR MDF (Moisture Resistant MDF)** | 16mm | MR | Used where routing/profiling of carcass panels is needed; smoother surface | Mid-range |
| **Plywood (hardwood or birch)** | 16--18mm | Excellent natural moisture resistance | Premium kitchens; superior screw-holding, structural rigidity, longevity | Premium to Luxury |
| **Marine Plywood** | 18mm | Waterproof | Rarely used in standard kitchens; sometimes for sink cabinets in ultra-premium builds | Luxury |

**Notes for scope writers:**
- The Australian industry standard carcass is **16mm White HMR Particleboard** with matching 1mm ABS edging. Brands: Laminex, STONEply/CUSTOMpine (available at Bunnings and trade suppliers).
- HMR particleboard is rated to resist swelling in humid conditions but is NOT waterproof -- sustained water contact will cause damage.
- Plywood carcass is a meaningful upgrade that should be called out as a line item when specified.
- All carcass backs are typically **3mm HDF or 6mm HMR** depending on quality level.

## D. Island Bench

### D1. Construction Methods

| Method | Description | When Used | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cabinet-based** | Standard base cabinets (as per Section A) arranged back-to-back or side-by-side; secured together and to floor | Most common; standard kitchens | Standard |
| **Frame-based** | Steel or timber frame with cabinet fronts/panels attached; often used for large islands with stone waterfall ends | Large islands; heavy stone benchtops; structural requirements | Premium |
| **Hybrid** | Cabinets on one side, open frame on seating side | Islands with breakfast bar overhang on one side | Mid-range to Premium |

### D2. Waterfall Benchtop Provision

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| **What the cabinetmaker does** | Constructs the island carcass to the exact dimensions required for the stone fabricator; leaves the waterfall end open (no end panel) so stone wraps from benchtop down the side to floor level |
| **End panel omission** | Waterfall side has NO cabinet end panel -- the stone IS the end panel |
| **Support** | Internal timber or steel cleats/brackets to support the vertical stone panel; stone fabricator often specifies requirements |
| **Alignment** | Cabinet carcass must be perfectly plumb and square; any deviation shows in the stone mitre joint |
| **Kickboard** | Waterfall stone typically extends to floor; no kickboard on waterfall end |
| **Coordination** | Cabinet maker must coordinate with stone fabricator on exact dimensions, support requirements, and installation sequence |
| **Scope note** | "Island carcass to allow for waterfall benchtop on [left/right/both] end(s). No end panel on waterfall side(s). Provide internal support cleats as specified by stone fabricator. Coordinate dimensions with benchtop supplier prior to manufacture." |

### D3. Breakfast Bar Overhang

| Specification | Standard Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Typical overhang depth** | 300--450mm | 300mm minimum for comfortable knee clearance |
| **Support requirement** | Overhangs exceeding 300mm require support brackets or structural reinforcement | Stone fabricators and NCC requirements |
| **Bracket types** | Concealed steel L-brackets; flat bar supports; corbels (decorative) | Hidden brackets preferred for modern kitchens |
| **Bracket spacing** | 450--600mm apart | Closer spacing for heavier stones |
| **Bracket capacity** | 150--325kg per bracket depending on model | Verify with bracket manufacturer |
| **Seating depth** | 250--300mm per seat position | Minimum 600mm width per seat |
| **Bar height** | 900mm (bench height seating) or 1050mm (bar height seating) | Bench height matches benchtop; bar height requires raised section |

### D4. Services Access

| Service | Coordination Requirement | Scope Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Plumbing (sink in island)** | Floor penetration for hot/cold water supply and waste; cabinet base panel must accommodate pipes; coordinate with plumber BEFORE cabinet manufacture | "Allow floor penetrations for plumbing services. Base panel cut-outs per plumber's mark-up." |
| **Electrical (power points in island)** | Floor or under-bench conduit for power; GPOs typically mounted in island end panel or pop-up unit in benchtop | "Allow cable pathway through island carcass for [number] x GPO locations per electrical plan." |
| **Gas (cooktop in island)** | Gas line through floor; coordination with gasfitter; ventilation requirements | "Allow gas line penetration through island base. Coordinate with gasfitter." |

### D5. Back Panel Finishing

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Visible sides** | Any side of the island visible from living/dining areas must be finished with a matching panel |
| **Panel material** | Same as door finish OR a feature panel (e.g., V-groove, timber panelling, stone) |
| **Typical approach** | Back panel (opposite the working side) finished in matching laminate/2-pac; may include open shelving, wine rack, or display niches |
