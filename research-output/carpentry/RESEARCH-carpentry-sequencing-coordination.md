## 1. When Does the Cabinet Maker Need Final Measurements?

Final measurements (also called "site measure" or "check measure") are the precision measurements the cabinet maker takes on-site before committing the order to manufacture. Getting the timing wrong causes costly rework, delays, or cabinets that do not fit.

### Prerequisites Before Final Measurement

| Prerequisite | Why It Must Be Complete | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Demolition of existing kitchen/bathroom | Old cabinetry, tiles, and fittings must be removed so the cabinet maker can measure the actual wall surfaces, not the old fitout. | Includes removal of old splashback tiles if they sit proud of the wall. |
| Structural work (wall removal, beam installation) | Any changes to the room's footprint must be finished. A wall that is yet to come down or a beam not yet installed will change room dimensions. | Steel beams often require boxing-in with plasterboard — this must also be complete. |
| Plastering / gyprocking complete | Walls must be at their finished surface. Plasterboard adds 10-13mm per layer per side. Measuring at framing stage without accounting for plasterboard thickness is a documented cause of fitting errors in Australian renovations. | Walls should be plastered, set (joints taped and sanded), and ideally primed. Cornices should be installed. |
| Floor levelling complete | If floor-standing cabinets, the finished floor level must be established. Cabinets are shimmed to level, but the cabinet maker needs to know the floor plane to determine kickboard heights and overall cabinet heights. | See Section 3 for the "tiles under cabinets" decision. |
| Plumbing and electrical rough-in complete | Pipe and cable positions in the walls/floor must be finalised so they align with the cabinet design. The cabinet maker will note positions of waste pipes, water points, and GPO locations during the site measure. | The rough-in positions are based on the preliminary cabinet plan — the site measure confirms everything matches. |

### Floor Levelling — Before or After Cabinets?

This depends on the approach chosen for floor tiling:

| Approach | Floor Levelling Timing | Cabinet Maker Measurement Timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Tiles run under cabinets** | Floor must be levelled and tiled BEFORE cabinet installation. Cabinet maker measures after tiling is complete. | After floor tiling. |
| **Tiles butt up to cabinets** | Floor must be levelled (screed/self-leveller) but NOT tiled before cabinets go in. Cabinet maker measures after levelling compound is down. | After floor levelling, before floor tiling. |

**Australian common practice:** In most mid-range residential renovations, cabinets are installed on the levelled subfloor (or screed) and tiles are butted up to the kickboard. This saves on tile material and reduces the risk of tile damage during cabinet installation.

### Measurement Timing Summary

```
Demolition complete
        |
Structural work complete (walls, beams)
        |
Plumbing rough-in complete
        |
Electrical rough-in complete
        |
Gyprocking / plastering complete (set and sanded)
        |
Floor levelling / screeding complete
        |
  >>> CABINET MAKER TAKES FINAL SITE MEASURE <<<
        |
Cabinet order placed for manufacture
```

**Key rule:** Never order cabinets based on plan dimensions alone. Always wait for the site measure after all structural, plaster, and levelling work is complete.

## 2. Lead Times for Custom Cabinetry

Cabinetry is frequently the longest lead-time item in a kitchen or bathroom renovation. Failing to account for manufacturing lead times is one of the most common causes of project delays.

### Typical Manufacturing Lead Times — Australia (2025-2026)

| Tier | Description | Typical Lead Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Budget / Flat-pack** | Pre-manufactured modular cabinets (e.g., Kaboodle from Bunnings, Mitre 10 flat-pack ranges). Standard sizes, limited customisation. | **1-2 weeks** | Off-the-shelf from warehouse stock. Can sometimes be same-day pickup. Custom colours/sizes add 2-3 weeks. |
| **Mid-range custom** | Australian-made custom cabinets from local joinery shops. CNC-cut, edgebanded, standard hardware. Common finishes: melamine, laminate, vinyl wrap. | **4-6 weeks** | This is the most common tier for residential renovations. Lead time includes design finalisation, manufacture, and quality check. |
| **Premium custom** | Higher-end joinery with premium finishes (2-pac polyurethane spray, stone tops, soft-close throughout, integrated lighting). Often includes complex designs: curved elements, butler's pantry, integrated appliance housing. | **6-8 weeks** | Finish quality adds time — 2-pac spray painting alone adds 1-2 weeks for multiple coats and curing. |
| **Luxury bespoke** | Architect-designed, handcrafted joinery. Exotic timbers, specialist hardware (e.g., Blum SERVO-DRIVE), integrated technology, marble or specialty surfaces. | **8-12+ weeks** | Can extend to 16+ weeks for imported materials or one-off hardware. Often involves multiple workshop visits and prototyping. |

### 2025-2026 Market Conditions Impacting Lead Times

- Average waiting periods have increased by **10-15%** compared to 2023.
- **70% of builders** report delays in obtaining raw materials and critical components.
- **60% of builders** cite labour shortages as a primary contributor to delays.
- Material costs for cabinets have risen **8-12%** since 2024.
- Pre-Christmas period (October-December) typically adds 1-3 weeks to lead times.
- Post-holiday restart in January-February can also cause backlogs.

### Lead Time Planning Recommendation

| Project Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| Design phase (before demolition) | Select cabinet maker, agree on preliminary design, confirm approximate lead time. |
| During demolition/structural work | Finalise design selections (handles, finish, colour, appliance models). |
| After plaster complete | Cabinet maker takes final site measure. Order placed immediately. |
| During manufacturing wait | Complete painting (primer + first coat), floor levelling, any remaining prep. |

**Critical insight:** The manufacturing lead time for cabinets (4-8 weeks typically) creates a natural "dead zone" in the project. Smart scheduling uses this period to complete painting, floor prep, and other tasks so the site is ready the moment cabinets arrive.

## 3. Installation Sequence — Detailed Timeline

### Phase A: Before Cabinet Installation (What MUST Be Done First)

These tasks must be completed in approximately this order before cabinets can be installed.

| Step | Task | Why Before Cabinets | Typical Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Demolition complete** | Remove all existing cabinetry, fixtures, tiles, and finishes. Expose the room to its raw state. | 1-3 days |
| A2 | **Structural work complete** | Wall removal, beam installation, new wall framing. The room's footprint must be finalised. | 2-7 days |
| A3 | **Plumbing rough-in complete** | Waste pipes and water supply points positioned per the cabinet plan. Hot, cold, and waste for sink. Dishwasher water and waste. Island plumbing (if applicable) must be roughed in before the floor is closed. | 1-2 days |
| A4 | **Electrical rough-in complete** | Cable runs for GPOs, lighting, rangehood, oven, cooktop circuits. Positions must match the cabinet plan. | 1-2 days |
| A5 | **Gas rough-in** (if applicable) | Gas point for cooktop positioned per plan. Must be done by licensed gas fitter. | 0.5-1 day |
| A6 | **Gyprocking / plastering complete** | Plasterboard installed, joints taped, set, and sanded smooth. Cornices installed. This establishes the finished wall surface that cabinets will sit against. | 3-7 days (including drying/sanding) |
| A7 | **Painting: primer coat + first top coat** | Prime all walls and ceiling (even behind where cabinets will sit — bare plasterboard absorbs moisture and odours). Apply first top coat. Final coat is left until after cabinet installation. | 1-2 days |
| A8 | **Floor levelling / screeding** | Self-levelling compound or sand-cement screed to achieve a level floor plane. Essential for floor-standing cabinets to sit properly. | 1-2 days (plus curing time) |
| A9 | **Floor tiling** (if tiles run under cabinets) | If the design calls for tiles under cabinets, this must be done before installation. If tiles butt up to cabinets, this happens AFTER cabinet installation. | 1-3 days |

### Phase B: Cabinet Installation

| Step | Task | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | **Deliver cabinets to site** | Coordinate access, protect finished surfaces. Cabinets should be stored in a dry, clean area on-site. | 0.5 day |
| B2 | **Install wall cabinets (uppers)** | Typically installed first so the installer can work without base cabinets in the way. Secured to wall studs or with heavy-duty wall anchors through plasterboard. | 0.5-1 day |
| B3 | **Install base cabinets (lowers)** | Levelled and shimmed on the floor. Scribed to walls. Connected together. Plumbing and electrical rough-in points should be accessible through cabinet backs/bases. | 0.5-1 day |
| B4 | **Install tall cabinets** (pantry, oven tower) | Levelled and secured to wall. Oven tower must be checked against oven dimensions. | 0.5 day |
| B5 | **Install kickboards** | Fitted to base of floor cabinets. May be clipped or screwed. | 0.5 day |
| B6 | **Install doors, drawers, shelves** | Doors hung and adjusted. Drawer runners checked. Soft-close mechanisms tested. | 0.5-1 day |

**Typical total cabinet installation time:** 1-3 days depending on kitchen size and complexity.

### Phase C: After Cabinet Installation (What Happens Next)

This is the critical post-installation sequence where trades must be carefully coordinated.

| Step | Task | Timing After Cabinet Install | Duration | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **Stone benchtop template** (if stone/engineered stone) | 2-3 days after cabinet install | 30-60 minutes on-site | Cabinets MUST be installed, level, and not moving. Sink model and cooktop model must be confirmed (for cutout dimensions). Overhang support brackets must be installed by carpenter before template. |
| C2 | **Stone fabrication** | After template | 5-10 business days (up to 2-2.5 weeks pre-Christmas) | Fabricated off-site. CNC cut, polished, edges profiled. |
| C3 | **Splashback tiling** (if tiled splashback) | After cabinets installed; can begin before or after stone depending on design | 1-2 days | If tiled splashback: tiles typically start from top of benchtop level. If stone is in, tiler can tile right to the stone edge. If stone is not yet in, tiler leaves a gap at the bottom row. Many tilers prefer to tile AFTER stone is installed for a cleaner finish. |
| C4 | **Stone benchtop installation** | After fabrication complete | 1-3 hours on-site | Heavy — typically 2-3 installers. Sink cutout and cooktop cutout pre-cut at factory. Joined on-site with colour-matched adhesive. |
| C5 | **Second-fix plumbing** | After stone and sink are installed | 0.5-1 day | Connect sink (undermount or top-mount), install tapware, connect dishwasher water supply and waste, connect any island plumbing. |
| C6 | **Second-fix electrical** | After cabinets and stone installed | 0.5-1 day | Connect GPOs (including any that were behind cabinetry), install under-cabinet LED lighting, wire rangehood, connect oven and cooktop circuits. |
| C7 | **Final painting touch-ups** | After cabinets, stone, and splashback complete | 0.5 day | Final top coat on walls adjacent to cabinets. Touch up any screw holes, scuffs, or marks from installation. Cut in neatly where wall meets cabinet edges. |
| C8 | **Floor tiling** (if tiles butt up to cabinets) | After cabinets installed | 1-3 days | Tiles are cut to butt neatly against kickboard. Allows clean transition. |
| C9 | **Appliance installation** | After all services connected | 0.5-1 day | Oven slid into tower, cooktop dropped into benchtop cutout, dishwasher pushed into cavity and connected, rangehood secured and ducted. |
| C10 | **Handle/hardware installation** | Final step | 0.5 day | Handles drilled and fitted to doors and drawers. Some cabinet makers pre-drill; others drill on-site to client preference. |
| C11 | **Final clean and handover** | After all work complete | 0.5 day | Protective films removed from appliances and stone. Full clean of all surfaces. |

## 4. Coordination with Each Trade — Detailed Notes

### 4.1 Plumber

| Coordination Point | Detail | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Sink position** | Must be confirmed and marked on the cabinet plan before manufacture begins. Sink model (undermount vs top-mount, single vs double bowl) affects cabinet internal dimensions and cut-outs. | Before cabinet order |
| **Waste and water rough-in** | Hot, cold, and waste pipe positions must match the cabinet drawings exactly. Standard rough-in height for kitchen sink is 450-500mm from finished floor to centre of waste pipe. | During rough-in (Phase A3) |
| **Dishwasher position** | Water supply (typically teed off the kitchen sink cold supply) and waste connection (typically connected to sink waste via a dishwasher spigot or Y-fitting). Must be accessible through the adjacent cabinet. | During rough-in |
| **Island plumbing** | If island has a sink, waste and water must be roughed in BEFORE the floor slab or screed is closed. This is critical for slab-on-ground construction — once the slab is poured, relocating pipes is extremely costly. A cleanout should be accessible nearby. | Before slab/floor closure |
| **Laundry trough position** | Trough position and configuration (undermount, inset, freestanding) must be confirmed. Waste and water positions differ from kitchen sinks. | Before cabinet order |
| **Gas connection** (if applicable) | Gas bayonet or hard-pipe connection for gas cooktop. Position must match the cooktop location in the cabinet plan. Requires licensed gas fitter. | During rough-in |
| **Second-fix connection** | Plumber returns after stone benchtop and sink are installed to connect all tapware, waste plumbing, and appliance water/waste connections. Compliance certificate issued. | Phase C5 |

### 4.2 Electrician

| Coordination Point | Detail | When |
|---|---|---|
| **GPO positions relative to cabinets** | Power point positions must be marked on the cabinet plan. Typical locations: above benchtop (for small appliances), behind oven tower (for oven), behind cooktop (for electric cooktop), behind fridge cavity. GPOs behind cabinets often need cut-outs in the cabinet back. | Before rough-in |
| **Under-cabinet lighting** | LED strip lighting or puck lights under wall cabinets. Power feed location must be determined — typically a cable run inside the wall cabinet with a driver/transformer hidden inside the cabinet. | During rough-in |
| **Rangehood wiring** | Position and type must be confirmed: (a) **Integrated motor** — standard power point behind rangehood, typically at 1800-2000mm height; (b) **Inline/remote motor** — power point at motor location (in ceiling space or externally), plus low-voltage control wire to canopy. Inline motors reduce kitchen noise significantly but require additional wiring. | During rough-in |
| **Appliance circuits** | Dedicated circuits required for: oven (usually 20A or 32A depending on oven), electric cooktop (32A or 40A for larger models — can require 3-phase), dishwasher (10A). Circuit breaker allocation should be planned during rough-in. | During rough-in |
| **Island bench power** | Pop-up power outlets or fixed GPOs in island bench require a cable run through the floor (under slab or through floor cavity). Must be roughed in before floor is closed. | During rough-in, before floor closure |
| **In-cabinet lighting** | Internal sensor lights (motion-activated LEDs inside pantry, drawers). Low voltage, often battery-operated, but hardwired options require a power feed into the cabinet. | During rough-in if hardwired |
| **Second-fix electrical** | Electrician returns after cabinets and benchtop to connect all GPOs, install and wire under-cabinet lights, connect rangehood, connect oven and cooktop. Compliance certificate issued (required in all Australian states). | Phase C6 |

### 4.3 Stone Mason (Benchtop Fabricator)

| Coordination Point | Detail | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Template timing** | Template can ONLY be done after cabinets are installed AND confirmed level. Nothing must move between template and installation — even a 2-3mm shift can cause a misfit. | 2-3 days after cabinet install (Phase C1) |
| **Sink model confirmation** | The exact sink model must be confirmed before template. The stone mason needs the sink (or a template/spec sheet for it) to create the precise cutout. Undermount sinks require the actual sink to be left on-site for the templater. | Before template day |
| **Cooktop model confirmation** | Cooktop cutout dimensions vary by model. The stone mason needs the exact model number or spec sheet. | Before template day |
| **Waterfall end details** | If the design includes a waterfall end (stone running down the side of the cabinet to the floor), this must be communicated to the stone mason AND the cabinet maker. The cabinet end panel must be built to receive the stone, and the stone mason needs the exact height measurement. | During design phase, confirmed at template |
| **Overhang support brackets** | If the benchtop has an overhang (breakfast bar, island seating), the carpenter/cabinet maker must install steel support brackets before the template appointment. The stone mason will measure to these brackets. Standard overhang support: required for overhangs exceeding 300mm. | Before template |
| **Edge profile** | Edge profile selection (square, bullnose, bevelled, mitre) confirmed before fabrication. | Before template |
| **Seam/join locations** | For large benchtops, the stone mason will identify join locations at template. These should avoid sink cutouts and high-use areas. | At template |

### 4.4 Tiler

| Coordination Point | Detail | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Splashback tiling timing** | Splashback tiles are installed AFTER cabinets are in place (wall cabinets define the top line; base cabinets/benchtop define the bottom line). Typically done after stone benchtop installation for the cleanest result. | Phase C3 (after cabinets, ideally after stone) |
| **Tile behind cabinets?** | Standard practice in Australia: tiles are NOT installed behind cabinets. Tiles are only installed in the visible splashback zone (between benchtop and wall cabinets, typically 500-600mm high). Exception: if the design has open shelving instead of wall cabinets, the tile may extend to the ceiling. | N/A — splashback area only |
| **Floor tile: under cabinets or not?** | Two approaches exist — see table below. | Before cabinet install or after — depends on approach |
| **Transition detail** | Where floor tile meets the cabinet kickboard, a clean butt joint is typical. Silicone (colour-matched) may be used at the junction. No tile trim is normally required. | During floor tiling |

#### Floor Tiling: Under Cabinets vs. Butting Up — Pros and Cons

| Factor | Tiles Under Cabinets | Tiles Butt Up to Cabinets |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Higher — more tile material and labour for areas hidden under cabinets. | Lower — tile only the visible floor area. |
| **Installation order** | Floor tiling BEFORE cabinet installation. | Floor tiling AFTER cabinet installation. |
| **Risk of damage** | Tiles may be damaged during cabinet installation (heavy units dragged across floor). Requires protection. | No risk — tiles are laid after cabinets are in. |
| **Future flexibility** | Cabinets can be rearranged or removed without exposing bare subfloor. | If cabinets are removed in future, untiled areas are exposed. |
| **Water protection** | Continuous tile surface under appliances (dishwasher leaks protected). | Potential for water to reach subfloor if a leak pools under cabinets. |
| **Height consistency** | Floor level is consistent across the room. Appliances (dishwasher, fridge) sit at the same height as adjacent floor. | May create a slight step where tile meets the subfloor under cabinets. Dishwasher height may need adjusting. |
| **Australian common practice** | More common in new builds (tiles laid before any fitout). | More common in renovations (cabinets go in first, tiles fill around). |

**Recommendation for ScopeAI:** Default to "tiles butt up to cabinets" for renovation scope of works unless the client specifically requests tiles under cabinets. Note both approaches in the scope and explain the trade-off.

### 4.5 Painter

| Coordination Point | Detail | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Primer coat** | All walls and ceilings (including behind where cabinets will sit) must be primed after plastering. Bare plasterboard absorbs moisture and odours — primer seals the surface. | Phase A7 (before cabinets) |
| **First top coat** | Apply first top coat to all walls and ceiling before cabinet installation. This ensures full coverage without needing to cut in around installed cabinets. | Phase A7 (before cabinets) |
| **Final top coat** | After cabinets, stone, and splashback are installed, the painter returns for the final top coat. This covers any scuffs, marks, or imperfections caused during installation. The painter cuts in neatly where paint meets the cabinet edges. | Phase C7 (after cabinets + stone + splashback) |
| **Cabinet painting** | Modern Australian kitchens with painted (2-pac polyurethane) cabinet doors have the doors sprayed in the cabinet maker's workshop, NOT on-site. On-site painting of cabinetry is rare and produces an inferior finish compared to workshop spray. | During manufacture (off-site) |
| **Ceiling painting** | Ceiling should be fully painted (all coats) before cabinets go in, as access is easier. | Phase A7 |

---

## 5. Critical Hold Points

These are non-negotiable checkpoints where work MUST NOT proceed until the prior condition is met. Violating these hold points will result in rework, delays, and cost blowouts.

| Hold Point | Rule | Consequence of Violation |
|---|---|---|
| **HP1: Do NOT order cabinets before final site measure** | Final measurements must be taken after ALL structural work, plumbing/electrical rough-in, plastering, and floor levelling are complete. | Cabinets will not fit. Walls may be in different positions, thicknesses may be wrong, floor levels may differ from plan. Rework cost: $2,000-$10,000+ depending on extent. |
| **HP2: Do NOT template stone before cabinets are installed AND level** | Stone templating can only happen once cabinets are permanently installed and confirmed level and secure. | Stone will be fabricated to incorrect dimensions. A new template and re-fabrication will be required. Rework cost: $1,500-$5,000+ and 2-3 weeks delay. |
| **HP3: Do NOT tile splashback before cabinets are installed** | Splashback tile position is determined by the wall cabinet bottom edge and the benchtop surface. Without cabinets, the tiler is guessing. | Tiles will be in the wrong position — either too high, too low, or misaligned with cabinet edges. Full strip-out and re-tile required. |
| **HP4: Do NOT connect second-fix plumbing/electrical until benchtop and sink are installed** | Plumber and electrician return for second fix (fit-off) only after the benchtop is installed and the sink is in place. | Premature connection risks damage to tapware and plumbing during subsequent stone installation. Connections may not align with final positions. |
| **HP5: Do NOT install stone benchtop before overhang brackets are fitted** | Carpenter/cabinet maker must install steel support brackets for any overhangs exceeding 300mm before the stone templater arrives. | Stone overhangs without support will crack or collapse. Structural failure risk. |
| **HP6: Do NOT begin cabinet manufacture before sink, cooktop, and appliance models are confirmed** | The cabinet maker needs confirmed model numbers for the sink, cooktop, oven, dishwasher, and rangehood to ensure internal dimensions, cutouts, and ventilation clearances are correct. | Cabinets may not accommodate the appliances. Internal cutouts, clearances, or cavity sizes will be wrong. |
| **HP7: Do NOT close the floor (screed/slab) before island plumbing is roughed in** | If the design includes an island with a sink, waste and water lines must be installed in the floor before screeding or slab closure. | Cutting into a cured slab to add plumbing is extremely costly ($3,000-$8,000+) and time-consuming. |

### Bathroom Vanity Variation

For bathroom vanities, the sequence is similar but compressed:

```
Demolition > Waterproofing > Plumbing rough-in > Electrical rough-in >
Plastering > Floor + wall tiling > Vanity installation >
Stone vanity top template > Stone fabrication + install >
Second-fix plumbing (basin, tapware) > Second-fix electrical >
Mirror + accessories > Final clean
```

**Key difference:** Bathroom waterproofing (per AS 3740) must be completed and certified BEFORE any tiling. This is an additional hold point not present in kitchen renovations.

### Laundry Variation

For laundry cabinetry, the sequence follows the kitchen model but is typically simpler:

```
Demolition > Plumbing rough-in (trough, washing machine) >
Electrical rough-in (GPOs, dryer circuit) > Plastering >
Painting > Cabinet installation > Benchtop (laminate or stone) >
Second-fix plumbing (trough, taps, washing machine taps) >
Second-fix electrical > Splashback (if applicable) > Final clean
```
