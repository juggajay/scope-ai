# Carpentry & Joinery Pricing Guidance for Australian Residential Renovations

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Provide ballpark PC (Provisional Cost) sums for ScopeAI-generated Scope of Works documents covering carpentry and joinery trades in Australian residential renovations.
**Confidence Note:** All pricing is rated **MEDIUM confidence**. Prices are approximate, derived from industry surveys, trade publications, renovation forums, and supplier guides (2024-2026 data). Rates change frequently due to labour market conditions, material supply chains, and regional demand. Always recommend clients obtain at least 2-3 quotes from licensed tradespeople.

**Geographic Basis:** Australian capital cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane) as of 2025-2026.
- Regional areas may be **10-20% less** than capital city prices.
- Remote areas may be **20-40% more** than capital city prices.

**All prices are in AUD and exclusive of GST unless otherwise noted.**

---

## General Notes for ScopeAI PC Sums

1. **These prices are indicative only** and should be presented in Scope of Works documents as Provisional Cost (PC) sums, clearly marked as estimates subject to final quotation.

2. **Regional adjustments:**
   - Capital cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane): use prices as stated.
   - Regional centres (e.g., Newcastle, Geelong, Gold Coast): reduce by 10-15%.
   - Rural/remote areas: increase by 20-40%.

3. **Market conditions:** The Australian renovation market has experienced significant cost inflation since 2020 (estimated 20-35% increase). Prices in this guide reflect 2025-2026 market conditions.

4. **Scope complexity:** Simple, straightforward scopes will tend toward the lower end of ranges. Complex work (heritage, multi-level, restricted access, high-end finishes) will tend toward the upper end or exceed stated ranges.

5. **Exclusions commonly missed in carpentry scopes:**
   - Painting and finishing (unless specified)
   - Plumbing and electrical modifications
   - Council permits and engineering
   - Scaffolding and temporary works
   - Asbestos testing and removal (pre-1990 homes)
   - Skip bins and waste removal

6. **Recommended approach for PC sums:** Use the mid-point of the mid-range tier as the default PC sum, with a note that final pricing is subject to trade quotation.
