## 1. NCC (National Construction Code) / BCA Requirements for Residential Carpentry

**Confidence: HIGH**

The NCC (formerly the BCA) is Australia's primary regulatory framework for building. NCC 2022 Volume 2 (Housing Provisions) and the ABCB Housing Provisions standard apply to Class 1 (houses, townhouses) and Class 10 (garages, carports, sheds) buildings.

### 1.1 Relevant NCC 2022 Volume 2 Sections for Timber Framing

| NCC 2022 Section | Topic | Key Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Part H1 (Structure) | Structural performance | All structural elements must comply with Performance Requirement H1P1 |
| Part 2.2 | Structural provisions | Timber framing deemed-to-satisfy via AS 1684.2, AS 1684.3, AS 1684.4, or AS 1720.1 |
| Part 3.4 | Termite risk management | Termite management system required in designated risk areas |
| Part 7.5 | Timber and composite wall cladding | Cladding fixing to framing per AS 1684 or NASH Standard |
| Part 9 (Fire Safety) | Fire separation and protection | FRL requirements for party walls, garage walls, external walls near boundaries |
| Part 9.2 | Fire separation of external walls | Walls within certain distances of boundaries must achieve FRL 60/60/60 |
| Part 9.3 | Fire protection of separating walls and floors | Party walls between attached dwellings and garage/habitable separations |

### 1.2 Fire Ratings for Walls and Ceilings (Residential)

| Element | FRL Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Party wall (separating wall between Class 1 buildings) | 60/60/60 minimum | Must extend to underside of non-combustible roof covering |
| Garage wall adjacent to habitable rooms (non-appurtenant Class 10a) | 60/60/60 | Applies where Class 10a garage is not appurtenant to the dwelling |
| External wall within 900mm of boundary | 60/60/60 from outside | Non-openable, non-combustible construction |
| External wall 900mm-1.5m from boundary | 60/60/60 from outside | Openings limited to certain percentages |
| Floor/ceiling between dwelling and non-appurtenant garage below | 60 minutes resistance to incipient spread of fire | Ceiling must achieve 60-minute rating |
| Stairway enclosure walls (internal walls bounding a required stair) | 60/60/60 | Per NCC Table 5 for rated stairs |

**FRL (Fire Resistance Level)** is expressed as three numbers: Structural Adequacy / Integrity / Insulation (in minutes).

### 1.3 Structural Timber Grades and Fixing Requirements

The NCC deems timber framing to satisfy structural performance requirements when designed and constructed in accordance with:
- **AS 1720.1** — Timber Structures: Design Methods (engineered design)
- **AS 1684.2** — Residential Timber-Framed Construction: Non-Cyclonic Areas
- **AS 1684.3** — Residential Timber-Framed Construction: Cyclonic Areas
- **AS 1684.4** — Simplified Non-Cyclonic Areas (limited wind classifications)

All structural timber must be stress-graded to AS 1720.1 or machine-graded (MGP system). Fixings (nails, screws, bolts, framing connectors) must comply with the fixing schedules in AS 1684.2 and relevant connector standards.

---

## 2. AS 1684 — Residential Timber-Framed Construction

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 2.1 What This Standard Covers

AS 1684 is the primary deemed-to-satisfy standard for residential timber framing in Australia. It is a four-part standard:

| Part | Title | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| AS 1684.1 | Design Criteria | Design basis for calculating timber sizes and forces; reference for designers and product manufacturers |
| AS 1684.2 | Non-Cyclonic Areas | Detailed building practices, span tables, bracing, and tie-down for wind classifications N1 to N4 |
| AS 1684.3 | Cyclonic Areas | Building practices, span tables, bracing, and tie-down for wind classifications C1, C2, C3 |
| AS 1684.4 | Simplified — Non-Cyclonic Areas | Simplified span tables and procedures for lower wind classification areas |

### 2.2 When It Applies to Renovations

AS 1684 applies to:
- **New framing** in Class 1 and Class 10 buildings (new construction or additions)
- **Modifications** to existing framing where structural members are added, removed, or altered
- **Alterations** that change load paths (e.g., removing a wall, adding a window opening)

For renovations, if existing framing is being left undisturbed it does not need to retrospectively comply. However, any **new framing** or **modified framing** must comply with the current edition of AS 1684 (currently AS 1684.2:2021).

### 2.3 Simplified vs Engineered Design Paths

| Design Path | Standard | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Simplified (Deemed-to-Satisfy)** | AS 1684.2 or AS 1684.4 | Standard residential construction within span table limits; most common for typical houses |
| **Engineered Design** | AS 1720.1 (with AS 1684.1 criteria) | When spans exceed table limits, unusual load conditions, or non-standard configurations |

Most residential carpentry uses the simplified path (AS 1684.2 span tables). Engineered design is required when:
- Spans exceed those listed in the tables
- Point loads from upper storeys or concentrated loads exist
- Non-standard configurations (cantilevers, unusual roof forms)
- The building is in a cyclonic area requiring specific engineering

### 2.4 Key Requirements

**Stud sizes and spacing:**
- Common studs: typically 90x35mm or 90x45mm for single-storey; 90x45mm or 70x45mm depending on load and height
- Standard stud spacing: **450mm** or **600mm** centres (450mm is most common for brick veneer and sheet cladding)
- Stud height: standard 2.4m wall height; taller walls may require larger stud sizes

**Noggings (dwangs/nogs):**
- Required at maximum **1350mm** centres vertically
- For standard 2.4m walls: one row of noggings at mid-height
- For walls over 2.7m: two rows of noggings required
- Noggings are **not** required to be stress-graded
- Must be full depth of stud and tightly fitted or fixed with skew nails

**Top and bottom plates:**
- Top plate: minimum same width as studs; typically double top plate for loadbearing walls
- Bottom plate: same width as studs; must be fixed to slab or bearers per fixing schedule
- Plates must be continuous or joined over studs with appropriate connections

**Bracing requirements:**
- Bracing resists lateral (racking) loads from wind
- Bracing capacity is calculated based on wind classification, roof area, wall height, and building dimensions
- Common bracing methods: structural plywood (rated to kN/m), metal strap bracing, proprietary bracing systems
- Bracing must be distributed on each side of the building and each storey
- AS 1684.2:2021 includes revised bracing calculation methods

## 3. AS 4386 — Domestic Kitchen Installations (Cabinetry in the Built-In Environment)

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 3.1 What This Standard Covers

AS 4386:2018 replaced the earlier two-part AS/NZS 4386.1 and 4386.2. It specifies minimum requirements for the **construction and installation** of cabinets in the built-in environment for both commercial and domestic applications.

### 3.2 Key Requirements

| Requirement Area | Details |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | Applies to kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, laundry cabinets, and other built-in cabinetry (domestic and commercial) |
| **Construction** | Minimum material thicknesses, structural adequacy of carcases, shelf loading capacity, drawer construction |
| **Installation** | Cabinets must be fixed securely to walls; fixings must be into studs or use appropriate wall anchors rated for the load |
| **Wall fixing** | Overhead (wall) cabinets must be fixed with a minimum of 2 fixings per cabinet into structural framing or masonry; fixings must support the cabinet plus its rated load |
| **Benchtop support** | Benchtops must be adequately supported; cantilevers and overhangs must not exceed specified limits without additional support |
| **Appliance clearances** | Minimum clearances between cooktop burners and combustible surfaces must be maintained per manufacturer specifications and AS/NZS 4386 |
| **Ventilation** | Built-in ovens require adequate ventilation clearances as specified |
| **Ergonomics** | Appendix A provides ergonomic design guidance (bench heights, reach distances) |
| **Moisture resistance** | Cabinets in wet areas (under sinks, near dishwashers) must use moisture-resistant materials or be adequately sealed |

### 3.3 Compliance Notes for ScopeAI

- Kitchen cabinetry installation in a scope of works should reference AS 4386:2018
- Fixings to walls must penetrate into studs or use engineered anchors
- Overhead cabinets: minimum 2 structural fixings per unit; typically 4 for large units
- All cabinetry near water sources should use moisture-resistant board (MR MDF or marine ply)

## 4. Timber Grades and Species

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 4.1 Machine Graded Pine (MGP) Grades

MGP grades are determined by machine testing of stiffness (Modulus of Elasticity). The number indicates the minimum MOE in units of 1000 MPa.

| Grade | Min MOE (MPa) | Typical Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MGP10** | 10,000 | Wall studs, top/bottom plates, noggings, roof battens, light rafters | Most common residential framing grade; standard for wall framing |
| **MGP12** | 12,000 | Floor joists, rafters, lintels, bearers in lighter applications | Higher stiffness; used where deflection is critical (floors) |
| **MGP15** | 15,000 | Long-span floor joists, bearers, rafters, lintels | Premium structural grade; used for demanding structural applications |

### 4.2 F-Grades (Stress Grades)

F-grades are based on the bending strength of timber. The number indicates the characteristic bending stress in MPa. Used primarily for visually-graded hardwoods and some softwoods.

| Grade | Bending Strength (MPa) | Typical Species | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F5** | 5 | Low-grade softwood | Non-structural, temporary bracing, form-work |
| **F7** | 7 | Radiata pine (unseasoned), some imported softwoods | General framing (studs, plates); similar to MGP10 for bending but lower stiffness |
| **F8** | 8 | Better-grade softwood, some hardwoods | General purpose structural; bearers, joists in lighter applications |
| **F14** | 14 | Unseasoned hardwoods (spotted gum, ironbark, blackbutt) | Bearers, joists, rafters, lintels, posts — hardwood framing |
| **F17** | 17 | Unseasoned hardwoods (ironbark, spotted gum, tallowwood) | Heavy-duty bearers, joists, posts, stumps; premium hardwood structural grade |
| **F22** | 22 | Seasoned (kiln-dried) hardwoods | High-performance structural; engineered applications |
| **F27** | 27 | Seasoned select hardwoods | Premium engineered structural; high-load applications |

| **Spotted Gum** | F14-F27 | Naturally durable (Class 1-2) | Bearers, joists, decking, structural posts |
| **Ironbark** | F17-F34 | Naturally durable (Class 1) | Heavy-duty bearers, stumps, posts, high-load structural |
| **Blackbutt** | F14-F22 | Naturally durable (Class 1-2) | Bearers, joists, structural framing, decking, BAL-rated cladding |
| **Tallowwood** | F14-F22 | Naturally durable (Class 1) | Bearers, joists, decking; excellent durability |
| **Hoop Pine** | F7-F11 | Requires treatment | Interior framing, plywood manufacture |
| **LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber)** | Various (engineered) | As specified | Long-span beams, lintels, bearers; engineered product |
| **Glulam** | Various (engineered) | As specified | Large beams, portal frames, feature elements |

### 4.4 Recommended Grade by Application

| Application | Recommended Grade (Softwood) | Recommended Grade (Hardwood) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wall studs** | MGP10 | F8 minimum | 90x35 or 90x45 typical |
| **Top/bottom plates** | MGP10 | F8 minimum | Same section as studs |
| **Floor joists** | MGP12 or MGP15 | F14-F17 | Size per span tables |
| **Bearers** | MGP12 or MGP15 | F14-F17 | Hardwood preferred for subfloor |

## 6. Building Certification — Frame Inspections

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 6.1 Frame Inspection Requirements by State

| State | Frame Inspection Mandatory? | Legislation | Who Inspects? | Trigger for Building Approval |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | **Yes** — Critical Stage Inspection | Environmental Planning & Assessment Regulation 2000 | Principal Certifier (private certifier or council) | Any development requiring a Construction Certificate or Complying Development Certificate |
| **VIC** | **Yes** — Mandatory Inspection Stage | Building Act 1993 / Building Regulations 2018 | Registered Building Surveyor (private or municipal) | Any work requiring a Building Permit |
| **QLD** | **Yes** — Mandatory Inspection | Building Regulation 2021, s44 | Private building certifier or council | Any assessable building work requiring a Building Approval |

### 6.2 What Triggers the Need for Building Approval / DA

| Work Type | Approval Required? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| New house construction | **Yes** — Development Approval + Construction Certificate / Building Permit | All states |
| Extension or addition (new rooms, additional floor) | **Yes** — DA/BA + Building Permit | Structural work always requires approval |
| Internal wall removal (loadbearing) | **Yes** — Building Permit/approval at minimum | May not require DA if no change to external appearance, but structural work requires building approval |
| Internal wall removal (non-loadbearing) | **Generally No** — but check local requirements | Some councils require notification |
| New deck or pergola (attached to house) | **Yes** in most states | Exempt development provisions may apply for small structures |
| Kitchen renovation (no structural changes) | **Generally No** | Unless plumbing or electrical work triggers other approvals |
| Re-roofing (like-for-like) | **Generally No** | Unless changing roof structure or material type |
| New garage (Class 10a) | **Yes** — typically Complying Development or DA | Depends on size and setbacks |

### 6.3 What is Inspected at Frame Stage

The frame inspection checks:
- Correct member sizes (studs, joists, rafters, beams) per approved plans
- Correct spacing of framing members
- Correct bracing installation and location
- Correct fixing (nail patterns, framing connectors, hold-down bolts)
- Correct placement of lintels, trimmers, and jamb studs

## 7. Termite Treatment Requirements

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 7.1 Hazard Levels (H-Levels)

| H-Level | Hazard | Environment | Biological Hazard | Typical Applications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **H1** | Low | Above ground, inside, well-ventilated, protected from weather | Insects (borers) — NOT termites | Interior framing in southern Australia (low-termite-risk only), furniture timber |
| **H2** | Moderate | Above ground, inside, protected from weather | Borers AND termites | Interior framing (wall studs, ceiling joists, roof framing) in termite-risk areas — **most common for residential framing** |
| **H3** | High | Above ground, exposed to weather (periodic wetting) | Decay fungi, borers, termites | Fascia boards, weatherboards, external cladding battens, pergola beams (above ground), fence rails |
| **H4** | Very High | In-ground contact or continually damp | Severe decay fungi, borers, termites | Fence posts, retaining walls, deck posts in ground, garden edging, landscaping timbers |
| **H5** | Extreme | In-ground contact in critical applications, or fresh water | Very severe decay, borers, termites | Structural posts in ground, house stumps, cooling tower fill, jetty cross-braces |
| **H6** | Marine | Immersed in sea water | Marine borers, decay, termites | Marine piles, jetty piles, boat hulls |

### 7.2 When New Timber Framing Requires Treatment

| Location | Treatment Required |
|---|---|
| Framing in a designated termite-risk area | Minimum **H2** treatment for all concealed framing (studs, plates, joists, rafters) |
| Framing in Tasmania or parts of southern Victoria (low risk) | H1 may be acceptable; check local authority |
| External timber above ground (exposed to weather) | Minimum **H3** treatment |
| Timber in ground contact | Minimum **H4** treatment |
| Timber in ground contact in critical structural applications | **H5** treatment |
| Subfloor framing (bearers, joists) in well-ventilated subfloor | H2 minimum; H3 if risk of wetting |

### 7.3 NCC Requirements for Termite Management

The NCC (Part 3.4 of Housing Provisions / Part 3.1.4 of older Volume 2) requires a termite management system for all new Class 1 and Class 10 buildings in designated termite-risk areas. The system must be one or a combination of:

| Method | Description | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical barrier** | Graded granite aggregate, stainless steel mesh (e.g., Termimesh), or sheet membrane (e.g., Kordon) installed at slab penetrations, slab edges, and joints | AS 3660.1:2014 |
| **Chemical barrier** | Soil treatment with approved termiticide applied to trenches around the perimeter and under slab | AS 3660.1:2014 |
| **Reticulation system** | In-ground piping system allowing re-application of termiticide without excavation | AS 3660.1:2014 |
| **Treated timber** | Use of H2 (or higher) treated timber for all framing elements | AS 1604 series |
| **Naturally durable timber** | Use of Class 1 or Class 2 durability timber for critical elements | AS 5604 |

**Important:** A termite management system alone does not prevent termite entry; it is designed to **deter** and **detect**. Regular inspections (at least annually) are critical and should be noted in any scope of works.

### 7.4 State Variations — High Risk Termite Zones

| State/Region | Termite Risk Level | Key Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **QLD (all)** | **Very High to High** | All new buildings require termite management system. H2 minimum for all framing. Physical or chemical barrier mandatory. Annual inspections strongly recommended. |
| **Northern NSW (north of Newcastle)** | **High** | Same as QLD requirements effectively. H2 framing mandatory. Full barrier system required. |
| **NSW (Sydney and south)** | **Moderate to High** | Termite management system required in most areas. H2 framing standard practice. |
| **NT (Northern Territory)** | **Very High** | Highest risk zone in Australia. Stringent termite management requirements. |
| **WA (north of Perth)** | **High to Very High** | Full termite management system required. H2 framing mandatory. |
| **WA (Perth and south)** | **Moderate** | Termite management system required in most areas. |
| **VIC (northern regions)** | **Moderate** | Termite management generally required. |
| **VIC (Melbourne and south)** | **Low to Moderate** | Some areas may not require management system; check with local authority. |
| **SA (Adelaide region)** | **Moderate** | Termite management system generally required. |
| **TAS** | **Low** | Termites generally not considered a risk. H1 treatment may be acceptable. NCC does not mandate termite management system for Tasmania. |

## 8. Fire Rating Requirements in Residential Construction

**Confidence: HIGH**

### 8.1 Party Walls (Attached Dwellings — Duplexes, Townhouses, Row Houses)

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **FRL** | Minimum **60/60/60** |
| **Construction** | Must be non-combustible from ground to underside of roof covering |
| **Extension** | Must extend to the underside of a non-combustible roof covering or non-combustible eaves lining |
| **Discontinuous construction** | Where acoustic separation is also required (NCC Part 10), the wall may need to be discontinuous (double stud or staggered stud on separate plates) |
| **Penetrations** | All penetrations (pipes, cables, ducts) must be fire-stopped to maintain the FRL |
| **Materials** | Typically achieved with steel or timber studs lined both sides with fire-rated plasterboard (e.g., 2x 13mm Fyrchek or 1x 16mm Fyrchek per side, depending on system) |

### 8.2 Garage Walls Adjacent to Habitable Rooms

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Common wall between attached garage and dwelling** | Must achieve **60/60/60** where the garage is a non-appurtenant Class 10a building |
| **Garage ceiling (where habitable room above)** | Ceiling must achieve 60-minute resistance to incipient spread of fire |
| **Self-closing door** | Door between garage and dwelling must be self-closing and have an FRL not less than the wall; minimum solid-core door |
| **Practical note** | Many attached garages are treated as appurtenant Class 10a, which may reduce requirements — but best practice and many certifiers require fire separation regardless |

### 8.3 Stairway Enclosures in Multi-Storey Residential

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Internal walls bounding a required fire-isolated stairway** | FRL **60/60/60** (per NCC Table 5) |
| **Doors to fire-isolated stairways** | Must be fire-rated and self-closing |
| **Applies to** | Multi-storey Class 2 (apartments), Class 3 (boarding houses), and some two-storey Class 1 configurations where a fire-isolated exit is required |
| **Single-storey Class 1** | No fire-isolated stairway typically required for a standard two-storey house |

### 8.4 Fire-Rated Plasterboard Requirements

| Product | Thickness | Typical Use | System Rating |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard plasterboard** | 13mm | General wall and ceiling lining (non-rated) | No FRL by itself |
| **Fire-rated plasterboard (Fyrchek or equivalent)** | 13mm | Fire-rated wall systems — typically 2 layers per side for 60/60/60 | FRL achieved as part of a tested system |
| **Fire-rated plasterboard (Fyrchek or equivalent)** | 16mm | Fire-rated wall and ceiling systems — may achieve 60/60/60 with single layer per side in some tested systems | FRL achieved as part of a tested system |
| **Shaft liner** | 25mm | Fire-rated shaft walls, party walls | Proprietary system |

**Key notes:**
- Fire ratings are achieved by the **system** (stud + lining + fixings), not by the plasterboard alone
- Always reference manufacturer's tested systems (e.g., CSR Gyprock Redbook, Knauf systems)
- Standard 13mm plasterboard (non-fire-rated) is deemed non-combustible and can line walls where non-combustibility is required but no FRL is needed
- Fire-rated plasterboard is identified by pink face paper (Fyrchek) or equivalent marking

## 9. Warranty Requirements for Cabinetry

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

### 9.1 Statutory Warranty Periods by State

| State | Structural Defects | Non-Structural Defects (incl. Cabinetry) | Legislation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NSW** | **6 years** from completion | **2 years** from completion | Home Building Act 1989 | Cabinetry installed as part of building work falls under the 2-year warranty for non-structural defects |
| **VIC** | **6 years** (insurance); 10 years (statutory warranty overall) | **2 years** (insurance) | Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995 / Building Act 1993 | Statutory warranties enforceable for 10 years from occupancy permit; insurance claims limited to 6yr structural / 2yr non-structural |
| **QLD** | **6 years, 6 months** from completion | **1 year** from completion | Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991 | Non-structural cabinetry defects must be claimed within 1 year |
| **SA** | **5 years** from completion | **5 years** from completion (no separate category) | Building Work Contractors Act 1995 | Single warranty period for all building work — 5 years |
| **WA** | **6 years** from practical completion | **6 years** from practical completion | Home Building Contracts Act 1991 | Complaints must be made within 6 years; strictly enforced |
| **TAS** | **6 years** from completion | **6 years** from completion | Building Act 2016 / Residential Building Work Contracts and Dispute Resolution Act 2016 | 6-year warranty; 10-year long-stop for certain actions |

### 9.2 Australian Consumer Law (ACL) Guarantees

The ACL provides automatic guarantees that apply **in addition to** (not instead of) statutory building warranties:

| Guarantee | Application to Cabinetry |
|---|---|
| **Acceptable quality** | Cabinetry must be of a standard a reasonable consumer would expect — fit for purpose, safe, durable, free from defects |
| **Fit for purpose** | If the homeowner specifies a purpose (e.g., "I need soft-close drawers" or "this must be moisture resistant"), the cabinetry must meet that specification |
| **Match description** | Cabinetry must match any description provided (e.g., "stone benchtop," "Blum hardware," "2-pac finish") |
| **Match sample** | If a sample was provided, the finished product must match |
| **Reasonable durability** | Cabinetry is expected to last a reasonable period; what is "reasonable" depends on price, quality level, and what was represented |
| **Remedies** | Major failure: consumer can reject and get refund or replacement. Minor failure: supplier can choose to repair, replace, or refund. |

**Important:** ACL guarantees have no fixed expiry; they last for a "reasonable" period depending on the nature of the goods. For kitchen cabinetry, 5-10 years would generally be considered reasonable for the carcases, with hardware lasting longer.

### 9.3 Typical Manufacturer Warranties for Hardware

| Manufacturer | Product | Warranty Period | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Blum** | Hinges (CLIP top, etc.) | **Lifetime** (original purchaser) | Covers defects in material and workmanship; does not cover misuse or normal wear |
| **Blum** | Drawer runners (TANDEMBOX, MOVENTO, etc.) | **Lifetime** (original purchaser) | Same conditions |
