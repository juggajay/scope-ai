## 1. Vanity Types

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer data and industry standard dimensions)

### 1.1 Wall-Hung (Floating) Vanities

Wall-hung vanities are mounted to the wall with no contact with the floor. They create a modern, open appearance and make floor cleaning easier -- particularly important in wet areas where water pooling on the floor is common.

#### Mounting Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Wall backing** | Must be fixed to wall studs (timber or steel). If studs do not align with vanity bracket positions, horizontal timber nogging (blocking) must be installed between studs during rough-in |
| **Plywood backing (optional)** | 18mm structural plywood can be fixed across studs behind the vanity zone to provide continuous mounting support. Plywood must be fixed to studs, not just plasterboard |
| **Mounting bracket types** | Steel rail system (preferred -- allows lateral adjustment), heavy-duty L-bracket, or concealed French cleat system |
| **Bracket material** | Stainless steel or corrosion-inhibited coated steel required due to bathroom humidity |
| **Fixing method** | Lag bolts or heavy-duty coach screws into studs. Minimum 2 fixing points per 600mm of vanity width |
| **Weight capacity** | Typical wall-hung vanity weighs 30-70kg empty. Must also support basin, water, and user leaning weight. Design for minimum 100-120kg total load |
| **Typical mounting height** | Bottom of vanity at 280-350mm above finished floor level (AFL). Top of vanity at 850-900mm AFL |

#### Scope Implications

- **Carpenter** must install timber nogging / plywood backing during rough-in (before plasterboard is installed)
- If renovation of an existing bathroom, the plasterboard may need to be removed to install backing -- coordinate with plasterer
- Plumber must rough-in waste and water supply to suit wall-hung configuration (higher waste outlet, typically 450-500mm AFL)

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> Wall-hung vanity installation requires TWO carpentry visits: (1) rough-in stage to install wall backing/nogging, and (2) fit-off stage to mount the vanity after tiling is complete. The scope must include both stages.

### 1.2 Floor-Standing Vanities

Floor-standing vanities sit directly on the finished floor. They are simpler to install and do not require wall backing or structural support beyond basic fixing to prevent tipping.

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Installation** | Placed on finished floor after tiling. Secured to wall with anti-tip screws (into studs or plasterboard anchors for light units) |
| **Floor preparation** | Floor tiles must be laid flat and level in the vanity zone. Some installers prefer to tile under the vanity; others tile up to it |
| **Plumbing** | Waste exits through the floor or through the rear wall at low level (~250mm AFL) |
| **Weight distribution** | Weight distributed to floor -- no wall structural requirements beyond anti-tip fixing |
| **Adjustable feet** | Most floor-standing vanities include adjustable feet (10-20mm range) to level on uneven floors |

### 1.3 Single Basin vs Double Basin Vanities

| Configuration | Typical Width Range | Common Widths | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single basin** | 600mm - 1200mm | 600, 750, 900, 1200mm | Most common for standard bathrooms and ensuites |
| **Double basin** | 1200mm - 1800mm | 1200, 1500, 1800mm | Requires wider benchtop, two waste outlets, two sets of taps. Common in master ensuites |
| **Compact / cloakroom** | 400mm - 600mm | 400, 450, 500mm | For powder rooms and small toilets. Often wall-hung |

### 1.4 Standard Vanity Dimensions

| Dimension | Standard Range | Most Common | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Height** (floor to top of benchtop) | 850mm - 900mm | 850mm (vanity unit) + basin sits above | Ergonomically comfortable for most adults. Some wall-hung vanities allow height adjustment |
| **Depth** (front to wall) | 350mm - 550mm | 450mm - 500mm | Slim versions (350mm) available for narrow spaces. Standard depth is 450mm |
| **Width** | 400mm - 1800mm | 600, 750, 900, 1200, 1500, 1800mm | Off-the-shelf widths. Custom sizes available from cabinet makers |
| **Basin depth** (bowl) | 120mm - 180mm | 150mm | Deeper basins reduce splashing |

**Confidence:** HIGH (consistent across multiple Australian manufacturers including Timberline, ADP, Marquis)

## 2. Vanity Construction -- Moisture Resistance

**Confidence:** HIGH (manufacturer technical data)

Moisture resistance is the single most critical factor in bathroom cabinetry material selection. Standard materials used in dry-area cabinetry (standard particleboard, standard MDF) will swell, delaminate, and fail in wet-area environments.

### 2.1 Material Comparison Table

| Material | Moisture Rating | Cost Level | Best Application | Key Properties |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard particleboard** | POOR -- not suitable | Lowest | NOT for wet areas | Swells and splits when exposed to moisture. Must never be specified for bathrooms or laundries |
| **HMR particleboard** | GOOD | Budget-Mid | Vanity carcasses (budget builds) | High Moisture Resistant. Wood particles bonded with water-resistant resin. Will not swell under normal bathroom humidity. Common in flat-pack and mid-range vanities |
| **MR MDF** | GOOD | Mid | Vanity doors, drawer fronts, painted cabinetry | Moisture Resistant MDF. Wood fibres bonded with water-resistant resin. Smoother surface than HMR particleboard -- ideal for painted finishes. Preferred for profile routing (shaker-style doors) |
| **Marine plywood** | EXCELLENT | High | High-end vanities, areas with direct water contact risk, commercial | Complies with BS 1088 or AS/NZS 2272. Cross-laminated veneers with waterproof phenolic resin glue. Will not delaminate. Specify for areas of high moisture exposure or where longevity is paramount |
| **Exterior-grade plywood** | VERY GOOD | Mid-High | Vanity carcasses (mid-high builds), structural backing | A-bond glue line. Not as stringent as marine grade but suitable for most residential bathroom applications |
| **Solid timber** | VARIABLE | High | Feature elements, timber vanity tops | Requires appropriate species selection (hardwoods or naturally resistant species). Must be sealed on all surfaces. Risk of warping and movement in wet environments |
| **Solid surface (Corian, HI-MACS)** | EXCELLENT | Premium | Vanity tops, integrated basins | Non-porous acrylic/mineral blend. Seamless -- no joints for moisture ingress. Silica-free (relevant post-2024 Australian engineered stone ban). Repairable |

### 2.2 Detailed Material Notes

#### HMR Particleboard
- **Identification:** Typically has a green-coloured core (industry standard colour coding)
- **Australian standard:** Must comply with AS/NZS 1859.1, E1 formaldehyde emission grade (low formaldehyde)
- **Common thickness:** 16mm (carcass panels), 33mm (benchtop substrate)
- **Limitations:** While moisture resistant, it is NOT waterproof. Prolonged direct water exposure will still cause damage. All cut edges must be sealed
- **Scope impact:** Budget vanities and laundry cabinets. Acceptable for most residential bathroom applications when properly edge-sealed

#### MR MDF (Moisture Resistant Medium Density Fibreboard)
- **Identification:** Green-coloured core (same colour coding as HMR particleboard)
- **Australian standard:** Must comply with AS/NZS 1859.2, E1 formaldehyde emission grade
- **Common thickness:** 16mm, 18mm (doors and panels), 25mm, 33mm (benchtops)
- **Key advantage over HMR particleboard:** Smoother, denser surface allows for routed profiles, painted finishes without visible grain. Superior for doors and visible panels
- **Scope impact:** Preferred substrate for painted vanity doors. Often used in combination with HMR particleboard (MR MDF doors on HMR particleboard carcass)

#### Marine Plywood
- **Standard:** BS 1088 (international) or AS/NZS 2272 (Australian/NZ)
- **Common thickness:** 12mm, 15mm, 18mm
- **Species:** Meranti/Mersawa (common in Australia), Gaboon/Okoume
- **Key advantage:** Superior dimensional stability. Will not delaminate or swell even under prolonged moisture exposure
- **When to specify:** Commercial bathrooms, high-end residential, areas where cabinet carcass is partially exposed (open shelving in bathroom), or where builder/owner demands maximum durability
- **Scope impact:** Higher material cost but reduces risk of warranty claims. Specify for vanity carcasses where budget allows

### 2.3 Edge Banding in Wet Areas

Edge banding seals the exposed raw edges of board materials (particleboard, MDF) and is absolutely critical in wet-area cabinetry. Unsealed edges are the primary point of moisture ingress and the leading cause of cabinet failure in bathrooms and laundries.

| Edge Banding Type | Moisture Suitability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PVC edge banding** | EXCELLENT | Inherently waterproof. Maintains structural integrity in high-humidity conditions. Preferred for all wet-area cabinetry |
| **ABS edge banding** | GOOD | Suitable for high-humidity environments. Should not be exposed to prolonged direct water contact. More environmentally friendly than PVC |
| **Melamine edge tape** | FAIR | Basic protection only. Acceptable for upper cabinets and areas not exposed to direct water |
| **Timber veneer edge** | POOR in wet areas | Will absorb moisture unless heavily sealed. Not recommended for wet-area base cabinets |

#### Adhesive Type Matters

| Adhesive | Suitability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PUR (Polyurethane Reactive)** | BEST for wet areas | Creates a watertight, heat-resistant seal. Cross-links chemically -- bond is permanent and moisture-proof |
| **EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate)** | ACCEPTABLE | Standard hot-melt adhesive. Adequate for most residential applications but can soften under sustained heat/moisture |

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> When specifying bathroom or laundry cabinetry, the scope should state: "All exposed board edges to be sealed with PVC or ABS edge banding. No raw/unsealed edges permitted on any cabinet component in wet areas." This is a quality checkpoint that prevents the most common mode of cabinet failure.

## 3. Mirror Cabinets

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (manufacturer data, industry practice)

### 3.1 Surface Mount vs Recessed (In-Wall)

| Feature | Surface Mount | Recessed (In-Wall) |
|---|---|---|
| **Installation** | Fixed directly to wall surface with screws. Protrudes 100-150mm from wall | Set into wall cavity. Sits flush or near-flush with wall surface |
| **Wall requirements** | Any wall type (plasterboard, masonry, tile). Must fix to studs or use appropriate anchors | Requires stud wall (timber or steel frame). Cannot recess into masonry/brick/block walls without significant work |
| **Framing modifications** | None | Requires cutting plasterboard, possibly cutting/relocating a stud, adding header and sill framing |
| **Depth into wall** | N/A | Typically 100-130mm recess depth (limited by stud depth -- 70mm or 90mm studs) |
| **Visual impact** | Cabinet protrudes from wall | Seamless, modern appearance. Makes small bathrooms feel more spacious |
| **Scope complexity** | Simple -- fit-off stage only | Requires rough-in stage carpentry (framing), coordination with plasterer, then fit-off |

### 3.2 Recessed Cabinet -- Structural Implications

When recessing a mirror cabinet into a stud wall:

| Consideration | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Stud spacing** | Standard Australian stud spacing is 450mm or 600mm centres. A cabinet wider than one stud bay requires cutting a stud |
| **Header and sill** | If a stud is cut, a horizontal header (above) and sill (below) must be installed to transfer load. Use same timber dimension as studs (typically 70x35mm or 90x35mm) |
| **Load-bearing walls** | Do NOT cut studs in load-bearing walls without engineering advice. Recessed cabinets should only be installed in non-load-bearing partition walls unless engineered |
| **Services in wall** | Check for electrical cables, plumbing pipes, and ducting before cutting. May require electrician to relocate wiring |
| **Plasterboard patching** | Plasterboard must be cut to the cabinet recess dimension and patched/finished by plasterer |

### 3.3 Electrical Integration

Many mirror cabinets include integrated LED lighting, shaver outlets (two-pin), USB charging ports, demister pads, and sensor switches. These features require electrical coordination.

| Electrical Feature | Trade Responsibility | Coordination Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **LED lighting (hardwired)** | Electrician | Requires dedicated circuit or connection to bathroom lighting circuit. Electrician must rough-in cable to cabinet location during rough-in stage. Cable termination point must be confirmed with cabinet supplier dimensions |
| **LED lighting (plug-in)** | Electrician provides GPO behind/above cabinet | Simpler -- just needs a concealed GPO. Cable management behind cabinet |
| **Shaver outlet / USB** | Built into cabinet (transformer integrated) | Cabinet's internal transformer is typically connected to the hardwired supply. Electrician installs the supply; cabinet manufacturer supplies the transformer |
| **Demister pad** | Electrician | Requires separate switched circuit or connection to lighting circuit. Low wattage (~40W for typical mirror demister) |
| **Sensor switch** | Built into cabinet | No additional electrical work beyond providing power supply to the cabinet |

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> Mirror cabinet with electrical features requires: (1) Electrician to rough-in cable to cabinet location BEFORE plasterboard; (2) Carpenter/cabinet installer to install cabinet at fit-off; (3) Electrician to connect and commission at fit-off. The scope must specify the cabinet make/model early so the electrician knows the connection requirements and cable termination point.

### 3.4 Standard Mirror Cabinet Dimensions

| Size Category | Width | Height | Depth (surface mount) | Common Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Single door** | 450-600mm | 600-750mm | 130-150mm | 1 mirrored door, 2-3 internal shelves |
| **Double door** | 750-900mm | 600-750mm | 130-150mm | 2 mirrored doors, 2-3 internal shelves |
| **Triple door** | 900-1200mm | 600-750mm | 130-150mm | 3 mirrored doors, suited to double vanity |
| **Extra wide** | 1200-1500mm | 600-750mm | 130-150mm | 3-4 mirrored doors, premium installations |

**Recessed depth:** Typically 100-130mm into wall cavity (limited by stud depth minus plasterboard thickness)

## 4. Laundry Cabinets and Benchtops

**Confidence:** HIGH (Australian manufacturer data and industry practice)

### 4.1 Standard Laundry Cabinet Configurations

Australian laundries typically include a combination of under-bench cabinets, overhead wall cabinets, and tall utility storage. The layout is driven by the positions of the washing machine, dryer, and trough/sink.

| Cabinet Type | Typical Width | Typical Depth | Height | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Trough/sink base cabinet** | 600mm, 900mm | 500-600mm | 870-900mm | Houses the laundry trough. Available as single (45L) or double (70L) configurations |
| **Drawer base cabinet** | 450mm, 600mm | 500-600mm | 870-900mm | General storage beside the trough |
| **Open washing machine space** | 600-700mm | 650mm minimum | 870-900mm | No cabinet -- open bay for front-loading washing machine. Benchtop spans above |
| **Overhead wall cabinet** | 600mm, 900mm, 1200mm | 300mm (standard) | 600-720mm | Fixed above benchtop for cleaning products and supplies. 300mm depth prevents head-bumping |
| **Tall broom/utility cupboard** | 500-600mm | 500-600mm | 2100mm (floor to ceiling) | For brooms, mops, vacuum cleaner, ironing board. Minimum 500mm width recommended |

### 4.2 Trough / Sink Integration

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Standard trough sizes** | Small: 45L (approximately 555 x 455 x 240mm). Large: 70L (approximately 600 x 500 x 280mm) |
| **Material** | Stainless steel, polymer/acrylic, or ceramic. Stainless steel most common in Australian laundries |
| **Installation type** | Drop-in (over-mount), under-mount, or integrated (cabinet + trough sold as one unit) |
| **Plumbing coordination** | Plumber roughs in hot/cold supply and waste to suit trough position. Waste outlet typically at rear of cabinet. Carpenter must confirm trough dimensions with plumber before building/ordering cabinets |
| **Bypass/overflow** | Many troughs include bypass for washing machine drainage. Plumber connects washing machine waste hose to trough bypass or to a separate floor waste |

### 4.3 Benchtop Materials for Laundry

| Material | Cost | Durability | Moisture Resistance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Laminate (HPL)** | Low-Mid | Good | Good (if edges sealed) | Most common choice for laundries. Wide range of colours and finishes. Standard thickness 33mm (with particleboard substrate). Must use HMR substrate in laundry |
| **Compact laminate** | Mid | Excellent | Excellent | 13mm solid laminate -- no substrate required. Non-porous, waterproof throughout. Ideal for laundry benchtops. No edge sealing concerns |
| **Engineered stone** | High | Excellent | Excellent | NOTE: As of July 2024, a national ban on engineered stone benchtop fabrication is in effect in Australia due to silicosis risk. Pre-fabricated engineered stone products may still be available. Check current regulations |
| **Stone (natural granite, marble)** | High | Excellent (granite), variable (marble) | Excellent (granite) | Durable but premium cost for a laundry. Granite is practical; marble stains easily with laundry chemicals |
| **Solid surface (Corian, HI-MACS)** | High | Excellent | Excellent | Silica-free. Seamless -- no joints. Can integrate sink/trough into benchtop. Repairable. Good option post-engineered-stone ban |
| **Timber** | Mid-High | Fair (requires maintenance) | Fair (requires sealing) | Must be sealed on all surfaces and resealed periodically. Can warp if seal fails. Not recommended for heavy-use laundries |
| **Polyurethane-coated MR MDF** | Mid | Good | Good | Painted finish over moisture-resistant substrate. Common in custom joinery. Must be fully sealed including underside |

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> Laundry benchtop must be specified with a minimum depth of 650mm (deeper than kitchen standard of 600mm) to accommodate laundry trough depth and washing machine hoses tucked behind.

### 4.4 Overhead Storage

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Standard depth** | 300mm -- shallower than base cabinets to prevent head-bumping when standing at the bench |
| **Clearance above benchtop** | Minimum 600mm from benchtop surface to underside of overhead cabinet |
| **Clearance for hanging rail** | If a hanging rail is included under overhead cabinets, allow minimum 800mm clearance from benchtop to cabinet underside |
| **Fixing** | Must be fixed to wall studs (not plasterboard only). Use through-back screws into studs. Minimum 2 fixing points per cabinet |
| **Material** | Same moisture-resistant materials as base cabinets (HMR particleboard or MR MDF minimum). Often overlooked -- specify moisture-rated material for overhead cabinets too |

### 4.5 Broom Cupboard / Utility Storage

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Minimum width** | 500mm (to fit broom, mop, vacuum cleaner handle) |
| **Depth** | 500-600mm |
| **Height** | Full height -- floor to ceiling (typically 2100-2400mm) |
| **Internal fittings** | Hooks on inside of door for dustpan/broom clips. Single shelf at top. Consider pull-out ironing board fitting if space permits |
| **Door type** | Hinged door (single, full-height) most common. Bifold acceptable if clearance is limited |

---

## 5. Linen Cupboards

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (industry practice, Australian manufacturer data)

### 5.1 Built-In vs Freestanding

| Feature | Built-In (Carpenter's Scope) | Freestanding (Not Carpenter's Scope) |
|---|---|---|
| **Construction** | Framed into wall cavity or built as a boxed unit fixed to wall and floor | Purchased as furniture piece, delivered and placed |
| **Customisation** | Fully custom to space -- fits floor to ceiling, wall to wall | Standard sizes only |
| **Integration** | Seamless with surrounding walls when plastered and painted | Sits against wall with visible gaps |
| **Scope impact** | Included in carpentry scope. Requires framing, shelving, door hanging | NOT typically in carpentry scope -- owner-supplied item |

### 5.2 Standard Dimensions for Built-In Linen Cupboards

| Dimension | Standard Range | Most Common | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Width** | 450mm - 1200mm | 600mm, 900mm | Narrower for hallway cupboards. Wider for bathroom linen storage |
| **Depth** | 350mm - 600mm | 450mm - 580mm | Must be deep enough for folded towels (standard bath towel folded = ~350mm) |
| **Height** | Floor to ceiling | 2100mm - 2400mm | Utilise full height for maximum storage. Top shelf may require a step to reach |

### 5.3 Shelf Spacing and Adjustability

| Specification | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Fixed shelves** | Bottom shelf at 200-300mm AFL (prevents towels sitting on floor). Remaining shelves at 300-400mm intervals |
| **Adjustable shelves** | Preferred -- use adjustable shelf pins (32mm system or 5mm shelf pin holes at 32mm increments) |
| **Recommended shelf spacing** | 300-380mm between shelves for folded towels and linen. 450mm for bulkier items (blankets, pillows) |
| **Shelf material** | 16mm or 18mm MR MDF or HMR particleboard. Shelves wider than 800mm should be 18mm minimum or include a central support to prevent sagging |
| **Number of shelves** | Typically 5-7 shelves in a 2100mm high cupboard |
| **Maximum span without support** | 800mm for 16mm board, 900mm for 18mm board (loaded with linen). Beyond this, add a centre divider or use thicker material |

### 5.4 Door Types for Linen Cupboards

| Door Type | Best For | Clearance Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single hinged door** | Cupboards up to 600mm wide | Door swing radius = cupboard width | Most common. Simple, durable. Provides full-width access |
| **Double hinged doors** | Cupboards 600mm - 1200mm wide | Half-width swing each side | Better for wider cupboards. Each door is lighter |
| **Bifold doors** | Narrow hallways, limited clearance | Half of single-door swing | Opens by folding in half. Good for tight spaces but slightly reduces opening width |
| **Sliding doors** | Where no door swing space exists | Zero clearance | Only half the cupboard is accessible at a time. Not ideal for linen access |

---

## 6. Shaving Cabinets

**Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH (Australian industry terminology and product data)

### 6.1 Distinction from Mirror Cabinets

In Australian building and renovation terminology, "shaving cabinet" and "mirror cabinet" are often used interchangeably. However, there is a traditional distinction:

| Feature | Shaving Cabinet (Traditional) | Mirror Cabinet (Modern) |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary function** | Mirror for shaving with small storage behind | Full storage cabinet with mirrored doors |
| **Size** | Typically smaller (single door, 400-600mm wide) | Can be much larger (up to 1500mm wide, multi-door) |
| **Depth** | Shallower (80-100mm) | Deeper (120-150mm) |
| **Internal features** | 2-3 fixed shelves, simple | Multiple adjustable shelves, sometimes with internal power |
| **Electrical** | May include a shaver outlet (two-pin) and basic lighting | May include LED lighting, demister, USB ports, sensor switches |
| **Mounting** | Almost always surface-mounted | Surface-mounted or recessed |

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> In Australian renovation scopes, "shaving cabinet" typically refers to any mirrored cabinet above a bathroom vanity, regardless of size. The AI should treat "shaving cabinet" and "mirror cabinet" as equivalent terms unless the specification explicitly distinguishes them. When generating a scope, use the term the homeowner or designer has used -- do not change it.

### 6.2 Shaving Cabinet Standard Dimensions

| Size | Width | Height | Depth |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Small (single door)** | 400-500mm | 600-700mm | 100-130mm |
| **Medium (single/double door)** | 600-750mm | 600-750mm | 120-150mm |
| **Large (double/triple door)** | 900-1200mm | 600-750mm | 120-150mm |

### 6.3 Installation Notes

- Typically positioned centred above vanity basin
- Bottom of cabinet should be approximately 200mm above vanity benchtop (to allow for tap clearance and splashback)
- Top of cabinet should be approximately 1800-2000mm AFL (eye-level centre at approximately 1500-1600mm)
- Surface-mount: fix to wall studs with screws through rear panel. If studs do not align, use toggle bolts rated for cabinet weight + contents
- Recessed: see Section 3.2 above for framing requirements

## 7. Toilet Roll Holder Recesses / Niches

**Confidence:** MEDIUM (trade practice -- scope boundaries vary by project)

### 7.1 Scope Responsibility

A recessed toilet roll holder niche is a small recess built into the wall to house a toilet roll holder flush with the wall surface. The question of trade responsibility depends on the wall construction.

| Wall Type | Who Frames the Niche? | Who Finishes the Niche? |
|---|---|---|
| **Timber-framed stud wall** | **Carpenter** frames the niche opening during rough-in stage (adds horizontal noggings and vertical trimmers to create the opening) | **Tiler** tiles the interior of the niche after waterproofing (if in wet area). **Plasterer** finishes if in a non-tiled area |
| **Steel-framed stud wall** | **Steel framer** or **carpenter** creates the opening using steel or timber noggings | Same as above |
| **Masonry / brick wall** | NOT typically recessed. Surface-mounted holder used instead. If recess is required, it must be chased by the **bricklayer** or **concretor** | Tiler or plasterer finishes |

### 7.2 Standard Niche Sizes for Toilet Roll Holders

| Dimension | Typical Size |
|---|---|
| **Width** | 150-200mm |
| **Height** | 150-200mm |
| **Depth** | 80-100mm (limited by stud depth) |
| **Height above floor** | 600-700mm AFL (approximately seated arm height) |

### 7.3 Scope Inclusion

| Scenario | Include in Carpentry Scope? |
|---|---|
| New timber-framed walls being built | YES -- carpenter frames the niche as part of wall framing |
| Existing timber-framed wall, niche being added | YES -- carpenter cuts opening, adds noggings/trimmers |
| Masonry wall | NO -- not carpentry scope |
| Surface-mounted toilet roll holder (no niche) | NO -- not carpentry scope (fixing only, often done by tiler or plumber) |

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> Only include toilet roll holder niche framing in the carpentry scope if the wall is timber-framed AND the design calls for a recessed holder. Surface-mounted holders are not carpentry scope. If in a wet area (e.g., beside the toilet in a combined bathroom), the niche must be waterproofed -- coordinate with waterproofer.

---

## 8. Shower Niche Framing

**Confidence:** HIGH (building practice, AS 3740 coordination)

### 8.1 Carpenter's Scope

In a timber-framed wall, the carpenter is responsible for framing the shower niche opening. This is a rough-in stage task completed before plasterboard/wall lining, waterproofing, and tiling.

### 8.2 Standard Shower Niche Sizes

| Niche Size | Width | Height | Depth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Small (single)** | 300mm | 300mm | 70-90mm | Fits between standard 450mm stud centres (one bay). Minimal structural impact. Soap/shampoo holder |
| **Standard (single)** | 300mm | 600mm | 70-90mm | Most common. Fits between 450mm stud centres. Sufficient for multiple bottles |
| **Large (single)** | 300mm | 900mm | 70-90mm | Tall niche for extensive storage. Still fits in one stud bay |
| **Wide (double bay)** | 600mm | 300-600mm | 70-90mm | Spans two stud bays (requires cutting one stud). Needs header and sill. More structural work |
| **Extra wide** | 900mm+ | 300-600mm | 70-90mm | Requires cutting multiple studs. Engineering advice recommended. Header must transfer load |

**Niche depth** is determined by the stud depth minus the wall lining thickness:
- 70mm studs: approximately 55-60mm usable niche depth (after lining and tile)
- 90mm studs: approximately 75-80mm usable niche depth (after lining and tile)

### 8.3 Structural Considerations

| Consideration | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Single stud bay niche (300mm wide)** | Fits between existing studs. No studs need to be cut. Carpenter adds horizontal noggings (top and bottom of niche) between the two flanking studs. Minimal structural impact |
| **Multi-stud bay niche (600mm+ wide)** | One or more studs must be cut. Must be framed like a window opening: header above, sill below, trimmer studs on each side. Header must transfer the load of the cut stud(s) to the trimmer studs |
| **Load-bearing walls** | Exercise extreme caution. If the shower wall is load-bearing, DO NOT cut studs without engineering advice. Consider limiting niche width to a single stud bay (no stud cutting required) or using a surface-mounted niche box instead |
| **Non-load-bearing walls** | Less structural concern but still frame properly for durability and to support tile weight |
| **Double-sided walls** | If the wall has fixtures/niches on both sides (e.g., shower niche on one side, recessed mirror cabinet on the other), ensure framing accommodates both without conflicting |

### 8.4 Framing Method

1. **Mark niche position** on studs according to design drawings (confirm height with designer/owner)
2. **Cut horizontal noggings** to fit between studs (same timber dimension as studs)
3. **Fix noggings** at top and bottom of niche opening using skew-nailing, framing brackets, or triple-grip connectors
4. **If stud must be cut:** cut stud at niche top and bottom, install header nogging above and sill nogging below, add trimmer studs if needed
5. **Check niche is square and plumb** -- critical for tile finish
6. **Slight slope on bottom nogging** -- slope the bottom of the niche 2-3mm toward the shower opening to prevent water pooling (coordinate with tiler)

### 8.5 Waterproofing Implications

The shower niche is within the shower wet zone and must be fully waterproofed in accordance with AS 3740:2021.

| Waterproofing Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Membrane coverage** | All internal surfaces of the niche (top, bottom, sides, back) must be waterproofed with a compliant membrane |
| **Substrate** | Wall lining inside the niche must be a waterproofing-compatible substrate: compressed fibre cement sheet (e.g., Villaboard, Hardietex) preferred. Water-resistant plasterboard (e.g., Aquachek) is acceptable but fibre cement is superior for niches |
| **Bond breakers** | Bond breaker tape at all internal corners of the niche (niche-to-wall junctions) |
| **Minimum membrane height** | The waterproof membrane on the shower wall must extend to minimum 1800mm above finished floor level or 50mm above the shower rose outlet, whichever is higher. The niche is included in this zone |
| **Tiler's responsibility** | Tiler tiles the niche interior after waterproofing. Tiler is responsible for ensuring tile falls within the niche drain toward the shower |

#### Key Scope Note for AI

> Shower niche framing is ALWAYS carpenter's scope in a timber-framed wall. The scope should specify: niche quantity, niche dimensions, niche position (height above floor, centred on wall or offset). Include a coordination note: "Carpenter to frame niche(s). Waterproofer to membrane all internal niche surfaces. Tiler to tile niche interior with bottom sloped toward shower." This three-trade coordination is critical and must be explicit in the scope.

### 8.6 Alternative: Pre-Fabricated Niche Inserts

Pre-fabricated niche inserts (stainless steel, tile-ready foam, or composite) are available and simplify installation:

| Type | Material | Installation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tile-ready foam niche** | EPS foam (e.g., Schluter KERDI-BOARD-SN) | Glued into framed opening. Tiler tiles over it | Waterproof, lightweight, pre-formed. Reduces waterproofing risk |
| **Stainless steel niche** | 304 or 316 stainless steel | Tiled or fixed flush into framed opening | No tiling required inside niche. Clean, modern look. Fully waterproof |
| **Composite niche** | Various polymers | Fixed into framed opening | Pre-finished. No tiling needed |

Even with pre-fabricated inserts, the carpenter still frames the opening. The insert goes in after framing and before tiling.

## 9. Trade Coordination Summary

The following table summarises which trade is responsible for each scope item in bathroom and laundry cabinetry work. This is the critical coordination matrix for the AI scope generator.

### 9.1 Bathroom Cabinetry -- Trade Responsibility Matrix

| Scope Item | Carpenter | Plumber | Electrician | Waterproofer | Tiler | Plasterer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vanity supply (order/deliver)** | Owner/builder | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Wall backing for wall-hung vanity** | YES (rough-in) | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Vanity installation** | YES (fit-off) | Connects waste & water | Connects power (if applicable) | - | - | - |
| **Mirror/shaving cabinet -- surface mount** | YES (fit-off) | - | Connects power (if LED/electrical) | - | - | - |
| **Mirror/shaving cabinet -- recessed** | YES (rough-in framing + fit-off install) | - | Rough-in cable + fit-off connection | - | - | Patches plasterboard around recess |
| **Shower niche framing** | YES (rough-in) | - | - | Membranes niche interior | Tiles niche interior | - |
| **Toilet roll holder niche** | YES (rough-in, timber walls only) | - | - | Membranes if in wet area | Tiles if in tiled area | Finishes if in plastered area |
| **Linen cupboard** | YES (framing + shelving + doors) | - | - | - | - | May plaster around frame |

### 9.2 Laundry Cabinetry -- Trade Responsibility Matrix

| Scope Item | Carpenter | Plumber | Electrician | Tiler | Plasterer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Base cabinets** | YES (install) | - | - | Floor tiles before cabinets | - |
| **Trough/sink cabinet** | YES (install) | Connects trough waste, hot/cold supply, washing machine bypass | - | - | - |
| **Benchtop** | YES (install, unless stone -- see note) | Plumber may need to template for under-mount sink | - | Splashback tiles after benchtop | - |
| **Overhead wall cabinets** | YES (install, fix to studs) | - | - | - | - |
| **Broom cupboard** | YES (build and install) | - | - | - | - |
| **Appliance provisions** | Ensures correct openings for washer/dryer | Washing machine taps, dryer vent (if vented) | GPO for washer and dryer | - | - |

**Note on stone benchtops:** Stone benchtops (natural stone, solid surface) are typically measured, fabricated, and installed by a specialist stone mason / solid surface fabricator -- not the carpenter. The carpenter installs the base cabinets and ensures they are level; the stone fabricator templates and installs the benchtop afterward.

### 9.3 Sequencing Summary

The typical installation sequence for bathroom cabinetry in an Australian renovation:

| Stage | Order | Tasks | Trades Involved |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Rough-in** | First | Frame shower niches, frame recessed cabinet openings, install wall backing/nogging for wall-hung vanity | Carpenter |
| **2. Plumbing rough-in** | After framing | Rough-in water supply and waste to vanity/trough/basin positions | Plumber |
| **3. Electrical rough-in** | After framing | Rough-in cables for mirror cabinet lighting, GPOs, exhaust fan | Electrician |
| **4. Wall lining** | After rough-in | Plasterboard / fibre cement sheet lining (including niche interiors) | Plasterer / Carpenter |
| **5. Waterproofing** | After wall lining | Waterproof membrane to shower, floor, niches, hob areas per AS 3740 | Waterproofer |
| **6. Tiling** | After waterproofing | Wall and floor tiles, niche tiling | Tiler |
| **7. Cabinetry fit-off** | After tiling | Install vanity, mirror/shaving cabinet, laundry cabinets, linen cupboard doors | Carpenter |
| **8. Plumbing fit-off** | After cabinetry | Connect basins, taps, troughs, washing machine | Plumber |
| **9. Electrical fit-off** | After cabinetry | Connect mirror cabinet, GPOs, lighting | Electrician |
