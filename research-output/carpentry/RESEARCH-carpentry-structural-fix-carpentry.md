# Section 4: Structural & Fix Carpentry -- Australian Residential Research

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for ScopeAI scope-of-works generation covering structural carpentry, fix carpentry, timber flooring, and decking in Australian residential construction.
**Confidence Note:** This research is compiled from Australian Standards (AS 1684, NCC/BCA), manufacturer specifications, and established industry practice.

| Bullnose | Simple rounded edge | Versatile; suits most home styles |
| Ovolo | Quarter-round profile | Traditional to transitional homes |
| Pencil round | Small radius on edges only | Modern, clean lines |
| Lambs tongue | Slightly curved/bevelled profile | Heritage and period homes |
| Square edge / Modern | Flat face, minimal profile | Contemporary, minimalist homes |
| Shadow line / Shadowline | Recessed channel at wall-to-frame junction (no architrave) | High-end modern; requires plaster bead detailing |

#### Architrave Dimensions

| Width (mm) | Application | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 42 | Minimal / modern | Sometimes used as window stop bead |
| 66 | Standard / most common | Suits most residential applications |
| 90 | Traditional / feature | Federation and period homes |
| 110+ | Grand / heritage | Double-storey entries, heritage restoration |

**Thickness:** Typically 18mm (standard); 12mm (budget/MDF); 25mm (premium/hardwood).

**Length:** Supplied in 2.4m, 2.7m, 3.0m, 5.4m lengths.

#### Architrave Material Options

| Material | Pros | Cons | Typical Cost Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primed MDF | Smooth finish, no grain, easy to paint, cost-effective | Cannot be stained; swells if wet | Budget |
| Primed pine (finger-jointed) | Paintable, can be stained, good for profiles | Knots may show through paint over time | Mid |

#### Square-Set (No Architrave) Detail

Square-set corners eliminate the need for architrave by creating a clean, flush junction between the wall and door frame. This approach requires:

- Plaster bead (shadow-line bead or square-set bead) installed at the junction
- Plastering to a high standard -- any imperfections are visible
- Door jamb must be flush with plasterboard face
- Higher plasterer skill required; typically increases plastering cost by 20-30%
- Popular in modern/contemporary builds
- Shadow-line gap is typically 10mm

### C3. Sanding and Polishing Existing Timber Floors

#### Process Steps

| Step | Detail | Notes |

| 5. Gap filling | Timber filler or resin filler mixed with sanding dust | Fill gaps, nail holes, cracks; sand smooth after drying |
| 6. Stain (optional) | Water-based or solvent-based timber stain | Applied between final sand and first coat; test on off-cut |
| 7. First coat (sealer) | Polyurethane sealer coat | Penetrates and seals timber; light sand (220 grit) between coats |
| 8. Second coat | Polyurethane or finish coat | Light sand (220 grit) between coats |
